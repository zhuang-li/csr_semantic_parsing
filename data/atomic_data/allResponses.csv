Was this a friend you were in love with_comma_ or just a best friend?
Where has she gone?
Oh was this something that happened because of an argument?
Oh ya? I don't really see how
I do actually hit blank walls a lot of times but i get by
Wait what are sweatings
doing good.. how about you
it's quite strange that you didnt imagine it
And thats something you should never do_comma_ good on you. 
What do you mean it hasn't been easy? How close have you come to cheating? 
Don't be nervous. Just be prepared.
Yes but if you stay calm it will be ok.
Sounds great! So what's your major?
Well pleased. You should be having brains_comma_man!That's a tough course_comma_i hear.
I am sorry to hear that. Did it happen out of the blue?
I am sorry to hear that. I hope it turned out to be a blessing in decise.
Wow_comma_ that must be terrible_comma_ I cannot imagine_comma_ I lvoe christmas
Wow_comma_ I am sorry to hear that_comma_ I wish I could make it a better holiday for you!
I work remotely_comma_ I wish that you could do something like that as well.
Sometimes in life_comma_ it is not about performance. Some people just get a shiner spoon.
Thats a sweet man_comma_ I hope you acknowledged his kind gesture. 
Their aren't that many well rounded people in the world these days so when you see one you should always show appreciation! 
What happened?
I am sorry to hear that. I hope you find a better opportunity. Did you know why they rejected you?
WOW! Did it do any damage?
That is great. I would have been scared to death. Was it recent?
haha yeah that would be very bad !
Oh no _comma_ sorry to hear that happened to you :(
What happened for you to feel that way?
Oh that does sound terrible. What did you guys decide to do?
That's very scary. I hope no one got hurt.
So happy everyone was fine!! Everything else can be fixed.
So good to hear. Might want to trim some trees lol
I saw that game. They won on penalty kicks!
It was very tense. The other game with England and Sweden was not nearly as nerve-wracking.
It must be so frustrating to have to answer the same thing over and over. Is she older?
My aunt does the same thing! I think what she is doing is accidentally deleting texts_comma_ and she doesn't understand how to check her contacts list. What do you think is happening with your co-worker?
What is the problem with the engine?
Sorry to hear that. I hope you find what is the problem with the engine.
I felt sad and depressed due to my insecurities and felt rejected from society
The problem is I don't think you can grew out of my specific insecurity.
I'm not familiar with abseiling_comma_ but I'm glad that you felt good about it.
Oh_comma_ I see. No_comma_ I've never done that.
Hello! I am in such a good mood since I got my new home.
I have a ton of backyard space that we have plans for. Camping would be a fun one.
I want to look in to getting a nice fire pit for the house.
What kind of house are you building? 
That sounds great. What are you most excited for? 
Why did you feel guilty for taking a drink?
I can understand. I am not a big drinker myself_comma_ but I wouldn't feel guilty about it.  Not unless you promised someone you wouldn't drink.
Oh yea I can understand that then... Well I am sure you learned your lesson_comma_ right?
Yeah that sounds really sad. I am sorry for what you went through. 
Yeah maybe that was a good decision that you made. 
wow_comma_ that was so awesome of them!
I had to buy my first car and it wasn't until I was 21 that I could afford it. 
That is where I am still at_comma_ I am scared I will have regrets when I get older
That is good_comma_ I am glad you have no regrets!
what was the topic
I'm not familiar with him where is he from
and how did you learn about him
Yes_comma_ I think that everyone does! What about you?
That's too bad. Our janitor is very friendly.
Is it not better you replace it with same type of statuette_comma_at a grocery store?
The mother of your grand mother _comma_that means your great grand mother ! Well you can search through her archives
What happened?
It is very bad service. What did you do? Did you complain to the manager?
That would be hard to do and take courage. 
I could see that happening but sounds like you were super brave.
Oh_comma_ my_comma_ what happened?
I live near the ocean_comma_ so I do understand how this can be. I hope you ran_comma_ very quickly.
I heard a story of seagulls drowning a man to death.
I was the same way.
Lol. I take away my daughters now. I guess my mom passed the torch.
She is 13 not at 3am
What promise didn't he keep?
Wow that sounds like a terrible friend.  I hope he had a good reason for not showing up.
Wow. Did he have kids?
Ah ok. Good you stayed committed to your wife.
That is very inspiring_comma_ I'm glad you take the extra time. Do you like doing what you do?
That is awesome_comma_ thanks for taking the time to help kids grasp a new language! You deserve to be appreciated_comma_ but I'm sure they appreciate you a lot.
That is heartbreaking_comma_ it's always helped me to remember that no matter what happens_comma_ you have your memories with them.
Absolutely_comma_ it's a chapter of your life and as long as you have those memories they live on through those memories.
I'm sorry to hear that.  That must have been frustrating.
Hopefully you were able to get the ice cream that you wanted in the following days.
Oh no! Glad your dad was able to help. How did it happen?
That's some bad luck. I hope it wasn't too much of a hassle.
Awe how sweet_comma_ I bet those are good memories
I agree with that for sure. 
I bet! That sounds like fun.
What sweet memories to hold on to.
That's awesome! How helpful where the other people so that you could enjoy your trip?
Must have been super fun. How were the local people? How did they treat you?
That's great! Im glad that they took care of you! Have a gret day!
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you know what caused it?
I've done that to myself before. Now I always wait awhile to sleep after eating.
What were you afraid of? 
Oh No_comma_ well glad to see you are here still! 
what is your job position?
That's very bad
What did you do? 
Ouch... Is it just for a day? Is your friend a safe driver?
Yes... If this makes you feel better.. I lent my car to a friend for a week and thank goodness everything was alright. 
Haha my girlfriend does the same thing.  Check comes in and she is so happy to have money for the next two weeks_comma_ then goes and spends it all on clothing and accessories.  
We all deserve to treat ourselves every now and then.
Yeah it's really frustrating when they won't have more eople on. 
Exactly. Hopefully more places will get self-checkout so we can get through the line faster. 
Yeah_comma_ or at least do something to correct that.
or hire more people maybe also
They don't spend money unless they absolutely have to. They get bonuses for saving money I think
And then what?
I understand_comma_ that must suck
Thats terrible... have you gotten a new phone yet? 
Thats true_comma_ but I hope some good luck comes your way soon..
oh well_comma_ where did you move?
wow!! wonderful isn't!! you would have been over the moon once you moved..
Oh no_comma_ that's terrible. Sorry you had to deal with that.
I am sure that threw a wrench in your plans. How frustrating!
whats your favorite food? that was very nice of them
oh nice_comma_ im afraid the most asian food that i like is fortune cookies
That will mess you up for a few days. The only thing I don't like about going away.
Oh no. Hopefully everybody gets back to normal soon.
I only like yard work with the kids. They do most of the work and we have fun in the dirt.
Oh no. The shower is the plus side to all the dirt I guess. I once found a snake digging a hole to plant a flower. I quit that day.
Oh my gosh! I would have been so upset! Nothing is better than chocolates on a bad day.
That's definitely better than nothing. I hope your days have been better since!
Thats so special! What a beautiful moment.. How old is she? 
My daughter is 1.5 years old - shes just been introduced to the water.. its always so special when our babies have their "first" moments. Congrats mama! 
Have  you thought about talking to your boss about it?
You should still speak to him about your concerns.
This is terrible. So sad to hear that. What did you do then?
Did she already move out?
What do you mean? I don't know what you are talking about.
Well then I guess you should have went and checked to see if anyone was hurt. I hope you called a ambulance.
I would have gotten out right then I believe.
I guess you rolled all the windows down too and held your breath
Wao_comma_ that sound like a great strong realtionship you have with her_comma_ so glad to hear that!
When my first daugther was born! i saw in new life_comma_ i thought everything in the world can change_comma_ we need to be pure as kids.
When i see them_comma_ i believe thiw world in which we live fill with envy and hate can be rewed
Thats good that you found the keychain
that's very good! Always nice to find those old lost items.  
That is seriously the worst... waiting around all day wondering whats going on! Have you tried calling him today? 
Of course right_comma_ I would try angies list or homeadvisor! They can find you a new one...
Oh no. I am sure he will get caught eventually though.
Things you do usually come back to you . 
What event was taking place?
That's cool you were on stage for that. Were you one of the musicians?
Oh yeah what are you doing for your vacation? 
Sounds rather special to me! Out of the country or to another state? 
That is great. It is sweet to see them grow and learn. How old is she?
Funny one ha ha
It is so sweet. Is she able to talk?
That should be funny to see and hear
That sucks... what was he or she supposed to help you with? 
Well I hope you two can talk it out_comma_ express your feelings and work it out together! Friendship is hard to come by these days... 
Traveling is hard work. Where did you go?
Wow. I have never neen that far! I have been to the Caribbean though.
Thats awesome_comma_ friends really can be the best. How long have you known them? 
Im glad you have such good friends in your life_comma_ it makes life easier. 
Omg... thats terrible! Im so sorry - Ive been through similar. Are they going to give you some sort of money upon lay off? 
If they have a heart or soul they will! They really should...
That is really cool! Did they tell you why they were giving you the bonus?
Well at least you get something to look forward too at work.
What was it. I've been too busy to notice new movies out.
They do put out good movies most of the time. I will try and check it out. 
What are they doing to cause you to think that?
I have heard that too. You might want to contact your local district.
No problem I hope everything works out
Happy Birthday!!!! What are you going to do for it? 
I hope you get lots and lots! 
Oh no! Bugs really creep me out!
what did the landlor do about it? Did you have to call an exterminator?
Ugh.. that seems like forever away.. can you try to get it sooner? 
Maybe consider looking for a new job in the meantime? Never hurts to stay ahead.. 
That is nice. I like going to water park. What time are you going?
Is it a big water park?
Are you ok_comma_ you have to tell me what happened.
Ahh that has happened to everyone before. It is embarrassing but you will get over it.
Well im glad you were able to cover up.
Oh no. That must have been scary.
Wow. I would've freaked. I can't even have all of the lights out in my apartment.
Glad a bear didn't eat you
How long have you been trying to sell it for?
I'm sure you will sell it soon! 3 months is not such a long time
Did you wait a lot?
Ah ok Congratulation
Shame on them.
You should report him. Anonymously. You should't have to deal with that every day.
Oh no_comma_ that's scary_comma_ is she okay?
That's good_comma_ I'm glad it wasn't serious.
What are they doing that is upsetting you?
Have you made a formal complaint against them yet?
You should report it to your local police department. Building and documenting this can help you.
That happens a lot. What happened next?
I know the feeling. I hate driving now. Everyone is looking in their phone.
I thnk the driving age should be raised to 21 personally
Please tell me that he was friendly and nothing creepy! 
Thank god! LOL I was like please tell me this was a positive experience... 
That would pretty amazing. What will you do with the winning?
I think the same really. Making sure everything is paid off_comma_ having a roof over your head_comma_ etc... is what most people would want to take caer of first.
Good for you! Studying can be a real challenge sometimes.
Awesome_comma_ that's the best way to go into exam. I'm sure you'll do great!
That is great. Probably he think that you are doing a great job.
That is good
That's awful_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that. I lost my job once as well and times got really hard. What kind of stuff are you doing to try and avoid that outcome?
Well_comma_ at the time I was holding out for a similar paying job like I had before but I could not find one and I ended up working fast food. I had to downsize my place as well.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY! Do you have any plans for today?
That is really cool_comma_ Where did you guys on your trip?
I live in Texas so that it really close to me
Oh no. That's not right.
Lol. Why didnt' you just reschedule?
So you said you were going out of town. That's hilarious.
wow! That's awesome! Did you accept the job offer?
yes_comma_ i understand. sometimes you just get a gut feeling that something isn't right
Bummer!!! Are you looking for a work at home job or just an outside job? 
I hear ya.. I hope you find one soon... wishing you all of the best! 
I do that all of time.
Lol. Poor Max. I bet sometimes dogs wished the spoke English for that very reason.
Shame on you. I'm telling
O wow that is a long time_comma_ Are you happy with it?
Im sorry to hear that sometimes people grow apart. You should try to throw a party and see who comes.
congratulations! I know_comma_ it probably feels lonely. Maybe you should do a party at your house and invite all the neighbours
you can't go wrong with some grilled food :) burgers_comma_ wings_comma_ hot dogs 
I would have went running like forest gump - what did you do? 
Going to have to burn the whole house down now_comma_ and move... LOL just joking! 
Oh no. Did they say why?
Hopefully it might be reconsidered later on.
Is she ok? Im glad you were close by!
That is really cool of you to do_comma_ Did anyone else see it happen?
That's terrible. Employers just don't value their employees sometimes.
I hope so_comma_ too. Have you considered working elsewhere?
Oh no... were they relaxed about it or did it cause a problem? 
Well glad they didnt freak out on you_comma_ some people arent as understanding. I bet it was pricey. 
Why is that?
Well I just bought a great bathing suit that covers up all the extras but still shows a little skin and makes me feel good. Maybe that will work for you.
That's good to hear. Where did you get it from?
I gotcha. I bought mine online too. 
oh no sorry to hear that. I just lost mine in November. It's hard.
People say it gets easier. I'm still waiting for that part.
I hope so. Nice chatting with you.
I hear ya. Anyway to get a new job?
Got ya. What kind of work do you currently do?
I dont like rude people either did you tell him? 
Oh god.. give it a few days and then try to sort it out! 
Oh yeah I am sure it is.. have you talked to them about paying for it? 
That really sucks.. i guess all you can do is get a metal type of fence or maybe one with spikes! ( lol ) 
Wow! Have you been to many places?
I've been in the same place. DC and then its neighbor_comma_ MD.
MY brothers are the same way. At least yours ginally came around.
two younger ones. They only call when they want something. my older sister is the same. I'm the good one.
Happy Birthday! Is the call from the ex a good or bad thing?
Exes are exes for a reason I guess lol.
That's not good. I know my eyes hurt when staring at the bright white screen on computers . So I change them to a darker color when possible.
Haven't tried that yet_comma_ but I have heard of it. I will check it out. thanks !
Nostalgia. Is there another HS nearby for the kids to go to?
That's pretty terrible. Thirty minutes in a day pretty much just commuting one way. School is already tough.
Aw thats so nice_comma_ how did she surprise you? 
Cakes! yessss winning. :) 
Thats too bad. What happened?
Thats horrible. Sorry to hear.
Awesome! Happy Birthday to you! Where are you going? 
That seriously sounds like the best birthday ever... i hope you guys have an awesome time. 
Did you get hit my it? I bet that was scary.
Im glad you are ok_comma_ How is your community.
Wow that's awesome. I went back at 31. Still going.
I am studying Criminal Justice now. Hopefully I will be done soon.
Did you go through a breakup recently?
Happy Birthday! Well_comma_ you can order out of course. 
What happened to him? How are they doing?
That is understanable_comma_ I would be the same way.
Oh man. What happened?
Did you end up getting a ticket?
That is a nice thing you are doing for her though. Maybe you could hire somebody for a few hours a week and join a gym or yoga class. 
Go to a walking path or park. Maybe to a dog park also. 
Can't always help unfortunately. I hope the little guy made it_comma_ too!
I wonder how they get all the way to the road away from the other turtles!
I am sorry to hear that.. is there any physical therapy that can help her? 
Usually moving your body helps but it depends on her situation... i would get a 2nd opinion!
How many hours do you have left?
haha not bad! where are you going on vacation?
Thats great_comma_ was the result good?
That's great. How happy were you?
Did it bite you? Are you ok?
Im glad you are ok. Some of those are poisonous and can kill.
Wow That's amazing. You must be very proud of her.  I think coding_comma_ etc_comma_ seems very hard.
Very inspirational story. They make good money too.
That's amazing! How do you anticipate dealing with people who are afraid of needles?
That's good thinking. I hope you won't get too many who are afraid!
Thats good. Make sure you follow up.
That's great. Would this be a good job?
Good luck! I hope you'll win!
Well_comma_ you never know. It's nice to think what you can do with the money though.
I'm so sorry to hear that. How sad for you.
Did he ditch you as well? And how did the girlfriend react?
Very nice! Where was the party?
That's really sweet of them. Must've been a big party.
Thats so terrible! :( Im really sorry... you should do something special everyday and make memories! 
It really doesnt.. i had to put my dog to sleep and it was extremely painful. I really hope that he can rest without pain and that you can feel better soon.. 
Did you tell your spouse? I really think they should know.
Some would consider it cheating if you did not tell them.
I know what you mean... but for now maybe you can just car pool around with your friend until you can get one! 
So you can ride in style for free. Sounds fair to me.. until you get yours! :) 
oh no. I'm sorry to hear that.
I don't. My apartment won't allow_comma_ but we are moving soon I hope to get a cat.
Oh_comma_ I bet that was fun and interesting visiting another country too.
I like to try different types of food from other places too. Then try to make them later on.
That can be stressful. I hope you get the sale. What will you do afterwards?
Do you prefer the isolation?
Awesome! Where are you headed to? 
OMG!!!!! That sounds amazing! Its going to be epic. I hope you have a great time. 
That's really considerate of you. Do they need your help a lot?
Wow. Home selling can be tough. I hope that debt clears up real soon!
That's sucks. You just have to warm up to people.
I would be so scared to move to a new place. I commend you. It'll get better
What happened?!
Oh no. Did you end up having to leave the cart?
Do you usually get a live one ?
Just a small fake one. Some people get really into decorating. I don't really like it. 
That sucks..... always bad to see something like that. Did you atleast enjoy your trip? 
Aw thats good! Im glad you still had a good time. 
surprise party or intervention
How sweet! I hope someone throws me one one day.
That is exciting and scary all at the same time
I could understand that_comma_ Does she know anyone at her new school?
life was simple then wasnt it! very cute. 
I know what you mean. I miss being little myself. 
Oh no that is not good
Did you finally find it
That's gotta be terrible. Why did they pick him instead of you?
I'm sorry to hear. Will you have another chance to get promoted?
O im sorry to hear that! How did it happen?
Does he not have a chance to regain his eyesite?
What a beautiful memory that you will always have though... have you tried to be friends again? 
I get it.. but you know life really is too short.. i think you should try to reach out! Do it! :) 
What happened?!
Oh no. Guess they have finally reached that rebellious age. What did you do?
I have no idea what that is.
Oh is it and action movie.
What did you do with it? Did you try to kill it?
Thats what I would have done. Did they get it taken care of?
O No! Are they going to offer you any kind of package?
Im sorry to hear that. Maybe you should contact your HR and see what your options are
How is it looking? 
There you go! Thats awesome.. i really wish we had a garage. lol lucky!
oh no. I'm sorry to hear that.
OF course. Pets are family.
What charities do you like to give too
That is a very nice thing to do_comma_ I wish I could do more to help.
I just put all my change in a giant bottle.
I hope someone turns it in soon to you.. did you lose out on money too? 
Yeah a real pain honestly... im sorry that happened to you. :/ 
Did you buy tickets or win them?
Yeah
What game did they win?
Really? I don't recall that at all. I remember them choking. I could be wrong.
That sucks. Are you ok?
Thats good. Did the clocks all reset?
I bet that was rather fun_comma_ how fast did you get it going? 
Wow! You are crazy_comma_ ha ha - i probably would have had a panic attack at 90MPH. :p
Thats great.I  change my oil all the time.
Yes my dad taught me also.
Try online dating! Its actually really fun... have you tried it? 
Dont feel that way... theres someone out there for everyone. Give it a try. :) 
Were you able to get her help in time! How is she doing?
That is good to hear! Yeah situations like that can be really alarming.
Thats not right. How did you feel?
That's good. How did you do?
Im sorry to hear that. Was it from age or complications?
Yeah that is not good. But everyone does have a time to go you know?
were you afraid of the dark?
i slept in my mom's room because i was always afraid of the dark
Did she land?
Sweet. Did the crowd cheer?
Wow that is great! When are you going to start?
That is really great! How does that make you feel?
Why don't you say something?
That isn't nice.
oh gosh_comma_ me too!! especially the clown from the movie IT
i slept with a light on for a couple of night lol
That sounds really nice! Did you stay near the ocean?
I remember throwing food over and watching them catch it as a kid.
What did it say?
That is so sweet. Give him twenty dollars. 
I bet he would love that.
oh no :( maybe you should confess and i'm sure you will feel better
i understand. maybe next time you shouldn't cheay
Sorry to hear that.
Yes. I have lost my grandma.
That is a terrible thing to happen_comma_ I'm sure...
I'm happy that you are still here as well! Think of the alternative :(
Nice_comma_ how was the water.
Thats funny. Did you get them all?
Mw too. I don't even llike when it's too dark inside or outside.
Maybe we are ghosts.
I live in Texas_comma_ We really dont have to worry about them here.
Texas is a great place! But I can understand the need to want to be prepared.
How much?
Cool. What kind of car.
That is terrible_comma_ does it smell?
You should tell someone.
I think it's my turn to win the lottery
Sure_comma_ That's sounds like a real plan. lol
what did he do?
yes_comma_ i can see how it can bbe annoying
awww. don't tell anyone but my son is my favorite child. I have two girls also.
How old is your son now?
I love Halloween.
I love candy.
Where did you meet her?
Thats cool. Will you see her again?
I bet! It has to feel like a huge accomplishment.
I did not know you had a 4.0! How do your parents feel about that.
Nice. Did you take it?
Nice did you take it?
Good luck! Do your best. you sound well prepapred.
I hope you get it!
I'm not actually in America so I don't share the same joy as you :p
That's always the positive side of hitting rock bottom right?
That's terrible. Do you think they'll take care of it>
Hope you don't end up in court.
I think that's the usual for kids. How old is she
That's kind of funny though. How did she react?
You should never lie to them. What did you say?
Did your friend do something bad? Why were they looking for them
Nice. Which one?
That should be fun.
oh_comma_ did you enjoy it? I love going to the beach
you miss your buddy_comma_ huh
I do. Makes me angry.
I do not like Krystals.
Did he have a weapon?
What were you gonna do if you caught him?
Oh no! Were there a lot of lines you had to remember?
Oh wow_comma_ thats impressive but I don't blame you for forgetting lines then since there were probably tons.
Wow! Have you looked to see how much it is worth? You could have some money.
You might want to talk to a financial adviser about it.
Did you find it?
I'm sure everyone has lost something. They're just probably glad it wasn't them.
That's awesome. Do you think you will get it?
Yes_comma_ definitely. Do you plan on buying anything new?
What did you think about?
glad to hear you had such a carefree childhood. do you have siblings?
That's terrible. Wh don't people just leave insteading of hurting their partner. I don't get it.
ME too. She wasn't the right one obviously. Sucks to have put in so much time though
I watched the first season.
What? It's ending? I heard he hasn't yet finished the books.
I agree. I love autumn.
I love Memphis.
It is a passing grade. I would be fine with it.
A guess an A would've been nice then since you worked so hard.
That's good. Preperation is the first step in having a good presentation.
Fingers crossed_comma_ I hope the presentation goes well.
That's exciting! Cabin sounds really cozy.
She's a lucky lady!
That's the worst_comma_ I know how that feels_comma_ I'm kind of being ghosted right now myself.
Just remember that means it was most likely for the best that she did ghost you_comma_ you wouldn't want to be with someone like that anyways.
Awww. Do you ever go back and visit?
Where is rou hometown?
I bet you are excited... are you bringing anything over with you? 
Sounds yummy! Thats a good choice. Have a great time. 
What kind of rock would you want to be?
So a dwayne rock.
/Did you get him a teacher?
I would be proud of him also.
You? I thought I was dreaming
Well_comma_ no use crying over silled milk I say.
I feel your pain_comma_ that happened to me a few years ago_comma_ I ended up having to settle on a job I didn't like just to make ends meet.
I hope you find a job_comma_ good luck!
I'm doing pretty alright_comma_ what about you?
Absolutely_comma_ it is one of my biggest pet peeves_comma_ especially when people accuse me of lying too.
I really wish I could NOT correlate to that.  But I can.  Me and my girlfriend are going through a weird time right now where she likes to tell me how hot other guys right to my face.  It is a terrible feeling_comma_ and I know exactly what you are talking about.  If it occurs a lot more I suggest you saying something about it_comma_ better to know the truth than dwell on it everytime.
Yea_comma_ recently I have been trying to decide whether or not I want to mute my girlfriend on social media or not_comma_ like not block her_comma_ just mute her.  Because it bothers me how she acts single on social media_comma_ and it confuses me as to whether she wants to be with me_comma_ or is just trying to live a different personality online.  Because she talks to me and is all lovey-dovey_comma_ then gets on social media and talks like "I don't need anyone" and talks about how hot guys are.  And it leaves me so stuck and with the worst anxiety.
Was your history test hard even after all the studying?
That's good_comma_ did you end up passing then?
Thats great. Where did you meet?
What did you eat?
Oh you were? I really am not a huge sports fan_comma_ so what was so big about this?
Never once? Damn_comma_ no wonder you were so shocked by it!
Yes_comma_ when does the season start?
That's exciting_comma_ who's your favorite team?
Do you regret it now that you are?
Why are you worried still?
oh no. How long has she been gone.
I hope not. My friends cat left for two weeks once. she came back hungry_comma_ but she was fine.
well I hope your cat returns safely.
you too
Can you do any work to it. I know there are a lot ideas on pinterest to perk up a place.
Keep on the lookout and talk to realtors. They usually hear of good places first
How was it?
Thats great. Where did you go.
I worry about that too occasionally_comma_ but I just push it to the back of my mind like usual.
I'm sure it won't be_comma_ most people die of old age around their friends and family in a peaceful way so just hope for that.
I am_comma_ I like the Oilers_comma_ who's your favorite team?
Nice_comma_ I hope they do well this season.
Oh_comma_ all kids are a little iffy_comma_ I think. Are you a teacher or do you mean your own children?
Teenagers are awful! I am really looking forward to my daughter becoming a teenager....not.
My mom put "the curse" on me. She said she hopes my daughter acted 10 times worse than I did. If that's the case_comma_ I need to start saving for boarding school_comma_ because I was awful!
Good luck!
So is it working now? I need atransmission for an old volvo. I'm saving for a new car instead.
Makes sense. I don't want any more bills until my kids are in school. Daycare is very expensive.
of course the 13 year old hates to babysit. I can't wait until she moves out. jk
This was the most fun chat Ive had today. Enjoy yur day!
What is HELLP? I'm sorry you and your baby had to go through that.
That's terrible. There are so many things to be afraid of when you're pregnant!
I absolutely hate car issues.  Will you be getting it fixed or buying another one?
Did it have any warranty when you bought it?
Why are you alone so much in the summer?
Do you have friends around? Go to a bar and meet some friends!
Was it as you remembered it?
That is amazing that it was not torn down or remodeled.  They seem to throw way too many buildings away these days.
I know that feeling too_comma_ at least somewhat. Seems like clear favoritism to me_comma_ but maybe I'm wrong.
That type of stuff always makes me so angry_comma_ since it's so clearly favoritism and hypocrisy and they just don't care one bit.
I like football_comma_ who are you talking about? what team?
Oh i see! are you excited with him? do you think they can go for the super bowl?
I know that feeling!  Are you involved in any political or activists groups?
Me neither.  But I agree with your sentiment - it is a great place to live and be a part of!
Yes. I do not have any kids myself.
Yes. Grandkids would be fun.
oh no. Did you get rid of the evidence?
who's cookies were they?
Do you study?
Thats good. Where do you go?
Interviews can be nerve wrecking.
I think if you stay calm you'll do fine.
Yikes_comma_ that must of been a bit scary. How did it go?
That's something at least. I hope they catch him.
Yeah_comma_ I have a friend who has gone through the same situation. She just wants whats best best for her kids. I hope things get better for you.
It shouldn't matter what you look like_comma_ but why would you think you are fat?
It doesn't mean you are fat or overweight. Everyone is different.
I watch it sometimes_comma_ It can be a little slow moving for my taste.
Are you from New York area. I'm a little farther south_comma_ but I do like them for sure. 
I hate jury duty.
Yes. They underpay.
Yes_comma_ so are you having nice weather_comma_or is it too dry and need some rain?
I see. Well_comma_ maybe the weather is calling for some in the near future? I like sunshine_comma_ but know we need some rain too_comma_ hope you get some soon.
oh no! that's scary! The house didn't get flooded_comma_ right?
i'm sorry to hear that!
That's actually so frustrating! No note left on your car or anything from the other driver?
Sorry to hear_comma_ I really hope that it doesn't cost to much to fix that up.
Oh no_comma_ that really sucks. That's awful that she wanted to end things_comma_ especially since you were really into her. I am sorry.
That's really odd_comma_ and unfortunate. Thankfully there are many more girls that would match you better :) Don't lose hope!
Thats sound nice. I went on vacation to Thailand last week. What did you do?
I know what that feels like. It must have been exciting! 
Acting as a 'mentor' in these situations is always fun and it makes the whole experience better!
Oh no_comma_ was it an important meal?
That's so sad!  What did you end up doing instead?
What went wrong with the pizza you were trying to make?
Yes airplanes make me feel queasy too. What do you do to cope with it?
I am sorry to hear that. Flying is never easy_comma_ especially when you feel that stressed
Who is she?
That is bad. Did you bought her a good present so she can forget about it?
That does sound scary! Were you okay?
Understandable_comma_ it must have been very unexpected!
That can be a fun time_comma_ it is nice to watch kids sometimes
I love playing video games_comma_ I am sure he really enjoyed that_comma_ even I would have!
Nice_comma_ I am glad to hear about that 
How old is he?
Wow_comma_ that's terrible. Why would he do that to you?
I'm sorry you're having to go through that_comma_ I hope you're able to sell the home for a better price.
That's just terrible. Some people really are ungrateful.
Well_comma_ hopefully he'll learn to be a better person someday_comma_ or eventually his actions will come back to haunt him.
I know that feel_comma_ my brother graduated a year ago_comma_ it's a really big milestone.
Yes I agree_comma_ it really signifies the start of their next chapter in life.
That must have been a burden lifted for sure!
That must have been a burden lifted for sure!
That's a shame_comma_ since rain is really nice to watch and hear even disregarding the dryness over there.
Very true_comma_ well hopefully you get some anyway! 
That's usually a sign of a lack of confidence or self esteem  in ones self I believe. 
I hope you he changes some so you can still be friends. 
that's wonderful! i've never cheated on my husband either
it is :( i don't know how is it possible to cheat on someone you love
I am sure you can_comma_ it just takes dedication and effort is all!
Then you should have no problems at all!
that is so scary! you didn't get hurt_comma_ right?
i'm so glad you did'nt get hurt
I was also excited. In fact_comma_ I have one right now!
Those are great titles. I am a big Nintendo fan. I can't wait for the new Metroid Prime.
That should be fun. Pokemon is a great franchise. I have many of the handheld games.
I have not_comma_ I did hear that England lost recently though.
I heard they were doing great before the loss though_comma_ hope you at least got to see them in some good matches.
Oh no_comma_ sorry to hear that! Were you okay?
I can imagine. Well atleast you can look back and laugh it off as one of 'those' days!
Did this make you excited?
What type of car was it?
I am sorry to hear that_comma_ maybe things will work themselves out!
I feel bad_comma_ I hope you find someone who treats you even better!
That sounds embarrassing_comma_ what happened after?
That sounds like what I would have done too
What a Jerk. Did you let him know he was being rude?
hat a Jerk. Did you let him know he was being rude?
you should let him know now.
I loved my grandparents on my mother's side _comma_ so I understand how you feel. 
I was very close to mine. They are like parents but more fun.
That is scary_comma_ what are you going to do about it?
Wow that is sad_comma_ I hope you get that fixed
That's fun_comma_ my friend is getting married next year_comma_ how big was the wedding?
Oh I see_comma_ well that's still nice!
That is very sad_comma_ did he ever get sober?
That is so great_comma_ I hope you have found some healing and closure to the difficulties it caused when you were younger. 
Wow_comma_ that's quite a move. Did he say why he's staying in Samoa so long?
I can understand that. It's hard to say goodbye to a friend_comma_ I hope you can stay in contact with him.
Oh man that's a bad situation. Was this vase of any sentimental value_comma_ or was it really expensive or what?
That might be a good idea_comma_ even if just to clear you conscience of the guilt.
Wow that is terrible_comma_ I hope he got to live a long life before that happened.
Thats terrible_comma_ at least he wasnt a puppy I guess.
I can imagine you would be_comma_ wouldnt want that to happen again.
Crazy they wont even eat vegetables but they will eat rat poison.
How did  he manage to do that?
I mean you said he barely passed it though. Must have been slim pickings when it came to giving out the sholarships.
What college did he end up going to?
Ah_comma_ yes_comma_ the lucrative writing career.
Did you get it done?
Oh_comma_ nicely done_comma_ thats impressive!
That is really awful. Did they take very much?
I bet that is a terrible feeling of betrayal. Friends should be more trustworthy. 
Oh no_comma_ did it end up okay?
I'm glad to hear it turned out okay.
Wow_comma_ it's a wounder you did not get killed!
Do you have any lasting damage? 
I was in a accident years ago and found glass coming out of my scalp for weeks. So I know how it is.
It would have been easier to room with your brother isntead of a random roomate _comma_I bet.
Strange they ask you to pay for college_comma_ but offer few choices.
That's great! That time with the kids will really be worth it_comma_ ultimately.
Yeah_comma_ it's a good thing that you have a lot of time for other more important things now.
I did too_comma_ honestly. I have really improved them myself_comma_ good to hear that you have too.
Although I still deal with stress occasionally_comma_ I know exactly what you mean. 
Why were you nervous about it? Usually drinking means to loosen up and have fun.
I can see that_comma_ i had my first beer at 13 due to my brother but knew it was wrong at my age.
I totally understand. But I guess as a friend you also have to be happy for him and one day you will get your happiness too
Remember that the universe has a perfect timing for everything. Being with someone isn't everything_comma_ be comfortable and enjoy your own company and love will come when you least expect it :) 
I bet so. I've never done anything like that before.
That is surprising. Usually these things are a popularity contest.
I would not_comma_ they have to learn at some point!
I get that_comma_ but it was bound to happn at some point
You must have been thrilled! There is nothing like a first car. Did you love it?
No way -- THAT'S the best. Paid for (I'm assuming) *and* running. Do you hope to do the same for your kids when it's time?
Damn_comma_ I wish I had a car myself. What was the occasion?
Cool_comma_ 16th birthday or what?
what did you do?
that was the right move!
That's impressive_comma_ sounds like a smart young man.
Sounds like it_comma_ Good for you guys!
Ahh yes_comma_  must have been a very nice surprise! Did you play Mario on it?
Well thats one way to get your kids to do household chores!
What athletics did you participate in?
Man i know that feeling. But sounds like you worked hard.
When did he graduate? Sounds like a really cool moment to share with him.
I graduated that year too! Cool to see that you were as excited as he likely was.
I am very sorry to hear that_comma_ that must be terrible....
I undertand that. People are crazy like that_comma_ I never understood it
That is something I want to do when I get older_comma_ I miss the golden days!
I bet it was_comma_ to catch up after awhile_comma_ few things really compare
That's tragic_comma_ I haven't had to deal with anything like that yet.
I hope so too_comma_ and I hope that you don't have to deal with anything like that anytime soon.
So your saying your faithful and love her.
Sounds like you got your priorities straight good man.
Wow_comma_ go you! I am proud of you_comma_ it can be tough to do!
That is what matters_comma_ best of luck using it friend!
That is an amazing thing. Being cheated on is one of the worst things that can happen when ones enters a bond like a relationship.
I am sure that you two will have a happy and loving life together especially if she reciprocates your desire to never cheat. 
How exciting_comma_ are you from France?
When did she move out there?
Great. How long did you stop working out?
It is always good to work out but start slowly since it has been a long time since your last work out.
Was the person one of those one people who goes like 5 miles an hour in a 65?
The question is_comma_ did the woman at least do a good job ( from what you could see)?
How did you respond after rejection?
Yes_comma_ you hear stories all of the time about people being rejected to find out that it was a blessing in disguise
I am sorry to hear that_comma_ I hope things turn around for you soon!
I am glad to hear that_comma_ I hope they work out for you!
HaHa What kind of food did they leave for you? Did you say anything to them?
LOL It really shouldn't be funny but for some reason you are making me laugh! I guess that will teach them to leave their lunch sitting around! haha
omg congratulations! Thats a great achievement and must give you so much pride and motication for the future
All the best for your future and your role aswell! 
You are right.Florida is a big state with lot's of people.
The odds must be astronomical_comma_ almost like winning the lottery.
I am shocked too_comma_ Croatia only has 4 millio people
Yeaah they really were_comma_ number 12 killed it with that goal 
I feel that man_comma_ Parents like that care for their family a lot.
I am in that boat at times where i live.
I know that feeling_comma_ good for you!
Yes_comma_ those are awesome feelings_comma_ I crave that all the time
well he did have a right to be angry (depending on how you broke it ofc)
oh darn thats just abit rude and unnecessary. I hope everything is ok now 
I am glad to hear that_comma_ did you repay him?
That is good to hear_comma_ I am glad it worked out well instead of a disaster
sibling fights worth living for.. I wish  i had one.
you would know better hehe!!
Well happy early birthday! I hope you have a great day!
I bet_comma_ I hope you get everything you want!
Sorry to hear that. Do you have more firends now?
Great.
Good job! I am sure that took a lot of hard work!
I am sure that was stressful that whole time
Me to. I also play gameboy from time to time
I do not have mine.I bought one on EBAY and also 12 games just to remember the past
That is so aggravating! I've been in the exact same situation. I hope you weren't hurt.
Good to hear you were all right. Hopefully insurance covered your car -- though I know nothing makes up for the time spent dealing with the situation!
I believe this kind of a rude attitude by parents leave an impression on the kid's growth
True_comma_ I have a close friend who's quite young now and he seems to have scary thoughts about his childhood days
I wish I could afford lessons or to even try_comma_ I bet it is really fun!
I do like to watch it in the olympics or sure though!
I like them too. I like to play football games while I'm eating Chik-Fil-A_comma_ but I always want to go on Sundays when they're closed.
I never think about it during the week_comma_ the craving always hits me on Sunday. It's very disheartening when you pull up and the place is completely empty.
That sounds like fun! What are you planning to do at the lake.
It will be a great escape from regular life_comma_ right? How often do you get to go?
Oh that's nice_comma_ you must have a hard-working husband.
That sounds horrible. Was it serious?
That sounds like fun! Was it your first time at Universal? 
I can imagine! Were there any other memorable aspects of the visit? 
Those are both admirable ideas. How are you trying to improve trust?
Travel agents make complicated travel so much easier than using online sites. 
That's awesome. Best of luck to you with your business! 
I'm sorry to hear that! Happy Birthday! Hope you didn't eat the entire cake LOL!
I decided not to celebrate birthdays anymore now that I'm old!
Maybe next year will be better! 
Oh my goodness! That must have been frightening. What happened after it alerted?
Where did the snake go?
That is awesome! I bet you had a great time!
Weight loss can be so liberating! I'm glad you were able to enjoy yourself.
That's awesome. Is she better?
That's scary! How old is she?
Same. It is just a devasting thing that is happening. 
That is true. But this is basic humanity you know. Surely there is another way 
When what happened?
What was the issue that plagued you?
Damn_comma_ that sucks. What field do you work in?
Why did he get the promotion over you?
That's such a nice gift! What are your main uses of it? 
I've heard great things about Reddit but have never actually signed up myself!
That's not good at all. Did you lose any important data?
I would be too! That sounds like a real inconvenience. 
I will send all the good vibes! Is it in a field you could see yourself making a career of?
Always_comma_ it is. And it sounds empty to say "it will all work out for the best"....but it will! In the meantime_comma_ are you applying/interviewing for other positions?
What is it about their style of play that you're not a fan of?
I see where you're coming from. 
I'm not too familiar with Tennis_comma_ Is he known to be a winner? 
Wow that's neat! Crazy to hear he lost then as you said.
What exciting news! Did you find out ahead of time what the gender of the baby was?
What is 2000 yen equal to in U.S. currency?
It sure sounds like it. I think healthcare in Japan is much more affordable that here in America_comma_ do you agree?
Oh_comma_ okay_comma_ well I watched a documentary about healthcare in other countries. I understand that doesn't apply here.
Moms are good at doing that_comma_ aren't they?  What did she do for you?
I know that feeling! What's been getting to you?
I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope you make a speedy recovery!
yes_comma_ especially if you travel a lot and for a long time. Is it for work?
Where do you go the most?
That is nice! I wish I can go to those countries
Wow ! that sound's really awesome. I wish I could have gone there. But surely not for work !
I wish you all the best pal ! You will surely rock !
Maybe something in your life  makes you very stress. You should try to relax before go to sleep.
You konw_comma_ sometimes consulting  a psy is a good investment. Dont be afraid to do that.
That sounds very sad. I am very sorry to hear you experienced that. 
Huh_comma_ I see. Well good for him!
What happened?
Oh_comma_ no. That's awful! Did you report something that had occurred at your job? 
Yeah_comma_ that's good. It's hard to know whether to blow the whistle sometimes. It could always come back for you. I'm glad that it sounds like it worked out.
Yeah_comma_ navigating those sorts of things is treacherous_comma_ but as long as you know you're doing the right thing_comma_ that's all you can do. 
That can be pretty hard to swallow_comma_ do you stay in touch? It's easier these days with the likes of social media. How do you fill that void?
That's such a shame_comma_ we grieve any kind of loss_comma_ I suppose. Perhaps the wedding would bring you closer together?
I hope it works out for you_comma_ life is too short. Fill your life with wonderful things and wonderful things will surely happen.
I'm not actually much of a soccer fan but the hype is hard to escape! 
Yes_comma_ I'm aware_comma_ but i'm a much bigger hockey fan. 
I stand behind him. Compared to the rest of the world we are to easy on illegal immigrants and this is coming from a Mexican American. 
How so because I want everyone in this place to be safe? You need to google immigration in other parts of the world and you will realize how awesome it is here.
It's sad that you have such a small mind.
It does happen sometimes. Has it ever occurred to you?
You must have felt terribly guilty when you realized! Happens to all of us
Brain just wants to work against you?
I would get that a lot in school back in the day i feel it's pretty normal to have those moments.
Oh_comma_ man. That's rough. I'm sorry. Are friends helping?
Friends I know who have been through rough breakups often say that physical activity helps. That_comma_ and time. But still -- it's difficult!
Holy smokes - thats unbelievable.  I gave up on playing those scratch off games
How often do you play?
Were you using it to get to a specific place?
I hope you were able to get it turned right back on in order to have directions to get where you were going.
I am hopeful as well_comma_ but because we are human beings_comma_ I doubt that will ever happen. There will always be the same old squabbles that have occurred since the dawn of man.
Yeah_comma_ sadly our world leaders are too focused on "flexing" instead of working towards creating a world that is sustainable and liveable for our grandchildren's children
That's sad. Sorry you had to go through that.
I would have peed in my pants if i was there.
How do you feel now after so long being there?
That is a great feeling i bet! Good job man!
That must have been terrible. Were you okay?
I can imagine it must have been very distressing. Glad that you were OK.
Yes_comma_ many. Would you like to tell me about it?
Surely you were able to explain that this was out of your control.
That is terrible.  Were you able to do anything about it?
Did you speak to a counselor_comma_ priest_comma_ or family member about it?
That is terrible. Did you feel lonely?
How long did you stay alone?
That is pretty great! I am actually still a beginner with snowboarding.
I feel for me it's just getting to the slopes more often too.
True ! Conventions give you an opportunity to learn as you never know what kind of situations will prop up
Do you have a professional degree in first aid?
Texas does that to us! It helps we live in a place where air conditioning is the norm. Or do you like spending time out in the heat?
I know what you mean. It's like you have to dress for both the outside *and* the inside. That's great you have a pool in which to escape_comma_ though! 
Oh no! Hopefully renters insurance covered it!
Well that is terrible for him but I am glad at least some of it is being taken care of!
Ugg I am sorry to hear that. Sometimes dealing with land lords is a tough business.
Were they fond memories?
That's understandable. I hope everyone you know is doing well from back then!
Oh wow that sounds awful! was it graphic?
I'm so sorry you had to go through that.
Sorry to hear about that. Did you ask him to move out of the house?
Did you know the person who was with him?
What song was it? Did you know it?
Man that is crazy! Especially that song!
I consider myself somewhat knowledgable about them too_comma_ it's very fulfilling being able to help other people with their problems sometimes.
Yeah_comma_ sometimes it can be annoying though because they come to you with really easy problems to fix and you feel like they should know how to do it themselves.
Did you take that chance and redo it?
I hope the email will bring you good news
I know that pain!  Did he keep you up watching tv or video games?
Because mine does the same thing... If its not video games its the TV on full blast haha! Tell him you need your beauty sleep.
So have you gotten to open it yet??
Wow! I would have told her to fill out the paperwork herself getting your hopes up like that.
Oh no!  Well what he didn't know won't hurt him.  Hopefully you can get a replacement.
Awww well I am glad he was understanding about it.
Thats unfortunate. It is a difficult decision to make. Sometimes we are put in those situations and they take a toll on us.
I hope he is in a better place now. How did you have Blackjack for?
So you all had relatively all his life. Yes_comma_ it was the right thing to do. Did you get another pet instead?
Wow! You must have a very trusting face! That was very nice of you to help her.
It definitely was! How old do you think her kids were?
I almost don't want to talk about it_comma_ you know? Are you doing anything to try to move from a place of fear to one of preparation or opportunity?
Good for you. And I hope you have moments of joy while you prepare for that?
Did you play it?
That sounds so fun! I"m glad you enjoyed it!
I imagine that made you feel empathetic to his plight.
Please tell me that you gave him some money to help him out.
That's unfortunate. Do you like her?
I am sorry. Did you set up another day to hang out?
What did you and your friends do on that day?
That does sound fun! Was the food good?
Oh no_comma_ did you report it to the police?
I have some hot chocolate that can help calm you down a bit.
No! THAT is painful! He must have felt awful! Did he have insurance to cover anything?
I am so sorry! But he does sound like a true friend if he's actively paying you back!
That is exciting when your team wins_comma_ have you always been a hockey fan?
That is awesome! I am from Chicago_comma_ so when the cubs won the world series I felt the same way. 
I bet! always good when new life is born.
Oh that must be a handful for your parents.
I am sorry to hear that.I hope she gets better.
That is horrible news.Your family should make sure she gets comfortable on her last moments.
Wow I did not know that!
Oh no. Were you upset as well?
Of course! I'm human! ;-) Beyond the disappointments_comma_ I think it's how we respond that defines us_comma_ you know?
Probably even harder! Is there another fellowship you have your eye on?
Oh_comma_ sending you all the best vibes! And congratulations ahead of time_comma_ Doctor!
Oh really? How did that make you feel_comma_ honestly?
I can imagine. The unknown can be very scary and make you worry.
Oh no!  Was it a first date?  Or had you been out with this person before?
That's so sweet.  Do you laugh about the situation now together?
That's really awesome_comma_ what makes it so complex?
Well that's really great that you were able to prepare so much_comma_ obviously you know what you're doing! Do you usually have to prep so much?
Aww! That's so sweet! How long have you been married?
That's very exciting! Congratulations on your raise!
Please tell me you caught him!! That is awful!!
You almost gave me a heart attack with that story!!
That was very nice of them. Was it for a special occasion?
Well_comma_ now you know they do! That was very thoughtful of them.
Where did you see it? 
I bet_comma_ what did it look like?
What made it so difficult?
Did you tell the teacher then we know atleast you had tried.
Wonderful! Your team I guess? That's exciting!
It's great you give them the respect for that_comma_ your team or not! When is the Final?
What is it about?
Sounds like you will likely do well.  Do you expect any problems with other people?
That's so sweet and fortunate that she was able to do that for you. I wish I could do that.
You're right_comma_ and I do all of the time. What kind of car did you get?
I remember those cars! How long did it last you?
That is such a stressful thing to come home to!
I am so sorry you had to go through that!
Oh how nice! Did you get to visit with friends and family?
I'll bet. It's always nice to visit_comma_ but it can be hard to say goodbye.
You still remember what you got for it?  It must have been memorable!  What was it?
Oh I know that feeling!  My family was the same way_comma_ and I still remember coming home after my last day of 6th grade and seeing that same SNES box sitting on my bed.
Oh wow_comma_ what time did you end up getting to bed?
I know the feeling too well! Hopefully you get a good's night rest tonight. 
You shouldn't think about death! Take each day as it comes
Thinking like that seems stressful
Life is like that.  It is not what you know but who you know.
No need to kiss butt.  Maintain your integrity and enjoy life on it's terms.
What battle? What were you doing?
Is that a video game?
That's never fun.  Did you have any notes to help you remember?
That wasn't very nice of them.  It's quite common to forget things.  Hopefully next time you remember!
Wow_comma_ I'm sure it will work. I've very hopeful for you.
My wife and I have been together for 12 years_comma_ tried years ago and nothing. Waited a while and then started trying again and we got it. Fate has a funny way of working out.
That is great. With who are you going?
That is great.
Wow. What do you think will happen?
Well make sure you listen to your Dr.'s advice!
Congratulations!!! That can be both exciting and terrifying? Where are you on that spectrum? ;-)
I am sending you all the best vibes. Is it in a field you've worked in before?
Happily_comma_ a lot of employers seem to be willing to extrapolate that if you had talents in one industry_comma_ they'd apply to another. You can always learn about different subjects; you can't always learn how to bring that special spark that customer service needs. Best of luck!
I've been in that boat. What do you think the issue was?
That stinks. I've been interviewing also. I had two places call me back for three interviews and then no offer. So I feel ya. Just keep looking.
how did that go? 
Was it a long move? 
Why didn't you have any friends? 
What games did you play at the time?
Sorry to hear that_comma_ what happened? 
That's awful_comma_ people need to be more careful
Did you tell him_comma_ or did he find out?
Awe_comma_ I am sorry. In those instances_comma_ nobody wins. I hope you guys came out of it stronger than before
what was the team activity? 
I'm happy it went well for you!
What is your health issue?
Sorry to hear that. I have same issues with my knees.
Oh no_comma_ were you able to tell her you did it?
Ugh_comma_ I'm sure that was hard.  I'm sorry you had to go through that.
I SO agree. I would not want to live like that. And it's one thing if they're only affecting themselves -- but when it's aimed at others -- the worst.
Isn't that weird? I mean it takes *energy* to be that negative! Does your brother feel that too? Or just can't/won't see it?
How is she feeling?
That's terrific. Hopefully she continues to get better and better. 
How did that make you feel
Did you confront him
OH I am sorry to hear that. How?
Oh no! I hope you can fix it!
I remember those days_comma_ what subject?
It sounds hard! What grade did you get?
I have the same feeling but for the last 90s and early 2000's. Being an adult is no fun.
Yes or rich. When I was a kid I wanted to grow up. Now that I'm old I want to be a kid again.
Did you decline? I would not feel very comfortable until i got to know the family. 
I agree_comma_ you made the right choice. And it gives you time to get to know the hosts before a future sleepover!
Oh_comma_ well that isn't fair of your boss! Most people wouldn't work at all while are maternity leave_comma_ he should be grateful!
Well_comma_ sounds like your boss is stressed out too much and taking it out on you! Maybe he needs a long break!
Do you mean LeBron James? I was hoping he'd come to Miami!
I wish he would have! The Heat can use his help! Haha!
That must've been awesome.  I've only been to one NFL game and it was wild!
I can imagine!  I remember finding out I got free tickets to Disney World one time_comma_ I was ecstatic.
Wow I am so sorry. That had to be so scary.  Were the cops able to find any evidence?
man I was hoping they would be able to help in some way!  I hope they didn't take anything to personal!
How sweet! How old are they now?
This is true for me as well_comma_ I have a 17 and 19 years old. I can't believe it_comma_ and just turned 40 on the 5th.
That's..intriguing. Is there any particular reason why you're scared of the ocean?
Really? Same..I was about 5 in the deep end by myself.  How old were you?
I do not like OkCupid.
I prefer Tinder.
I wish i was Chris Pratt but why do you wanna be "The Pitt"
This is very true_comma_ But would you want to be bugged by people all the time.
I love Pokemon.
Cool. I liked Pokemon blue.
Why do you fail? Do you not study?
No one is smart until they learn to be smart. We are all born with brains but not smarts. We must gain smarts.
You can be the next trump if you work hard.
You have to work hard and get good at somehting.
I'm sorry to hear that. You two were close?
I did the same with mine. I lived with her during the summers and went home when school started back.
Hey_comma_ it happens sometimes. What was the situation?
Trust me I've been there! Some days are better than others. Did you apologize?
I know that must have been so disappointing!
Well there will always be other chances for this match up to play out again.
I'm sorry to hear that.  It must be difficult to be away from the one you love.
I'm glad to hear that.  I wish you continued love and success with your marriage.  It's a rare gift to have these days.
Does he have good characteristics too_comma_ or is he just annoying all the time?
Does he at least have interesting things to say when he talks?
Sorry to hear that.  Do you play soccer
Oh cool.  Maybe he was more of a hockey fan
How long have you been playing
Yeah when you break that fear from asking life gets A LOT better.
I am a male so it was hard at first to do that since most girls do want some assertive guys.
I'm sure you had a good reason. What was it about?
Why would you lie about that? It couldn't have been that bad? 
I love family reunions.
Thats great. Where did you meet?
That's great. Where did you meet?
What song was it?
I've never heard of it_comma_ is it from the 80's?
I have a Xbox 360.
I love Madden.
Cool. What makes you so confident
Nice. gotta love easy credit when you put in the work
He is cool. I would settle for a British butler. Is he your favorite super hero?
I really like Batman too_comma_ Christian Bale is my favorite Batman. 
So exciting! Where are you going again?
Whoa! That's incredible! I've never even been out of the country. Who are you going with again?
I agree completely.
Where did you meet her?
The movie or Information Technology?
I liked it a lot too_comma_ Can't wait for the next part of it.
Me too! When do you start school?
August as well.  What are you studying?
What did he do?
Did you try to bribe him?
What did he buy you?
I have an iphone7.
I've heard his net worth is like $20.9 billion dollars!!  I wish I was him too - LOL!
If I were to travel to Mars_comma_ it would be with him!
I can totally relate. Dogs are better than most people. What kid of dog was it?
I'm sorry. Dogs take a piece of our hearts when they go. 18 years is a very long life for a dog_comma_ I bet you had a lot of great times together!
Wow_comma_ you are strong.
What do you eat to be so strong?
That's cool.  I'm still a Boston boy...lived in Lowell_comma_ MA in 4-5th grade
No I want to though.  Did you score tickets or something
Oh_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that. Did you stay in the capital?
Oh no! Next time_comma_ make sure you go to Mexico City! It's a blast! Besides_comma_ Cozumel isn't really that dangerous at all.
That's great! It's important to have confidence in yourself and your abilities at work to be successful. It's a good example to set for your coworkers too!
Well_comma_ that's the most important one to make sure is happy! Good for you!
I can relate - we've been in our house 18 years and have yet to do anything.  What style are you doing it in?
I bet you are having a blast!!!  How long do you think the renovations will take until you are done?
Oh_comma_ that's terrible!! What is HELLP syndrome?
Thank goodness she was able to come_comma_ but that must have been so scary! I hope you're okay now!
I've been there when a new company bought us out. How did you handle it? 
That sounds stressful. At least they offered severance.
Emotions run high - we all say things we don't mean. What happened?
Honestly_comma_ you got to pick one or the other. I can see how you were frustrated_comma_ but I'm glad you realize you shouldn't have yelled.
Why is that? Is there something wrong with you?
You should work on that.Be a better version of yourself.
I love Donald Trump.
No_comma_ he lowered my taxes.
My husband has that issue.  Are you shorter than average?
I've heard of people trying to hang upside down for hours a day to lengthen themselves.  Not that I think it works_comma_ but apparently many people would like to be taller.
That isn't cool. Are you ok?
That is mean. Girls can be mean sometimes.
That's understandable was it strong? 
Wow_comma_ impressive. Was it your first? 
really?? I could not care less.
I am more like a rock and roll type of guy myself.
Where does she work?
Thats cool. I went to school for marketing.
What score did they get?
Yes. I wouldn't go back.
He does?! So exciting! What team does he play for?
They are doing really well this season! You must be so proud!
That must have been stressful. Did you report it?
Are they going to accept responsibility and buy you new items? 
Oh man that sucks...I'd be really embarrassed
Sorry to here that.  Just curious are you male or female
I am a male.
I am Filipino also.
Oh_comma_ I'm so sorry to hear that! I know how hard that can be for the family as well. Is he able to get treatments?
Well_comma_ I can't relate to some extent. My father passed away 2 years unexpectedly. It wasn't from cancer_comma_ and we actually never thought he was going to pass away that day when he went to the hospital. But_comma_ it's very hard to lose loved ones!
yes_comma_ I love new gadgets.Specially from the Apple store.
I remember also playing games with old and slow computers when i was a teenager.
Was it the summer flu? Heard that went around a lot.
That just sounds so bad. Glad she is better now!
Why? You should be happy with who you are.
Height you can not change but if you work hard anyone can be rich. 
Just work hard and make your own money. 
I'm sure you will. Have you been training? 
Do you think that's enough?
I'm so sorry. That must have been so painful for you. Were you close?
My heart hurts for you. That's such a terrible loss.
Is it ok?
I do not like salesman.
I don't think there is anything wrong with average. 
We are all average until circumstances require us to be extraordinary. 
I saw that movie a long time ago.
What was your favorite part
Cool_comma_ I guess she was strong.
Do you have any kids?
I do not_comma_ how about you?
Thats cool_comma_ what kind of camera do you have?
That is an awesome achievement! Was it for high school or college?
I never played any sports in high school_comma_ I always had to work. That is a great accomplishment!
Yikes_comma_ door guy can't catch a break. Is he ok?
Wow_comma_ thank god he's on the up and up. I can't imagine how rough that must have been.
Man I feel you.  Today was her birthday..but I thought it would be awkward to go over since she blocked me on facebook
Where are you from originally.  I'm Filipino
I have not and don't want to.
I do like a good sandwich thou. But I eat slow.
Awe_comma_ I am sorry for your loss. Was it sudden?
I am sorry for the loss. Are you okay?
Was it pretty close?
Bummer.  Haven't seen it.  Don't watch soccer but I respect the sport
Wow_comma_ you are lucky you did not die.
Did someone save you?
Why? She seems to be nice person
Oh I didn't know about that. How she is able to steal money?
That is great.
Hopefully it will work out.
Good for you.What is the reason of all this happiness?
You choose the best time.The summer is perfect for beaches.
Yes. They should of won.
Yes but the choked like usual.
I would be as well if I were you. Are you from the area?
wasn't Johnny Manziel susposed to save that team?
I'm not a big fan of them either.  Are you able to go up in buildings with an elevator_comma_ etc..?
Has it ever caused you to not be able to enjoy certain things in life?
Were the results good or bad?
Yes I am sure it was.
aww he must be adorable.
hahah how old is he?!
Oh_comma_ that is exciting. How big is your house?
Oh_comma_ that sounds nice. What's your occupation?
Wow that's pretty bad parenting.
Is it for religious reasons
Hindsight and all that - do you miss her?
Perhaps she may forgive you?  It's always worth a try_comma_ sometimes you just need some time and some growth before you can revisit mistakes that have happened.
What are your plans?
Wow_comma_ that sounds like a fun and interesting time_comma_ but it sounds like there are a high chance for things to go south and be a huge mess
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. How deid it happen?
Are you going to sue? You could get a whole new leg!
How much would you like to lose?
Sounds like a plan! You can also try to see if there is less calorie version of foods you like.
I know how that can be such a struggle.  How long has it been and why did it end?
Everyone makes mistakes_comma_ we live and learn I guess.  If there is no hope of her taking you back_comma_ then you have to find a way to move forward_comma_ but take the time you need to grieve as it is a loss.
Nice! Does he feel pretty confident about it
Awesome! Glad it worked out for him
Yes I have actually. It was scary.
Im so sorry to hear that. I was watching a house for a familty member and they're safe was stolen.
I love the beach_comma_ the gulf is my favorite!
The Atlantic is not so bad!
Sorry to hear that.  My grandmother is all I have left. Grandpa passed 1 month ago
How old are your daughters
Wow - were you nervous or scared at all?  Did the police get involved?
Oh no!  Did you have to go to the hospital to get stitches or anything like that?
That is fun! What was it?
What a neat mystery. I bet you wish you could thank them though. 
Oh no I'm sorry about that_comma_ do you have any family that can help?
Do you have any leads on any new jobs?
Oh no. Did you talk it out with them?
That's nice. Everyone makes mistakes. Glad he was forgiving!
That was noble
I guess when you do that well in school_comma_ you can afford to miss a day because of that every once and awhile
That is an awesome dad. Do you still have the truck?
A decade is great use of it. Do you miss it?
Oh_comma_ that is SO hard. It sounds like she had a long and happy life. I'm sure you miss her so much.
What kind of dog was she? 
Oh no! Is she okay?
That's good to hear! How long ago was that?
So I take it you are a soccer fan?  It seems America is finally getting into the sport.  Do you play yourself?
I would imagine so!  Argentina seems like a lovely place to live.
Oh_comma_ wao those a terrible news_comma_ is there any way to keep the house?
Well_comma_ you have to weight your financial situation vs your emotional situation and see if it worth to keep the house_comma_ i guess you have so many memories there.
ALL of y'all must have been so scared! Was she okay? Any stitches necessary?
The vomiting is scary -- so good that y'all got to the ER_comma_ and could confirm that she was okay. Was she fearful of stairs after that?
I'm glad you had someone to take care of it while you were away. Was you mother alright?
Oh no. Were you able to get things sorted out? We live far away from family and I know how hard it can be especially when there are health concerns. 
Ah_comma_ congratulations! What a GREAT feeling. Are y'all all still good friends?
You know what_comma_ nothing to mourn_comma_ really. Life has chapters_comma_ you know? It's wonderful you have the memories you do.
I watched a movie based off a true story on that once. It was truely a sad story for the little girl and her parents.
It was a korean movie. Don't recall the name.
That's pretty sympathetic of you...but aren't you worried they'll start going through your trash
Do you own any cats or dogs
Wow_comma_ I'll bet you're ready for a vacation. Are you going anywhere special?
That should be awesome. Do you know anyone in Canada?
It sounds beautiful and serene.
No I haven't. But now I want to see.
What an amazing gift to be given!  That truly sounds like a blessing for you.
For sure!  Did you accept the gift?
I'm glad you and your husband communicate enough to know that!
What do you say to your kids to deal with it?
Thats awesome_comma_ congratulations for sure
I am sure you are both going to be happy
Wow. What a mature teacher.
Was the fire related to the incident or did she get in trouble for something else?
That is great! Have you been looking for a job for long?
I bet it is a good feeling and are looking forward to hearing from them. 
Sorry to hear about your other ones...What breed is the new one
Haha nice never a dull moment I bet
Was he okay with the happy meal?
That's good to hear!
Oh_comma_ no! I;m sorry to hear that. Is this normal for your friend.
I hope that you hear from him soon! 
Oh no. I'm so sorry to hear that.
You sound really mature about it. Can't say that about a lot of people.
I am sure you will do well_comma_ it isnt too hard
No problem_comma_ it will be worth it in the end
People make stupid mistakes. How long ago was this?
Oh wow. 10 years is a long time to hold onto something.
That's good to hear_comma_ it's inspiring to see humans support each other in times of need I think.
Wow they sound like nice people to me_comma_ I hope their insurance is in order so they can be comfortable again soon.
That's a good friend. Did you have a good time?
I'm glad you had a great time. How long have you guys been friends?
Cool_comma_ want kind of music will the competition have?
That sounds like fun.  I like all kinds of music too.  What is your favorite?
Oh no. I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope things get better for him soon.
Kids grow up so fast. Will your son be going to college locally or away?
Did you ask why it took so long to get a raise?
Oh wow_comma_ you shouldn't have to be afraid but it is good you finally got that raise!
How did that make you feel?
Oh no. Do you think about breaking off the friendship?
I am sorry_comma_ kids can be mean
Some people do not need to be in charge when it comes to school_comma_ they are truly worthless sometimes
Awww!  What movie did you go to see?
I love Jim Carrey!  I bet ya'll had a great time.
Oh that sucks.  Did anyone see it
Nice.  Hate when that happens
WOW that is super scary! are you ok?
Sometimes i keep a extra pir of underwear in my car for this occasion.
Me too_comma_ I haven't really found a good strategy to avoid the nervousness to be honest.
Yeah the more you think about it the more you let your expectations and imaginations put fear into you_comma_ guess we have to avoid doing that somehow.
Oh man_comma_ I accidentally eat cake all the time! It is too hard to resist. What did your mom do?
That is not too bad. What kind of cake was it?
Wow. The DMV is just dreadful to go to because of stuff like that.
Yea_comma_ it would be! How faw is your DMV?
Wow_comma_ that is awesome! Bet you were shocked and happy at the same time!
I bet! Especially with the cost of college these days!
Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. Was he adopted?
Oh no. Poor guy. I hope he'll be happy with the man.
Oh nice did you have fun? What lake?
What did you guys do there today? Go swimming or fishing?
The DMV really should be better by now. Did you get a chance to do anything during the wait?
Wow. Just one inconveniece after another. It's no wonder people dread having to deal with the DMV.
Awesome! It seems like you really worked hard_comma_ what type of work do you do?
Oh_comma_ yeah. I couldn't do that type of work. It is too stressful for me.
That is so hard_comma_ to feel like you've been looked over. Have you been able to have conversations with leadership as to why that might be the case?
Does that make you curious to look elsewhere? It sounds like it's maybe not the best place?
Oh no.  What happened?
Wow.  It had that much of an effect on you?  That it made you consider your own mortality?
Well it's good to remember your mortality_comma_ even if you have to ignore it to continue normal life.
i am so sorry for you.  I know what a crushing experience the passing of a beloved pet can be.  You must be very sad.
That is awful.  An unexpected illness cam really strike like a dagger in the heart.
What concert?  Did you like her enough to go on a 2nd date?
Well_comma_ that sounds a bit scary!  What happened?
Did he pass away or not live close to you?
I'm so sorry_comma_ it's hard when anyone close passes on_comma_ but I think parents are one of the hardest.
Why did you decide to change their education?
that is an important steep you are taking in your life.
How come?
That's a tough decision to make_comma_ but children do need someone at that young an age.
How do you feel about that?
That is a tough situation. You don't want to mess up a great friendship and you also don't want to hurt her feelings either if you don't feel the same. 
Why are you jealous of Eric?
I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ I know what it's like to have your love stolen from you.
If that's the case then you have a chance to find a better woman!
Maybe he has no respect for you.
Have you try talk to him about those issues.If he likes you he should work on the relationship.
Awesome! What type of promotion? Did you get a raise too?
Congrats for what store or company? Did you get a raise too?
Uhmmnnn_comma_that could have been really emotional for you
I understand_comma_ I've been there too_comma_hope your getting through?
I understand that all too well
My oldest only has 3 years to go and I already have dogs! I guess I'll need more
Wow that really old but not too old for mummies considering.
Haha yea seems like it would be really cool to see in person.
What did your friend say?
Did you buy him more food?
That's good. It sounds like a happy ending.
That must have been very frightening. Did you have somewhere safe that you went to>
What are the chances of that?! How strange_comma_ but lucky for you.
What is happening on Sunday?
Who are you pulling for? 
It's always good to see an underdog win!
What is happening in February?
Good for you.You are going to have the time of your life.
I'm really sorry to hear that. When did she pass away?
I'm sure with time the pain will pass. Try to stay positive!
Oh my! That is so scary. Thank goodness you are ok. Was it the Uber driver's fault?
Absolutely. Knock on wood_comma_ I've still never been in a car crash. Make sure you go to the doctor if you have any pain over the next couple of days.
Where do you live? I live in Missouri and the snows can be brutal. We had a couple days at 0F this year. I hate it
I heard about that on the news_comma_ how it was rare to see that. I LOVE Georgia. My favorite place to visit is Savannah. I will gladly trade spots with you.
My day was pretty good. I got to work from home and pack for my trip this weekend.
I am going to Cali to see all of the national parks.
I plan to go to both of those parks plus Lake Tahoe and Las Vegas. I have never been to Vegas.
that's pretty cool.  what breed?
Well you picked a great one :) Love labs.  My friend's got a big one he just attacks me with love everytime I see him
That really sucks. I hate it when people spoil shows!
Sometimes you just got to binge on your own_comma_ lol!
Oh no.. that sounds awful. What happened next?
That is ridiculous. No one should treat you like that when you're seeking medical help.
Oh that is scary_comma_ that happened to us a couple months ago!
I suppose find the safest spot to bunker down_comma_ it's hard not to panic though
I completely understand. I stay home with my four kids and wouldn't have it any other way. 
Yeah_comma_ I do them all here too_comma_ they are never ending. 
Yes it is :) 
Interesting! Did you apprehend him?
I could imagine the experience. That was a wise thing you did!
I cant actually see what you put in the prompt_comma_ but man thats crazy if it was a ferrari.
I love Ferraris_comma_ they are so expensive though_comma_ one day I hope to own one.
Me too_comma_ how does Christmas in July work?
Maybe keep it simple_comma_ and do different things each year. Last year we went on vacation.
Awesome! What are you studying?
Curves are always a good thing! I was always thankful for them.
Oh yeah? What's so special about it?
Wow! That sounds like such a fun time
Never had children as in infertile or a bad person?
Thats terrible_comma_ I hope they grow up fine_comma_ would be horrid if they didnt.
Oh no_comma_ are you ok?
I can imagine_comma_ perhaps it's a good way to get someone to fix the steps?
I am sorry to hear about that. What happened?
I hope you have been able to cope. Death is a very hard thing to overcome.
Oh no_comma_ I hope your kid wasn't too upset. Maybe need to lock the dog in another room when food is out.
Well that's good they yall still had cake. I'm sure you will laugh about this in the future.
Oh thats sounds fun! How much did it cost you? 
Thats great. Will you be camping in the mountains or a foresty place?
I bet that was really exciting!
Oh wow that does sound exciting! Are you still at this university?
That is terrifying! Let me guess_comma_ they were on their phone?
I would have been mad_comma_ too. People on their phones drive like drunk drivers. So dangerous.
I can imagine it was a great experience_comma_ not sure if I will ever have kids.
Defintely and im happy you went through with it after what I would assume was a long decision.
Why did you make that choice?
Iv'e never heard of ballet school being so intensive. Is it something she's considering as a career?
Oh no_comma_ your cat fell out of the window?  Is it ok?
I guess what they say is true - cats do have nine lives.
Did you think you did well?
That's awesome! It can be nerve racking
He should be there for you.
The best thing you can do is get ride of him.
He is not for everyone
There have been a lot of those in politics.
Do you get to anxious about it?
You should look for a therapy that will help you with this issue.
What are you feeling happy about?
That's great. I'm sure you will enjoy being with them
Cheating on her? I am in a relationship and not married_comma_ and I have the thought too
I understand that. I live by a college. All the insanely cute girls are always around at every shop_comma_ restaraunt_comma_ and bar.
Sorry to hear that.  How old is he / she
Yes though it's something everyone goes through...especially if he's going to be a man..I used to be the nerdy fat Asian kid who got picked on til I sucker punched the bully as hard as I could...and never got picked on again
Wow_comma_ that is quite lucky for you! I bet you made some good tips as well!
What let you on your career path to be a male stripper? Did you have a role model?
I can imagine because becoming a mother was the best time in my life!
Aww_comma_ I feel like that with my kids! They're always going to be my babies
how on earth did it get stuck?
Poor thing_comma_ did it need ot be helped?
That is so sweet! Did he end up crying when he saw the puppy?
I have a cat. Her name is Venus. I rescued her from outside after she was attacked by a dog.
Thank you! I am drawn to the stars and sky_comma_ and for some reason it just seemed so fitting. What was the puppy's name?
That's an adorable name. Did your brother name him?
oh my! I graduate this year in a short few months. I worked really hard.
I sure did. Thanks I worked extremely hard!
Are you referring to the 2018 Games in Asia?
Oh_comma_ so you're a soccer fan? I don't really watch sports.
Oh that's good you prepared but that's terrible timing!
It's good it ended up not being too bad_comma_ storms can be very unpredictable 
That's the worst!. Mine was up extra late tonight too.
I know. We just read a bedtime story where the mom paints a night scene on the child's blind to make her feel better.
I hear you! I was college roommates with my sister and now we live hours apart.
That is so awesome to hear. Thanks to cars and everything an hour is nothing nowadays. Especially when you can put portable DVD players in there for the kids!
Awe_comma_ I bet you felt so proud and happy for them. 
I know_comma_ they can be amazing when they are learning and exploring the world... however_comma_ I still don't think having a different colored cup than the one they wanted warrants the response they tend to give. ( I have a 2 year old and a 3 year old son)
I agree. I am still trying to figure out why they fight so much over Blippi and Peppa pig! They are both horrible_comma_ just pick one and get it over with.  I will be miserable through both_comma_ lol
Did she jumped really high or something?
tTHAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF FUN
Oh I am sorry to hear that. Are you doing okay?
I am worried about you. I hope that you will have someone to talk to. 
Aw_comma_ I be so. How old is he?
Wow_comma_ congratulations! That is such an accomplishment. He must be very bright
That is normal.We all get nervous on our fist day of work.
How are you doing on that job nowadays?
I think so too! I swear it was like 2012 yesterday.
That's insane. I heard that the older you are_comma_ the faster time goes by since the percentage of your life that a specific amount of time is gets shorter and shorter.
Right? I didn't think about that. I miss time passing by slowly and being so excited for everything.
I am sorry to hear that. Are you doing better now?
I like keeping busy too. It really helps me stay sane!
No way! What happened...was there a confrontation?
Oh ok. I take it_comma_ he was "cat calling"? There are classier ways of appreciating art.
Haha. Well_comma_ who can judge art_comma_ right?
That's pretty funny. Did your sister ever find out it was you who took it?
One time my cousins dog_comma_ ruby_comma_ almost bit me for trying to put away a bowl of food. So_comma_ I understand how dogs can be with food at times haha.
What would you have done in that situation?
Just be glad that everyone in your class probably has no memory of it now.
Awe_comma_ I am sorry to hear that. Do you think there will be any chance of a reconciliation?
I know it isn't my place to ask_comma_ but why did they disown you?
In the end_comma_ I hope she sees that you were able to make it work_comma_ and if you can and do_comma_ she should meet you half way. You are very welcome :)
Yeah_comma_ I always hate ending conversations as well 2 turns just isn't enough. I will now let you end the conversation_comma_ lol
Serious? Don't you like pizza?
So bad from the vendor
Haha that is terrible! Unless he was hot...
Well in his defense_comma_ it's pretty hot out.
Oh really?! Is she not afraid of the dentist?
Oh that's great! Sometimes it is just difficult to takes kids to the dentist.
You and the rest of the world_comma_ lol. Joking. Joking. Why are you furious?
Yes_comma_ that was horrible what he did. I couldn't imagine what I would do if I had my child ripped from me
Of course_comma_ hindsight is 20/20. But going forward you can live in a way that minimizes regret.
It's really not for them to judge. Do what makes you happy.
I know the feelings I had up until my 20's. Then I just realized how much they had no right to judge me.
You should always be confident and take risks in life.
Yea it reminds me of a time I took a risk on an investment. It paid off!
I second that. I've been to all the parks a bunch of times.
Yea my little siblings love taking pictures with them.
Work hard at it_comma_poverty is no joke. Not an option!
And play smart_comma_do whatever it takes to elevate yourself. That is the attitude.
That's great! You must have good credit. 
That's great_comma_ make sure to keep your utilization low if possible.
In what way are you fearful? I've never thought about that before.
I am 42_comma_ 40 didn't bother me.....there is nothing you can do about the aging process. I just try to take getting older in stride.
Wow... That is exciting. Congratulations! I also won my fantasy football league this year and won $300 as well.
I'm sorry to hear you lost your best friend.
I know the feeling. Seeing my friends kid read the books I used to read brings back great memories.
Riiight. It is just so cool to see the younger generations learn and see the things that once brought us joy at one point.
I still love going on planes. Makes the headaches of airports worth it.
I wish I could still sit in window seats. I'm too tall now_comma_ I can only sit on the aisle.
Why do you say it like that? Is everything okay?
Whoa. I'm really sorry and I really hope that's not the case. 
I am so sorry to hear that. Is it related to your work?
I see. Well_comma_ this is how democracy works and we will have to accept it
Keep calm.That is the very important step you should take.
You should breath deep and start focusing on the issue in hand.
Ah that sounds like a good time. Hope it doesn't rain for you guys.
Yea the radars are usually accurate. Cook good food for me.
I hope they are good cooks.
That's funny.
I always have the worst luck. 
Maybe. I think some people are just born with it.
What did you order?
Oh no! Hopefully you will get to wear them on your next trip to the beach.
That is my favorite thing to do. I am sure they are glad when you are home.
You definitely deserve it.
Oh my goodness I bet! I am sorry to hear that you went through that.
Well that is definitely good to hear. It must be so hard to go that long as somebody's "side kick" and lose them.
That's great you are happy with where you are in life. I think the place we work and the area in which we live make a big difference.
Having a clear and defined path is important. Success comes from hardwork and dedication.
I love to eat there. One of my favorite foods to eat is steak.
I've never tried that but it looks pretty good. One day I have to try that.
That seems bad and I am sorry to hear that. What happened?
I am truly sorry to hear that. Please accept my apologies for your loss. May he rest in peace
I am sorry to heard that.How long were you together.
I agree with you.I was lonely for a whole year.
Was it cold?
Was it cold?
I've worked in retail before. I'd be afraid to get stuck in the freezer.
Why?  Is there something good going to happen on Sunday?
Oh yeah!  Allez les bleus!  But good on tiny Croatia for even making it that far.  That's an incredible story for them.
Nice. That's always a good feeling. 
I bet. I know the feeling well since my car is also on its way out. 
It's so good you stayed loyal_comma_ I think anyone would've appreciated a friend like you.
Yeah because faithfulness is what defines a true friendship_comma_ after all.
Awe_comma_ I am sorry. What made it tough?
I hate when bosses are like that. Is he normally like that? If so_comma_ I would sit him down and talk to him and tell him how his actions are affecting you
I agree with that. Victor mentality. 
That's the spirit that got trump elected.
Oh no! How disappointing. Hopefully you didn't cut yourself!
Oh well at least that is a plus. 
I always wondered how you start something like that up with your partner without hurting their feelings.
Whatever makes you happy I guess. To each their own.
How terrible! I bet your heart stopped in that moment.
People seem to only care about themselves a lot.
I feel you.I also get sad when i see people living of the street.
There not a lot we can do.Maybe presure the local politicians 
Why? Is it something with your work-life balance?
You should take it easy. Just relax and cross your fingers for the best to come yet
Oh no. I am so sorry. That is so hard. My daughters cat got run over like a week after we had him. :( What was your dog's name?
Doodles. That's a cute name! I'm sorry about your dog. 16 Years sounds like a good long life.
What did he do?
If it doesn't work out he can always go back.
I certainly don't. I was miserable as a kid.
Yes_comma_ some worse than others. What do you miss the most?
You can always organize a reunion for your former classmates.
Ugh_comma_ I hate the waiting game. What's the job for? Have you tried calling back and checking in?
Teaching sounds good. We seriously need more amazing teachers. I'll pray that it will all work out for you. 
Were you able to finish right?
LOL.That was funny.The most important thing is that you build the toy.
I'm sorry. We're you close?
I can't imagine what that was like. I hope you find peace.
Oh that's too bad. How long before they get home?
Oh well hopefully it goes quick for you but at least they will have a good trip which is nice!
I hope it goes okay and for you the time passes fast! 
That's so sweet!  Modern technology is amazing_comma_ right?!
Yes that's the bad part.  Was the call that way for her?
Ha ha - I'm glad she didn't really notice it!
It's summer now for me.
Oh_comma_ I see. I felt that way when I was waiting for school to end.
Really? The world cup right?
Of course. I played soccer growing up myself.
This has to be a very stressful time for you. How are you holding up?
I hope they s/he will view you as a valuable member of their organization and do what is necessary to make sure you are well compensated. 
Ahhh.  Math.  I have certainly been there before.  I am so sorry!  Is there any way to retake it?
Don't feel too bad.  I had to take college algebra 3 times before I finally passed with an A.  Sometimes you just need a good teacher.
Congratulations. You finally did it. What is your occupation now?
That is a very noble that you have taken. I wish you successful career with full of joy
That is great to hear. I can tell your family loves you a lot!
It is nice we have days to celebrate mothers and fathers. They deserve the recognition for their hard work!
Oh no! Did you end up talking to your neighbor about it??
Oh well that's a nice thing to do. I'm sure she forgives you because she knows you felt bad and wanted to make it right.
Wow_comma_ that is impressive. I probably couldn't have done it with a tutorial how. I would have walked around with a flashlight until someone felt sorry for me and fixed it
That still is impressive. I bet you did feel like you accomplished something
Wow_comma_happy belated birthday_comma_make sure you have a blast.
Nice_comma_was what were you up to?
Are you nervous about it? I know I was when I had my first interview.
The best thing to do is not worry and just remember what you want to say to the interviewer. You will do just fine!
Well You can be hopeful. But i think you should  stop gambling
If it is sure then you do not need luck
Oh wow. I'm so sorry to hear that. Was this an all the sudden thing or has he been in poor health?
It's so hard how that usually is the case. Never deserved. Is his surgery scheduled soon?
I'm really sorry. I can't imagine what you're going through. I'll be praying that he will get his lungs ASAP and that in the meantime_comma_ you'll feel at peace.
You're welcome. :)
That's so sad. I just had a cat disappear_comma_ it's quite sad.
We thought it might've been hunted by coyotes since we live close to the woods. Pretty crazy.
Wow. They must have been very grateful to you. 
Getting the full-time sounds better taking a one time bonus from him.
Oh my god_comma_ fresh cookies that you hand baked?? What did you do?
HAHAHAHAHA  that what my niece does_comma_ I bring home two candies and she talks me into giving her one then she hides the other when i'm not looking
come on now? you are so full of yourself!Why do you say so?
Sorry about that.
That's so awesome. Isn't it so nice when people do nice things for each other in their communities?
My community is great about that kind of thing. I'm glad you got your money back!
Oh that's great! That's really nice of you. 
Wow that is exciting for sure. You must have been filled with anticipation.
I certainly hope he did propose and that you are still happily living.
Congratulations! Good luck with your future marriage.
Oh no! I hate the dentist too! I haven't been in forever. I'm sorry. You will be okay though! Hoping it all goes well. Is it hurting you?
That makes total sense! Good job for thinking ahead like that!
Sure_comma_ my dad is a Cowboys fan. He misses the days of Troy Aikman and Emmett Smith!
Yeah_comma_ I remember as a boy watching those guys. They creamed Buffalo in the Super Bowl!
Road rage is a problem I deal with too.  I have adult add and tend to be impulsive and am horrible at socializing.  I'm glad your alright and I don't blame you for getting stressed out by that.
I can't believe she didn't at least apologize or wave sorry.  That's why cell phones are horrible and can cause accidents.  I'm glad your ok
Have you ever spoken to someone else about it? It's always a relief to talk things out.
She took care of you when you were little so it only makes sense that you'd want to return the favor. You're a good child.
Oh yeah? What happened that day?
Oh no! I hope everything turned out well at the end of it!
I eventually threw up. Anything you have to say though?
Oh well that sounds like it ended well at least. What was the fight about?
Yea I know how you feel_comma_ you just feel like you are in purgatory waiting for your demise.
Yea but i mean afterwards you dont know if you passed the interview
i think you have the same attitude like me. i really feel pissed off
the best way is to tame it well so that it will have good manners
My same exact sentiments_comma_ it can be lonely out here.
Get registered to some of these dating sites.
That's awesome. What desert is it?
I don't like lemon deserts that much_comma_ but that sounds amazing.
Yea I know how you feel_comma_ I have no idea what im doing in math sometimes
Yea I just aim to pass and pray_comma_ it can be hard sometimes_comma_ depends on the teacher
I have had way too many close calls on my finals. How did you do?
Nice! Good to hear that things worked out for you in the end!
Well that's pretty annoying. He should have given it to you anyway. A- is a great grade.
You probably also learned your brother is a cheapskate_comma_ haha. I hope you did end up getting that car one day!
That is very unfortunate that you put all that work in and were let down. I hope something good came out of it like another good job afterwards.
That is not fair for employers to count education more than life experience.
Yes! Theres nothing like the relief that comes with not having any assignments or projects due
I've never been on a cruise before_comma_ I'm too afraid of the open ocean. Where are you going to go cruising?
Oh that's too bad! Have you told him how you feel?
That's frustrating! Maybe if you just keep putting your foot down he will eventually get the message. I hope he does soon!
Kids are really cute at that age.  Embrace the cuteness while you still can!
No I don't have any kids but I teach so I have other people's kids to fill that space in my heart.
What? why would you do that.
You are so bold. I can't do it.
You like being surprised?
I like presents_comma_ they're surprising.
Oh_comma_ I have only had surgery once I was really scared but it was okay I was knocked out so didn't know what was happening 
I watched so many youtube videos before mine its wierd when they give you the anesthesia 
That is really cool. Did you find a girl you really liked?
Well I hope you are able to find the perfect girl for you!
Good to hear! How did it pay off?
Wow_comma_ that's quite the honor! Good work man!
What type of competition is it?  Im curious.
Wow how interesting!  I really hope you do well.  I am sure you will!
That is good. I am so happy for you. Where will your vacation hold 
I wish to be there too. That has always been my dream place for vacation 
Happy for you. Which course are you taking?
Wow! you nailed it. Sound like a tough course to study
That's interesting. At least you got some new storage space!
Well stealing electronics can usually be harmful to the original user because information is so personally valuable so don't do it again!
Really? How did you win that?
That's great. What do you write about?
That is really sweet_comma_ I saw someone tweet about a baby laughing on the beach for 15 minutes today. Happy babies are fun 
Yes babies are so cute but I like being able to send them home with their parents 
I've always wanted to go there! What did you like most about it?
I bet! I'm guessing it must be good weather_comma_ then?
Wow! That must have been hectic. Did you have a lot of stuff?
That's crazy. The silver lining to moving for me is being able to get rid of all my junk.
That's great to hear! I am sure you deserved it since you put so much effort in the project.
It is good your supervisor takes notice of your hard work. Nothing is more annoying than not getting recognition for effort.
That is amusing to hear. I hope your kids did not cry for their candies
It was wrong of course. I hope you kids would never find out that it was their parent who ate all of their candies
That sounds super fun_comma_ I love florida and orlando its quite awesome.
Yea thats fair_comma_ I could imagine if they are so near by you wouldnt care about them.
That happens to me all the time because I drive a large van with a lot of extras.  It is such a pain!
Maybe we both need to buy one of those chargers that you can keep in your car so you don't have to ask for a jump.
Oh damn_comma_ that's not good. What happened?
What the heck_comma_ that's so bizarre. Sorry to hear that it didn't work out.
What makes your new living facility nicer?
That is awesome. Having more space is always a plus.
i think that would be very unbelievable to run into someone out the country especially from school. Has that ever happened to you?
wow that is awesome where you good friends with them or you just saw them in the halls alot?
Wow_comma_ thats amazing! How did ya'll initially meet?
High school sweethearts_comma_ that's so special. Do you ever regret committing yourself to one person so soon?
Your outlook on love is really refreshing. I wish you two the best with your new futures.
That is a disgrace. Some people just do not get it!
That is understandable. When did this incident occur?
Free? How on earth do you get free cars?
He must have a rich family. I guess you don't?
Damn_comma_ hopefully she gets it then. Why is she looking for a new one?
Man that does sound a lot worse. Well good luck to her then.
Oh wow im the same_comma_ i hope she gets it_comma_ its really stressful
yea its a really big deal if it goes through_comma_ I hope you guys succeed.
That's great. Does she practice a lot?
You must be very proud. I hope she's successful.
I bet you were thrilled. There's nothing like a hearty sandwich to conquer one's hunger!
I tend to pile my sandwich as high as I can and still fit it in my mouth. I am like the Scooby Doo of sandwich doctors.
That's unfortunate to hear. It seems like everyone lost that day.
I am sorry. Hopefully you can make it up to your friend.
what is your exam on?
o wow that sounds very tough but i'm sure you have it as long as you been reviewing the material
I've been in the same predicament. My lease was coming up and I needed a deposit for a new apartment and my friend was able to help me out.
I agree. If more people were compassionate like that then maybe the world wouldn't be as messed up.
That is bad news and hard to deal with.
I sure hope you have a wonderful next Holiday trip very soon.
oh no! did you go out and examine what it is?
It's interesting! What did happen next?
Lol. Hope you had a good camping night!
That sounds like a mixed bag of emotions.
Exactly what I was thinking. Better cherish the time that you have with him until he goes off to college_comma_ but know that he'll always appreciate you.
Oh no! That stuff is no good_comma_ did you have fun or was it more of a mistake? Haha. 
Oh yeah but we all make those mistakes as kids_comma_ it's good you've matured since then! Haha. 
That's great. My mom had three boys_comma_ so I'll be lucky to have a daughter.
It was more shared with the whole family. But later my dad hired a maid.
You must be really good with reading comprehension and remembering facts. Congratulations.
So you've retained all of that info and recalled it from memory during the test. I was never a good history student.
This is how you deal with such people_comma_put him off. Reprimand such bad behaviors.
You joined the group_comma_don't complain next time lol
You are so right. Even some of the worst conditions in my home country are better than most.
I agree. We need to cherish the things we do have in this world.
It could've been a ghost or maybe a robber?
That's awesome that you have a mace. Are you king arthur by any chance?
That's great exercise. Are you a fan of sports?
Deer can be pretty ridiculous. I am glad you are okay.
That's crazy_comma_ I couldn't imagine buying a car at 18. What kind of job did you have that you were able to do that?
That's a pretty great setup so soon in live. You're very fortunate.
Yeah for sure. Luck only gets you so far_comma_ the rest is up to you. 
You definitley had something to be proud of. Not many 18 year olds can say they did that 
Why were you mortified? I don't know too much about net neutrality.
Oh yes I am sure you did great_comma_ public speaking is a good skill too have. 
Why do you have to stress so much to get black Friday sales 
Okay. I think you need to find a better source of income so that you will not have to wait for black friday to get what you want 
Sorry to hear that. Have you talked with your coworker or boss about it?
Well_comma_ maybe just ask for a meeting with your boss and go from there.
The news can be so sad. That is horrible that that occurred!
People need to step up and start helping others. I will pray too
Oh! It's excellence. Hope you enjoy your next year
yeah! you're right. Once you've moved there_comma_ you started to love your city too!
Thats awesome_comma_ i recently reconnected with my friend_comma_ its really awesome when it happens
Yea it is one of the best feelings
hahah yea i have done that more than once.
what flavor was the cookie?
Was it someone you saw in public?
Hitting kids is kind of going out of style. People do timeout more now.
Absolutely_comma_ i can't imagine being betrayed by a friend.
The best virtue in life.
That's great. I just built my first computer actually.
I'm not sure what a commodore is. I don't really program much either _comma_ but I'm interested. I play a ton of pc games though.
Wow getting a promotion is always an awesome thing. You guys must be so happy! Will you guys be celebrating this success?
Fair enough_comma_ that is very reasonable. Maybe you guys can celebrate on the weekend when you guys don't have work.
I hate when that happens.  I wish more people would be more cautious when they drive!
Yes.. it is best to be a defensive driver and keep yourself as safe as possible since there are so many crazy drivers out there!
That is greta. Is she really nice?
Ok_comma_ so it is early days. When is the date?
Well let me know how it all goe!
That sounds crazy! What happened?
That sounds like it would give me a heart attack.
I am sure that was quite a delightful experience_comma_ especially since you were not expecting to enjoy it. Was it regular tea or flavored? 
You had an invigorating tea_comma_ delicious! Would you have it again or was this a one time encounter with tea?
No I don't know my neighbor that well but my best friend lives close so she has my spare key 
If you trust your neighbour it is fine
Nice_comma_ like which ones to be specific?
I love delicious foods more so teri yaki_comma_ so yummy.
I'm glad you made it out alive. I wonder what drugs they were on. Some drugs actually make you more careful.
Good thing he wasn't drunk or he very well could have gotten in an accident. Alcohol really impairs motor skills.
Damn_comma_ what would you rate both of them? I know it might be a little childish but it helps me picture it haha.
Wow he really dated up this time around_comma_ lucky him I suppose.
That's really tough. I can imagine how frustrated you are. Just know that going through trials and struggling is always good for your character and you will end up that much better of a person for getting through it. You can't be too concerned with other's lives_comma_ you just have to try not to compare. 
Oh well that's too bad but their behavior is not right or fair_comma_ and they will deal with the consequences of that themselves. Forgiving them is good for you and for them. Just try your best to let go_comma_ I know it's tough- but people everywhere are way more successful then you and way less successful and you don't compare yourself to them I hope so why focus on one random guy just because he's your brother.
That is good. You finally conquer it all with your patient. 
I will advice though_comma_ in some cases you have to report this to the security agencies 
Sorry to hear that. Was it a difficult course?
That is good if you could pass it.
I know what you mean_comma_ childhood friends are so important and treasured
I agree_comma_ it feels great to have someone stick around for so long
Good for him! Sounds like he's a real slugger!
Did they end up winning the game?
Yum! I used to love Oreo Blizzards. There was a rusty hairpin in my burger from there when I was a kid. I almost swallowed it.
Don't you pick out your own clothes?
People care about the dumbest things.
wow that is awesome are you staying at a friends house? 
wow are you looking forward to seeing the coliseum ? 
sorry about that. what was happening
thats sad. glad you were around to help him
which exam are you taking?
Entrance to what?
Awwww.  That is so sweet.  It is nice to see when young people are actually being nice to each other!
OMG LOL.  Well maybe that wasn't so nice!  Ewwww.
That is outstanding news. You must be a great parent to raise a son who got through college.
Great that he finished early!
Interesting_comma_ sounds like a metal band concert I went to where people were a bit goth. Did you go?
College was an odd time_comma_ people the same age you didn't know that well.
Law seems difficult it seems..
You should  also have a sharp memory to remember_comma_ what ever you have studied..
You seem to be an avid soccer fan. Is Croatia your favorite team?
Oh I get it_comma_ that is pretty cool. I like a good underdog story. So this World cup should be very exciting!
That is really brave of you_comma_ thanks for doing something about it

Wow! that must have been the best surprise for a birthday. You are so loved.
You are so lucky to have her. 
That's intense. I am sorry to hear that but stay positive!
I hope that it does not. Is it a bad part of town?
Like from harry potter?
Dumbledore is one of my favorite characters of a ll time
That sounds like a fun trip. I love camping.
I'm glad the weather seems to be holding up. I live in Florida and it is always hot.
I think you will be fine. Just stay confident!
Please do and you will do great!
That is infuriating to hear! People are just so entitled to things these days_comma_ truly no decency. 
I hate when that happens. Something that you do but someone else takes credit for. I would've yelled at the person!
I hate when that happens.  It makes you wonder if they are really your friend or not.
I know how you feel.  Try not to get too mad_comma_ maybe he had a good reason and didn't want to share it.
I have never been to Chicago. I heard deep dish pizza is incredible!
That's great to hear_comma_ because I love food and pizza.
I am sorry about that. Where are you going?
I have not! Is that at a theme park?
Skydiving sounds like a lot of fun. I need to go!
I want to go so bad. People that are afraid of heights are missing out!

sorry about that. I hope he is doing well now
Don't we all
A lot of times I wake up and am relieved it was only a dream.

How did that wind up going for you?
Oh my gosh_comma_ that is terrible! I hope you were able to salvage it.
I'm sorry to hear that it bothers you in a negative way. I love being alone_comma_ I'm an introvert.
No_comma_ you won't.Enjoy your peace while you have it. You can always go out or join an interest group.
Oh no_comma_ that's terrible! You should fire that landscaper and plant new flowers.
Well you can always get more flowers_comma_ so it'll be okay!

I bet you wore shoes on the street for a while.
That's too bad.
That sounds fun. What kind of job is it?
Oh that's fun_comma_ teachers are some of the most underpaid people in the world.
Oh my!  I hope you learned your lesson and never stole from a friend again.
I can imagine.  I hope you gave them back!
What?that is so scary/ What happened after that?
Sorry about that_comma_you might think of moving to somewhere more safe.

Well then avoid the stories that scare you.
Well there's no reason to waste your time reading scary stories.
Oh wow. so she's kind of famous it seems

Did your girlfriend cheat on you? 
But most people are still faithful in their relationship 
Now_comma_ that is what happens when you are a cat lover.
You are so kind. I'm never good with pets.
Congratulation for the baby. Is a good or bad suprise that our grandmother is coming?
I understand. It is always good to have someone that you can count on.

Oh_comma_ that's awesome. You feeling nervous about that? 
What if it's opposite? 
You never know these days
Oh really_comma_ what was the judge's reaction to that

Really_comma_ so what was your reaction then?
Wow_comma_ that's terrifying you know

Nice. What scholarship?
That's natural. Just don't tell him lol. You'll be alright buddy.

No way that sounds pretty extreme_comma_ did you really?
Haha well that's cool_comma_ did it last long?
Wow_comma_ that is a big decision. Are you well prepared for the move?
Moving can be both adventurous and a big headache. You have to make big decisions about discarding many old possessions and selling your house if you have one.
Hahahaha_comma_ what was she thinking? 
It's really annoying right
She may have done something else to "earn" that promotion_comma_ if you know what I mean ;)
well perhaps you can brush up on some sabotage skills lol :) get her out_comma_ get yourself back in the game. Good luck!
good guys finish last. You have to be like Trump LOL aggressive
think of it this way: It's not revenge_comma_ it's punishment
I'm so sorry to hear that. At least you enjoyed your time with her in the moment?
Well_comma_ hey. At least there's plenty more fish in the sea. Maybe the next one will be the one.
good to hear that_comma_ what is interesting
thats great. i hope they do on my side too
do what?
Yeah they give up.
Wooow_comma_ that's nice... You all will have fun together 
Yeah for sure...  So where are they coming from?? 
That's good to hear! What sort of things has he changed or started doing?
How long did it take him to lose all that weight?
I tried it when I was a student. It wasn't my cup of tea. How did you find it?
Good. What did you think of Amsterdam? I have been there 3 or 4 times.
I am from the UK so I think it's less of a culture shock for us. I remember seeing very high Americans wandering around as if tehy had over indulged.
It was pretty great but it was rough at times. You?
That's great to hear! Mine was mostly happy but of course there was some issues.
Yeah_comma_ I know how you feel. Not exactly the same situation_comma_ though. I was going through with an adoption_comma_ but same amount of responsibilities nonetheless. 
Well_comma_ yes and no. There's ups and downs_comma_ but you get used to the responsibilities. Just expect more stress from your wife than anything else.  
Sorry to hear that. What was the dispute about?
I understand. It should have been not easy.
Wow_comma_ did he forget your address?
Wow_comma_ that is really nice
Lies are never a good thing in a relationship. Have you had a friend who was lying to you?
That is a good place to start_comma_ I mean a relationship not built on truth is very shaky and is liable to fall apart very quickly.
this is so funny.i didn't hear it anywhere.
oh really_comma_its  sounds terrible.
Wow_comma_ cool how did that happen?
That's nice of her_comma_ I love when teachers go out on a limb for students like that_comma_
Oh that's very resourceful of you. Did everything go as expected?
Nice! You sound like a great caretaker.
I'm sorry_comma_ I don't understand?
It's always good to expand your knowledge.
Oh really? Why is that? Seems like you were aware of it
Nice_comma_ good for you my dude. Hard to get girls these days.
I hate when my cat used to do that. Would this happen often?
Cats can really be such strange pets sometimes_comma_ I swear they live off of our momentary hatred for them
hi
how are you
I've not seen the movie
Hahaha I really love to see horror movies_comma_ but I don't usually get scared
Very true. Who has helped you out recently?
How long have you known them?
k then what u do that time
k good_comma_ here after becareful with them
Like bad dreams or what?
Oh that really sucks_comma_ hopefully you get that dealt with.
A mother_comma_ father and a brother. You?
Nice! Family is so important.
What engineering type did you graduate in?
That's good to hear. You can always keep searching for that dream job while you work.
That it is cool. There was an old game that I loved Crash Bandicoot. Recently_comma_ they did a remaster of this game.
Did you try Crash Bandicoot Kart? It is the one that I liked the most. I was playing this game several hours a day with friends.
That must be really annoying! What were they late to this time?
4 hours late! Totally unacceptable! But hey_comma_ at least you live near a beach.
Greed consumes all. By the way who are you implying about?
Totally agree. They say one thing and do another just to keep in power.
Jealousy is the root of hatred_comma_too bad
Why will u be consumed?
That's awesome. I never won_comma_ but I got close!
That's good man there will be more trust me.
Tell me about it. How long have you been job hunting for?
Did you travel anywhere for your vacation?
Awww_comma_ are you always shy?? 
Woow we are directly opposite of each other
what does the pen symbolise
would you be using the pen for anything special
What field is that?
That's awesome. What charity?
Wow thats great. Were you delighted?
I wish I could be as lucky as you. Well happy belated birthday.
That's not good. Do you find yourself in that situation frequently?
I suppose that works. Sorry you feel that way.
Wow_comma_ that must be very terrifying
That is so bad_comma_ really not cool.
That's not too bad. Computer science isn't easy by any standards.
That's cool. I'm studying biochem at the moment.
That is true_comma_ but why the air nikes? Haven't you heard about their effect on women?
They're known to cause erectile dysfunction? There's chemicals in the laces_comma_ dude! A conspiracy I tell you! Done by OBAMA!
Thats horrible. I mean if you have a job at least make the effort to get there on time.
Sorry to hear that. I guess your boss must have been feeling the same as you were about the nanny.
Oh boy_comma_ that is a very delicate situation. Do you plan on telling her?
I understand your fear_comma_ but it will be worse of you keep that big of a secret from her_comma_ especially if she finds out some other way.
That's good to hear_comma_ it's always great to have a good relationship with your parents!
Yeah_comma_ unconditional love is something that is hard to come by.
That's amazing! I wish I could lift that much.
You'll get there in no time. I believe in you.
Ah_comma_ reminiscing can be nice sometimes though. What was the name of the song?
I remember Martin Mystery! I loved that show.
Of course_comma_ I waking up early just for it.
Oh really? That sucks_comma_ if they just asked people would usually be ok with it too.
Hopefully it isnt for anything horrid like drugs.
Wow_comma_ that means you can't sleep with the light off
Wow_comma_ fear is a bad experience
Babies are a treasure. Do you have any?
My wife is 6 months pregnant.
Does ghost really exist?
Wao_comma_i dont want to see them at all
Congrats my friend. How old is he now?
It only gets worst once he's in his teenage years and bringing girls home! But it's worth it in the end.
What works in particular? 
I agree wholly_comma_ quite an impeccable spectrum. I read online on 4chan that da Vinci was likely an alien from the future. 
I was always jealous because my brothers didn't need to work as hard after I moved away.
It was funny because I was out with one of the prettiest girls ever telling her I was jealous. I shouldn't have been though.
They have done well - do you think they are unknown though? The were semi-finalists in 1998 and have had lots of good players over the years (Prosinecki_comma_ Suker_comma_ Boksic_comma_ Savicevic_comma_ Boban)
I always loved their strip when I was younger. It was the first time a team had played in checks.
I hope it is not too bad. You sent it to who?
What did you say to them?
That sucks. Where were you supposed to be travelling to?
Wow_comma_ Jamaica would is one of the places I dream of visiting. I guess work comes first though.
Why_comma_ have you have bad experiences?
I'm sorry to hear that.
What made you good children?
What country were you brought up in?
Cool_comma_ whose testimony?
Are they still going on about the election?
Have you tried therapy?
Yes I think so. I know people who have overcome phobias and fears that way.
Awesome_comma_ where in Europe will you be visiting?
I'm jealous. It will be amazing and I think you'll have great fun there soaking up the culture and wine also I suppose.
What stuff? 
Who stole them? 
Yes_comma_its really coming
We_comma_pray and have faith
Well done_comma_ you must be very proud of yourself.
Well done_comma_ great job.
Yes me too_comma_  is that because of the gifts?
Yes it was so exiting! what about now_comma_ do you receive many presents?
Great_comma_ it hasn't got here yet.
Central.
Do you honestly believe there were less crimes back then? Or were they just better concealed
That's cool.  I feel like that was true in your world.  But as far as I knew the world was a living hell for colored people more so then than now...but I'm positive the news today only highlights what is convenient for corporate America
I understand. Do you like Tony Montana in the movie Scarface?
It is a very nice movie.
Why do they terrify you that much? 
Oh. Yeah_comma_ some people don't get scared enough because they didn't turn lights off. 
Honestly_comma_thats very true
Thats the way he is_comma_can u imagine_comma_so ungodly show
I agree_comma_ it's better to live in your own surroundings and have your own independence.
I'm happy for you. You only have one life and should do what makes you happy.
who doesn't? missing anything can ruin the whole trip.
I think it's better to have too much than not enough though. right?
Wow_comma_ very interesting_comma_ how did you see yourself then
I mean_comma_ how did you see yourself when you were small
I hear you. Relationships are hard. What happened?
promises are very important. builds trust. Ultimatums should do the trick ;) 
Woow_comma_ are you really good in the court? 
Woow_comma_ I guess I will like to play you someday
Ouch_comma_ that really sucks. What kind of industry do you work in? 
Ah_comma_ I can see why that would be stressful/upsetting. Well_comma_ it is good to plan ahead_comma_ but don't stress about it too much until you know for certain you are part of that 25%_comma_ the odds are still in your favour.
That was rude. Maybe she didn't hear you?
Lol. That's funny. Good story for when you become her boss.
Why does that have to change now?
Ah okay! Makes sense_comma_ I'm sure being a parent is no joke.
I always give. You never know if it's Jesus in disguise to test your heart
is he still there maybe? hope so. Remember the movie Groundhog Day. It was the homeless guys last day
Sweet words like what?
oh. Meditating works. Unless you fall asleep and have a nightmare.
Thats lovely_comma_i pray i will have one
Thats so good and fun_comma_children are the best
Yeah? How big was the tip?
That's cool. I never understood why places won't allow their workers to take tips... what business is it of the employer if you get money? Anyways_comma_ what kind of place do you work?
Cox a poor man is automatically an Angry man
For sure...  I love working for my money
Yes we should be grateful to our parents for how they took care of us
Yes_comma_ I think it is easier to remeber when you become a parent yourself.
Wow that is so exciting !
How sweet! 
Good luck. Get enough sleep.
Hope you ace it.
Is that Tennis? 
Wow_comma_ that must've been a shock then.
Thats horrible_comma_ how could they get it wrong?
They should pay you for the time you spend on sorting it out.
Yes_comma_ I know_comma_ they lose so much time instead of solving the important problems.
Yes and they seem so full of themselves while doing it.
I haven't seen it 
Wooow that must really be interesting 
I have a few times_comma_ my mom is really into cooking shows_comma_ so I watched them a lot growing up_comma_ and still catch a few now and then.
Yeah_comma_ Gordon can be pretty supportive too_comma_ and soft spoken_comma_ which is surprising. 
Yeah_comma_ and mostly near the end. When its the first few rounds I think he feels they haven't earned any sort of sympathy or support_comma_ since things are just starting out.
some friend. Maybe he's insecure and thought you or her were flirting?
well then he shouldn't have jumped to conclusions. Things aren't always what they seem
oh no. sorry to hear that.
Pets are family. We still want them to be around no matter what.
I'm sorry_comma_ why not?
I completely understand_comma_ I've been in that predicament and it sucks.
Really bad...  Did you come last?? 
Awww you need to practice more often
I don't think you are alone there! What do you find so irritating about it?
I know what you mean. All the people seem to be the same types - fame hungry narcissists
Sorry to hear that_comma_ what happened?
That was a hard watch. They were a strong young team and should have won but missed a few chances in the first half.
Shame on you .Did you at least pass? 
And you didn't get caught either?
Wow that sounds like fun
I completely understand
I absolutely feel the same way. It is a rare trait_comma_ but there are few people who do better on tasks on their own than as group task. 
Yes_comma_ that too. Or does not contribute as much like they should_comma_ i.e._comma_ critical thinking/participatory contributions
Hah! 
I have no idea what that is.
OH. If he is guilty I hope he gets what's coming to him.
Well done. Did you study very hard for it or are you just very smart?
Well done_comma_ good effort.
Oh no_comma_ I'm sorry_comma_ why?
You should make sure to keep to your word to help_comma_ then.
I guess children could have that tendency_comma_ how fun
That is amaziing!
Cool. Congratulations
I still have two years left. I hope to have that feeling too.
Oh no sounds scary.  What happened next?
That goodness for that! There is nothing worse than hearing noises like that when you are alone walking.
haha. Ye like its normal to them. Nasty
hey_comma_ eating dogs are normal to some! sick
Oh_comma_ that's not good. Did he say anything? 
How come? Direction of life swaying you away from your family? 
oh no why?
That sucks. I couldn't be without my kids. Maybe you should go to counseling.
I bet you were. Who isn't?
I couldn't wait to not wake up early. Then I got a job lol
I consider myself a foodie now. Im skinny_comma_ but I love food
oh noo
Me too.  They really are a man or womans best friend.  Do you have dogs?
I have a little pug.  She is always so pleased to see me and loyal.  Are your dogs the same?
Its really devastating. But what really happened
Wow_comma_ but its your personal life
Oh yeah? When was this?
That's too bad. I actually own a ball python_comma_ she's pretty cute.
is that good or bad?
OH wow. That's awesome. I want to adopt too. Maybe foster.
Oh? What did he or she do? 
What are the payments for? 
That's great_comma_ congratulations
Omg_comma_ i'm so sorry. I just realized my eyes focused on promotion results. I think there is a silver lining in every situation
What meal do you speak of? Breakfast? Lunch? Dinner? Midnight snack?
That is awful!!! What happened to the fly? Did you manage to shoo it away or end its poor_comma_ miserable life?
Oh no_comma_ that is not cool
I understand how you feel_comma_ such thing have happened to me before
What happened there?
Are you doing okay? anything serioius?
that sounds like a lot of fun 
wow be safe
Sorry to hear about your loss. Sometimes its better for it to be sudden rather than wait 6 months for the cancer to destroy you
everything passes with time
so decide wisely how it is spent :)
When are you going to find out your acceptance? 
Oh_comma_ congratulations! Which college? 
Oh now why is that
oh wow
Wow_comma_ now you have a brother_comma_ that is good to know
So_comma_ how cute is he?
Hello my friend! I will gladly wish you all the luck in the world_comma_ if you would only tell me what I am wishing it for!
Ah_comma_ I see! Do you feel prepared for the examination? Did you spend a lot of time hitting the books?
Of  course I have_comma_ it's really hard 
Was it in the morning? Did you rush home immediately? How did you manage?
college changes you. Sometimes for the worse. Glad to hear about your brother
probably boosted his self confidence too
Yes_comma_ I agree it's a big concern. Do you live in an area of the world directly affected?
That's really scary! I'll try to keep spreading the word for people to be more eco-conscious.
How did it go?
Thats good. It doesnt always work out that well.
you and me both
That is good_comma_ do you like nice cars?
I am sorry about your car trouble_comma_ good luck with that.
You must be really happy_comma_ I bet you have a beautiful wife and lots of money in the bank :)
That is what matters_comma_ to have a supportive and lovely wife
I understand. I have been lonely most of my life. But_comma_ it gives it back and it makes up the loneliness part. 
I have a solution for that_comma_ but I wouldn't advocate you doing it. 
I can only imagine the destruction and how horrible it is to deal with that!
I am very sorry to hear that. I hope for your sake that things are getting back to normal and the destruction is being taken care of.
thats great_comma_ I feel there is someone out there for everyone
I hear you there _comma_ I have also_comma_ but now I am in the best relationship ever!!!
Oh really? Why is that? Because you don't have to deal with their antics while they're knocked out?
I can imagine. Fortunately_comma_ I don't have any kids yet_comma_ so I do not know the pain of dealing with a bunch of crazy kids! Although_comma_ it must be very rewarding.
It is one the worst pains. You would think we'd keep our toes more protected
Stepping on legos are just as bad. and they are my kids' favorite toys!
That sounds so frightening! Was your husband helpful?
I agree! I would have been screaming_comma_ too! (And I would have been annoyed at my husband for laughing!)
I'm so sorry_comma_ how sad.  Do you wish you had been with her to say goodbye.
Of course I can understand it_comma_ but at least she probably didn't suffer and is now in heaven.
That is always nice. Were they excited to see you?
That is awesome. Life can be random like that sometimes.
Never. I don't remember a time when it was that cheap anywhere in the world
Good memory. We all have to change with the times.
I don't even take beer
Nooo_comma_  the first time I took it_comma_  I misbehaved
Wow you sound really prepared for something.
Oh no_comma_ is the end coming?
I can imagine_comma_ and how did things go?
Great_comma_ it is true that new places and situations can be exciting but scary at the same time
Oh wow_comma_ that has to be a bucket list item for sure.
That would have been fun_comma_ maybe next year
Wow_comma_ why did you involve your self in spilling a bowl of cereal?
That's very serious. What are you going to do about the bowl now?
Cool.  guess now you can be president.
I want to Secretary of Treasury. Is that still a thing?
Really
Network do disappoint
Omg. I know exactly how you feel. I had a lump on my back but got it removed. Turned out to be just fatty tissue. Size of a tennis ball !
Good deal. I think it was stress related.
Wow that's nice_comma_  he must be very intelligent 
Awww that's nice_comma_  just take care of them 
Happy Friday indeed! yes I can't wait to finish work for today even when i am just beginning.
Yeah_comma_ I have to.  And do you have plans for the weekend?
Oh wow. Did your friend do something to upset you or something like that? Or were you just wanting some alone time?
Well everyone has their pace. Maybe the next time you go you can invite her but take more time. It's fun_comma_ either way!
Really? What sort of cooking do you like to do?
I love spaghetti myself! I'm not a good cook at all though. I'm always eating out.
Yeah that's very true. But it is much easier than learning to cook myself.
Cool. Most people dont like training.
I bet he appreciates you being nice though.
That was nice of her. I like pulling surprises on people too.
Hope you had a good birthday.
I live in an apartment so I take mine out to the dumpster every few weeks. I feel your pain though. Growing up I had to take ours down our steep driveway every week.
It is daunting. I think I still have nightmares about it. I feel dirty just thinking about it right now.
Must have been a good result.  Was it for a job_comma_ school_comma_ or for medical results?
I am sure your family was proud of you_comma_ as well!
I am so sorry to hear that_comma_ it must have been heartbreaking. How did your family cope?
Well that's good to hear. Possessions can be replaced but your family is all that really matters in the end!
I bet that is an experience you are still trying to get used to
I see a lot of cars that do not watch out for motorcycles_comma_ be careful out there
Thats awesome. I wish everyone could go to college if they wanted
yeah. if only
Money issues are always hard.
Well_comma_ you should look into that
Oh no! I hope you are ok.
Things happen we cant do anything about it_comma_ I hope this accidently wont affect you in the long term
Everything was in the end_comma_ but at first not so much.
Yeah_comma_ it was a nice learning experience.
It must have been embarrassing. Hope it ended well for you.
I'm happy for you.
Oh no!  Did they react by laughing_comma_ helping_comma_ or ignoring?
I can see where that would be embarrassing.  I hope your pride wasn't hurt too much... or you physically!
News that big would be a shock to anyone! How did you both handle it?
I'm glad you both found the courage to face it head on. Nice job!
Most definitely!. Dogs are important members of a family.
Indeed. My son called our dog his cousin for a little while...weird I know.
Oh_comma_ that is frustrating! I love Chinese food. What did you order?
Crab rangoon is one of my favorites. I would be bummed too. I think I know what I am having for dinner tonight.
Yes! They are super fun. Have you? 
I always am as well because I am not an artist by any means. 
Oh no! Is everything okay now?
I know that's tough. It's scary when your kids go through something like that. It never leaves you when its time to do it all over again.
Thats good news! What did they do to surprise you? 
Amazing_comma_ Im happy for you. :) 
Why were you struggling?
I understand. It is impossible to live with only one income for family. I am happy she have an interview.
Being in debt is so stressful and I'm sure that just adds to it. 
I don't blame you. I have been in that position with a credit card I forgot to pay when we moved and they didn't have the correct forwarding address. Stress on top of stress. :(
I would have loved to study criminal justice
I hear you. I love true crime_comma_ so I think that would be such a fun thing to study
Oh no_comma_ what a sad and scary situation. How are they now?
I can't imagine how hard that must have been. I'm glad he is doing better!
People drive more and more badly. Did you take the plate number?
I understand. I am happy that nothing bad happened to you.
Oh no that's unfortunate_comma_ did you make fun of him or something?
Oh_comma_ well sometimes we say things we don't mean. If you apologize he'll probably accept it and be fine again.
Ohh thats great news_comma_ Congratulate him on my behalf.
No one dies along_comma_ I am sure there might be a person  in this world that is made for you _comma_ this is just not the right time to meet that guy. Just wait and it will come in front you when you really need it.
Yup! enjoy the life at its fullest without worring
It sounds good just reading those words_comma_ what kind was it?
Well pizza for breakfast every once and a while won't kill you_comma_ it sounds delicious.
Wow! Was it a scratcher or did you have to pick numbers?
Wow. Lucky you. You should try it again.
Cool! Where are you going?
Wow! Have you been there before? They have an amazing culture
Wait. What happened?
That's good_comma_ no? Don't you win then?
OH no. I didn't have that problem in MExico
It was two years ago. I cant remember where. We stayed on the beach all day.
Nice_comma_ I don't know this sport. What are the rules?
I am happy that she is trying something. Sport is important for kids.
I have always wanted to work abroad. What work are you doing there?
Cool. And congrats on your future engagement!
I can see why you feel that way. Sometimes addicts aren't in full control of their decisions_comma_ though.
I think you have a right to be mad over that. 
wow! i would have felt some type of way to. what did you do after 
yea or be there next time she makes dinner and give her tips eating raw chicken is very bad
Have you tried making any?
maybe try going out to concerts or clubs or sporting events_comma_ somewhere you can find people with common interests
Oh no. Is there a lot of parking available?
I agree. I had an apartment with limited parking and people that didn't live there always parked there anyway.
None that I know of!  I feel you.. if I ever had a daughter I'd be overprotective and stressing
Nope lock her in the basement
Where can you get that kind of weather.
You had me at cheap liquor
That's cool.  It's good to have loyal friends
What are some personality traits you both have in common
That's important. There's always tomorrow though.
I wish. I bought a spin bike in January and have used it once. I have to quit smoking.
This happens many times_comma_ they just don't care of us
our siblings_comma_ leaving us all alone in a party or a club.
What was the song?
Is it short skir't long jacket. I love that song.
Oh no that's so gross! Do you know what
My landlord has the same issue. 
Yes same for me just have to fix up the credit score a bit more ha.
Wow that sounds pretty stressful
Did he / she turn out fine without complications?
Wow is that really something that happens?
I don't think I believe you. 
Well_comma_ is that something you can do?
Right_comma_ well is there any other way?
Look carefully before you sign.
That's cool. Was it not like that before?
My family is like that too. 
He didn't bring you anything?
That's strange. I always try to buy gifts for my family when I go on a trip.
Ewww. I haven't done that in a while. Thankfully.
They sure do. Isn't it the law?
Oh that's the worst_comma_ I try to remember to charge but it's hard to remember every time.
So he's the culprit! He better start charging it or else it's revoked !
What were you guys looking to buy?
I've done that more than once_comma_ I'm terrible at names
That is interesting_comma_ what things do you do while living in America to keep your heritage alive?
I would imagine that might be difficult_comma_ perhaps there are some online social groups you could join as well?
Just be careful not to burn it.
No sauce at all? Surely you didn't mean that too?
Oh no. Sorry to hear that. IS it different now?
Be patient and things will fall into place. You'll be fine.
OH no. Were they okay?
Be careful. It could have been worse.
Well that must be exciting to have so much variety_comma_ how old are they?
You sound like a great parent_comma_ they're lucky to have you!
Must've been a pretty vivid dream
Did you grow up with dogs
Family is important.
I have three. They are my world. I wish we lived in the country and not the city.
oh no_comma_ that must have been terrible.
how long ago was it_comma_ were you hurt?
well_comma_ we all do. I hope you achieve what you set out to do
oh_comma_ well what are you looking forward too?
It was a fire warning?
Wow_comma_ what is it a big one?
That has to be disappointing. Can you change your plans?
Now you have something to look forward to.
I think that's the way to go when it comes to a wedding. Use the money for your future as a couple_comma_ not for one day. But to each their own_comma_ so you were impressed?
My suggestion is to go for your favorite food rather than some fancy catered food that you don't even enjoy!
Oh no_comma_ that's terrible. Can you walk maybe with some support at least?
I see_comma_ that's too bad but maybe there will be more marathons you can participate in in the future. 
Did you get any damage?
It could've been much worse. That's good.
Oh no! I would have been so disgusted! And mad!
That sounds awful. I hope you filed a complaint with the restaurant!  
awww_comma_ when are you planning to visit them?
i really hope you will be able to visit them then! I know how you feel_comma_ I didn't see my parents for a couple of years
Nice_comma_ there is not a lot of people like you
Good
Did it do much damage to it?
Man_comma_ that really stinks. Any chance it was caught on video?
Oh no_comma_ why were you fighting?
I'm glad you guys could just shrug it off. But I imagine you guys were pretty mad during to break out into a fist fight.
wow nostalgic. Wish you had time machine..
best phase of our life.
Do you know where you're going yet?
Well_comma_ that's a nice plan. I hope you enjoy yourself.
Oh no. That's a nightmare.
She will be fine. 
Oh wow_comma_ is she nervous about it?
How come?
How far away has she gone?
Any chance you could move too?
OH no. Is everything okay now?
Well at least he changed. That doesn't always happen.
I hate that. It makes it really hard to want to go home.
That would be good for you. Maybe you will get some good neighbors then.
You weren't thinking about the surgery at all?
That would freak me out too.
That is bad. I hope you found a solution with him.
You can sue him
What song / instrument was being played
Nice I love Metallica.  Was he using a loop station and a backing track or what
Wow that's pretty good_comma_ you must be a member of the thousand pound club?
Yeah I used to be a powerlifter_comma_ but injures cut my career short unfortunately_comma_ stay healthy!
Yes_comma_ I watch the show. That is a bit scary though but not that much.
Ohh come on its not that scary_comma_ you should watch whole season.
Haha_comma_ Ok as you wish then
Nice did you become sort of a nature girl after that experience? Or were you just traumatized haha
That's pretty cool.  So I'm guessing you're more of a city gal
That's sad_comma_ maybe you were meant to be with your ex though. 
I know but I think we're meant to stay with our first loves honestly_comma_ but maybe that's too idealistic.
Was it a nice one?
Do you have kids?
It's never to late to start new. You guys will be fine.
Is it too hot to cook or do you just hate cooking?
Don't feel bad_comma_ I have those days_comma_ too. I keep boiled eggs handy for those times eating out gets too excessive. (protein)
That's a good strategy.
I didn't I was a cheerleader though if you want to count that.
Well at least you can find an excuse to step outside the house and mix it up!
I love Call of Duty.  What's your rank
What was the announcement?
Wow_comma_ congratulations! I bet you worked hard for that!
I wish you'll also move soon. anyway I'm happy for your neighbor. 
Everyone has their time_comma_ yours will come soon
What kind of laptop is it?
That sounds nice. I like having a touch screen on my work computer a lot.
what are you goals that you are planning?
money is the goal that everyone dreams of
That's great_comma_ how many people?
That's nice_comma_ I plan on having 10 kids.
I was caught stealing once when I was younger. It was so embarassing_comma_ never did it again.
We learn from our mistakes.
I didn't go until I was thirty and it wa still fun!
It is a great experience. Expensive though
What kind of pizza? Now you're making me hungry!
Oh man_comma_ I bet that is gonna hit the spot!
Cool. I still get excited when my kids say new words.
3 and 4. The amaze me almost everyday
Oh I know what you mean! It is even worse when you ask for their manager and the manager gives you a major tude!
Right? They can go get a job as a garbage collector if they want to act that way!
What game was it? Did you give him tips?
Was he upset with you for it?
Oh snap! That is not a good thing to hear about.
Well probably should confront him and if he's lying get rid of him.
That's cool.  How old are they now
Wow that is quite a gap...do you still keep in touch with each of them
Some people are just plain rude. I'll bet you really wanted to punch the coach.
Did the other boxer react to the way you were fighting?
As a fat guy who wore all black and played Magic: The Gathering everyday in the library_comma_ I can relate lol.
I never got in any fights_comma_ but I never got pushed around either.
That is so sad! How are you doing now? Did your house get repaired?
I can imagine how apprehensive it makes you now. I'm sorry you went through that. 
You should be. Chemistry is so hard.
Do you find that you have a natural ability for it or do you have to study 
The only pizza I have ever had at the gas station was some pizza from 7/11. Where have you had it at?
Is it priced well?
Oh no! I opened an expired can a long time ago. I check everything twice now.
You can get them back now
Uh oh. Sounds like a bad idea lol.
Well that should make it easier then.
I've always wanted a surpirse party!! Were you happy that they surprised you in this way?
I always find it amazing that people never see it coming.
How exciting for you. Were you surprised?
Sounds like it will be a lot of hard work to attend such a school but well worth it in the end.
I know! I'm going school shopping tomorrow. Its tax free weekend!
No kidding. Plus I'm buying for two so double the cost this year.
What about it brings back memories?
That is always fun. Lots of good memories there.
Ha_comma_ many times. I once blamed my dog for breaking a friend's TV_comma_ but it was me
Was it a good reason? I can't say I've ever done that before
Oh man! That must of hurt even if it didn't break.
It's crazy how glass is hard to notice when it's like perfectly clean.
Did you do something really fun?
I know what you mean. Sometimes in can all the difference in the world to be able to just relax for a while.
How did you manage that? 
Oh that makes sense. I hope you found out quickly before anyone else could see. 
That must have been really hard on you.
At least you had the dog to cheer you up!
Good for you. How long will it take to save up?
Do you have somewhere close where you will be able to go with it?
Have you followed up with your HR department to ask what was missing from your resume or experience that will help for next time?
Not if you do your homework first. Go in with specific questions. Like_comma_ "What can I do now to improve my chances for the next opportunity?"
That is great! Has he overcome an illness or heart issue? That can be serious and very scary!
Oh wow that is great_comma_ is he feeling better since showing improvement?
What happened? did you get the best surprise of your life?
So_comma_ how many people were in attendance? and what special gift did you receive?
Those kind of exams are really important. Did you study before the accident?
Man that is just awful though that happened to you. What was the out come of the exam?
Wow_comma_ thats scary. Did they have a gun?
Oh_comma_ the ole snatch and grab. Still must not have been a good feeling.
Oh that doesnt sound good! What all happened?
What was the case about?
have they contacted the lender for a loan modification?
I wish there was something I could do to help
Yes I grew up with 4 brothers and they always did it to me ..haha
Did he return it?
Oh that is not good! I am sorry for your loss.
That is a interesting way of being positive i guess.
I can imagine! Why did someone give you flowers? 
That is so sweet. I hope you receive more flowers in the future from your loved ones. 
These children hold a very special place in your heart. It's amazing that when this happens you never knew that you could love someone so much.
She will always remember the special bond that you have.
Well that is good! What class is it for?
Well hopefully you do well on it.
i've had hundreds. I know my toilet well
Man_comma_ that's gross! I would have freaked out.
How did you prepare?
Oh okay_comma_ Im unfimiliar with snow storms because I live in Florida_comma_ but I would guess it is much like preparing for a hurricane maybe/
I hope you didn't get hurt. Did people laugh at you?
Was it caught on video?
I sure do. I moved into a dump lol.
Yeah_comma_ it was nice. It was a dump_comma_ but it was my dump.
That must have been a wonderful feeling! It must have been hard not having your friend around for awhile.
She must have traveled very far. I am glad you two have reunited!
What's the news? Do you have an interview?
I hope you're well prepared!
if they have kids I'm sure they understand. Sometimes you just can't have nice things.
Yeah_comma_ thats too bad. But_comma_ I can understand her side too. Sometimes things can't be replaced.
Oh no_comma_ what happened to your wipers?
I bet that was scary!
Oh no. It's hard to get mad at them when there really isn't anything you can do about it now.
Maybe a car dealership could help.
Did you have a team that you were rooting for?
That's the great thing about sports_comma_ anything can happen.
It is nice. How old is she?
Ah ok_comma_ they grow very quickly.
Had you been trying long to break it?
Good for you.That has to feel like such an accomplishment.
Well good work on getting the new job. I recently transitioned to a new job too recently. I'm in the same boat.
It does indeed. Why were you feeling uneasy_comma_ if you don't mind me asking?
Dang! That's awesome! Did you get any cool presents?
Wow that's really neat! What kind of gift cards did you get? Gift cards are always nice.
I really like whataburger - I think they have the most tastiest burgers. What did you get from your family?
I've been thinking about getting a nintendo switch for a long time now. I used to play mario tennis on the n64 all the time.
oh_comma_ that stinks_comma_ was the milk expired?
Were you able to save your meal and get some more milk or something else to drink?
spilled spoiled milk.. i can understand how that was disheartening for you.  what did you end up doing for lunch?
Oh my goodness_comma_ you must have stubbed it pretty hard!
My husband broke his toe one time and it is permanently bent now! It looks pretty goofy. 
That's pretty neat. It's always good to hear that people are getting fit to feel swell about themselves.
It does. I worked my butt off trying to get in shape at mine. What kind of gym do you go to?
Wow! What was taking so long?
I bet you were annoyed! Hopefully it didn't make you late to anywhere you needed to be!
No_comma_ I haven't been to a real haunted house before. I always go to fake ones around Halloween. Why do you think yours is haunted?
That does sound pretty creepy. Whenever I hear strange noises in my house at night_comma_ I get pretty spooked myself. Have you ever found anything?
People are only human. There is no harm in looking.
Unless your going to put a bag on her then you better find a way to deal with it.
I love going to concerts. Who did you go see and where was the venue?
I'm a huge fan of casinos! My favorite game is blackjack. What's yours?
That is great. Some of the best romantic experiences are at school dances.
Sounds like you had a wonderful night. I am sure she felt the same way.
Awwww_comma_ well that;s too bad. Hopefully the owner is as loving towards it as you would have been. What kind of dog was it?
Sounds like a fun dog to have! Maybe you can check out some more shelters and find a similar one?
Sorry about that. Did you talk to your manager to understand why you did got selected?
I hope you get it next year. Good luck.
I recently got back from a trip abroad as well! Traveling is a blast. Where are you going?
Dang_comma_ now that sounds like a swell adventure. Which one are you most excited to visit?
Dogs are so much fun. It is amazing how smart they are.
Little dogs are so much fun. I have a big dog and a little one.
Breaking off a relationship is tough business. How long did it last for? Was it serious?
Wow_comma_ that's brutal. I'm really sorry to hear that. Do you have any plans on looking for any new anytime soon?
Wow_comma_ how exciting. Did you have fun?
Was it your birthday or something special?
Oh man. That must have been nerve wrecking.
were they on the phone
That can be so much fun. 
Reconnecting usually makes for a fun time.
Was it a 1 story house? Was it by a lake or the sea?
Wow_comma_ thats crazy. Was everything in the house a total loss?
That still stinks. That happened once in a house I was renting. Water filled half the 1st floor. 
Yea. My current crew is about 35 people but I  need at least 5 more. Hopefully the next batch last longer.
I feel the same_comma_ man. I always tend to overeat whenever there is good food about. Did you do anything to make it up to them?
That is a kind gesture. I'm sure they will forgive you. What kind of cake was it?
It is nice to have some time to care of ourself. What book did you read?
I like a lot this show. I am fan but I never read the book.
I'm sorry. Did they get them all?
Is it to late to plant more?
Oh_comma_ wow_comma_ I guess you were embarrassed? It happens to us all though_comma_ so you just laugh it off!
I do that too! Or laugh at the wrong time_comma_ so I understand!
You sounded very prepared. How do you feel about it? Think you passed?
Good to hear that you did well. You'll make valedictorian before you know it!
That sounds great! It sounds like you really studied hard. I hope you did wonderful on it.
It sounds like you did great. Studying is the biggest part really.
Oh_comma_ that's annoying! I hate going to the doctor...freaks me out. I always feel like they're going to tell me I'll die in 5 weeks
Similar to most things_comma_ yea. What was wrong with your foot?
Oh that can be annoying sometimes_comma_ I hope they're not too serious.
Oh well that doesn't sound too bad_comma_ I hope he gets some in return though.
I am supposed to be going to an amusement park with friends this weekend_comma_ hoping they have fair type rides there. 
What is your favorite ride?
Well_comma_ how big was it_comma_ and where for?
That's the best kind. What are your plans for it ?
Are they just great in general or did they do something extra special?
Aw :) I wish I had kids. I think it would be worth it
that sounds like fun_comma_ how long do you know each other?
I see. What kind of restaurant did you guys go? 
To be honest_comma_ i have never visited it yet. But I am very eager to go there
In which state is the DisneyLand that you had been is located?
Theyre clearly fatcats_comma_ thats how. Where did you move to? 
isnt california like really hot? Im not sure if id be able to tolerate the temperature to be honest_comma_ do you intend to move back to los angeles in the future?
i pay 160 euros a month for my apartament lol_comma_ 2400 is insanity tbh. and 85 degrees is like 30c D: that is so hot!
i actually dont_comma_ my country decided to illegally deny it to me_comma_ but most people do. you could move to EU if you really wanted to_comma_ rent sure would be way more afforadable regardless of which country you pick
What kind of phone was it?
Oh no! How awful. I'm buying a house on Monday!
/Am not sure_comma_ what i deserve
oh thank you!! for your wishes!!
So_comma_ did you go to her dinner_comma_ or do what you had planned?
I find that they don't respect you until you start telling them no.
Was everyone okay?
I bet that did some damage to the car.
Was it about something serious?
I hope she wasn't cheating with you at least.
Has it rained more often there than usual?
My yard has too actually. I wonder if it's due to more sun and more rain across the board
Did you ask them why? 
I would let things cool down for awhile and maybe they will have a change of heart. If not _comma_ apologize and see if that helps.
Sounds fun! What area did you have in mind_comma_ since you're already about to make the reservations
I bet! I've been to South Carolina several times. It's very beautiful there_comma_ and I'm sure you'll have fun
Was it a nice steal or a mean one?
Did you ask her about it?
oh no! That's scary! What do you think it is?
I'm sorry to hear that. I wish I could help you figure it out
Oh no! I hate to hear that he is hurt. But you shouldn't feel bad. It happens all the time. Kids will find a thousand ways to get hurt. 
My daughter is the same way! She gets bumped and scraped way more than my son_comma_ but she just goes right on. How is your son today?
i know how you feel... My best friend lives in a different country
not often at all. I saw her in 2011. we skype but it's not the same
I do that all the time. I can remember lots of times watching things from long ago.
I still play some games from the 1990s.
That must be very hard on you_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that. It must be very scary to experience.
Is there anything that can be done from a medical standpoint? 
Woo hoo! Congratulations! You must be super proud of yourse.f
What classes did you take?
Which math class did you take? 
Oh okay. I bet psychology was an interesting course.
That sucks. 
My kids are taking a nap now. The run this house lol
awesome! My husband had an interview as well. I hope both of our spouses get a job
I hope so! My husband was so nervous but he thinks it went well
Ugh_comma_ oh no.... is there someway you can have the person who sent it call the gift card to see what can be done? 
True true_comma_ well im glad they are looking into it for you. I hope they find it! 
Where are you going ?
Oh_comma_ that should be nice. I hope you have fun.
Wow... I would have been as well! Was anyone injured? 
Bummer but glad the people are okay! 
Oh no... are they in trouble? lol 
Maybe tomorrow morning you should wake them up super early as a surprise. :p
That was nice. 
Wives are awesome like that.
how fun! I bet she is good at it
wow_comma_ that's amazing. She is very talented. I would never be able to do that
oh no. o'm sorry to here that.
I hope you do too. It will work out in the end.
that's great. family is important
That's good. Some parents can be old fashioned.
Well_comma_ that's nice to hear. Is it their first marriage.
Try not to approach it like that_comma_ but do look for the right man.
How long have you been in school?
That's so great to hear. Are you going to graduate with honors?
What are you going to school for?
Do you want to be a lawyer or joing the police?
Oh no. Did you laugh or cry?
ITs fine. It happens
Cool. I am too. 
Hopefully next year. I've been in my apartment 5 years now
Good memories I hope.
That will do it. I get that some too.
Thats great!  It's awesome you are doing things for yourself.
That really is good news you should be feeling proud.
So whats next.. for your goals?
Oooh you will probably get there in no time.
Congratulations! I hope you lovve it
I hope so. It really sucks when you hate your job lol
Oh no. I thought kids didn't do that anymore
They ruined it for you. Halloween is my favorite holiday
Yep. I do a theme with my kids. Were were all comic villains last year
Are you the only one who lives in your apartment?
Have you considered setting up a structure with mandatory chores?
At reading or in general?
Do I need to steal one of her toys to teach her a lesson?
Well_comma_ I don't see the point in that.
At least you've got work here though.
Ohhh I feel you! lol... Mine isnt quite school aged yet but I was just saying today I cant wait. ( ha ha! ) How old are they? 
Does it get any easier as they get older? please tell me yes... 
That sucks... what are they doing? 
I know there probably isnt much you can do. :/ I hope it gets better... 
I love Christmas!
Seeing my kids open their gifts. I never make it to Christmas because I'm so excited to see them lol
I never get anything but that's fine
Yes it has! Even NY is extremely hot. What state are you in? 
Wooo. I am in Florida. I feel you. 
Sounds like the right things to do.
yeah_comma_ you're hungry...it's there.
Wow! How much was it?
I'd be mad too. You don't think she will share it with you
I never win either.
Oh wow.  Have you ever been married?
Do you have any children?
Wow.  That must be a lot of work.
I am sorry.  You sound like a really hard worker.
Do you have any plans as to where to go.
Think I've talked to you before_comma_ still hope you have a nice vacation.
Me too. I plan like 10 years ahead of time. How far in advance do you plan? 
Better safe than sorry 
I definitely suggest a nice home-cooked meal_comma_ it's usually a lot healthier than take out.
I understand_comma_ it's hard to find the time for everything sometimes.
15. Wow. That has to be tough.
I hope it doesn't get to bad for him.
Why do you say that? Are you a man or woman?
Everything happens for a reason. I was single until I was 29. I met the right one on a dating app. No shame in an app.
I went through 4 dates and then I met the one I am with. Try again! I have been with for clsoe to 2 years.
Good luck! Sometimes single is nice tho. 
Oh I am doing the same thing but for a different reason.
Thats wonderful news!  Did you make a nice profit?
Yea_comma_ between kids_comma_ cleaning_comma_ and everything else_comma_ its hard to stay energetic
Yea_comma_ then you hae to do it all yourself
I love that feeling_comma_ though I don't experience it often.  Why did it make you happy?
Oh that's good!  I remember waiting for those refunds when I was in school. 
That's always good news.  Were you worried something was wrong?
I'm guessing all those small concerns turned out well if everything turned out fine.
A hurricane? That sounds awful! Where is it_comma_ I haven't heard anything about one_comma_ I live in Florida. 
I better check_comma_ its better to be prepared then dead!!
Ewwwwww.  Kinda gross.  My cats used to do that too.
Me either.  Only serial killers like dead animals.
Its always better to rely on ourselves. Im happy for you! 
Honestly_comma_ its during our worst times we realize our true strength. Good for you. 
Been there. Done that.
It does. Then she turns 13 and is a brick wall lol. 
I understand that! Mine has one too_comma_ and it gets frustrating!
Yeah of course_comma_ I just dont even talk to him when he has them on. I gave up
LOL that is sorta funny though.  I can just picture this.
Maybe you should sneak over and mow it for him when he isn't home.
You wouldn't believe that's happened to me too!
i was 22. Registering for college classes and I was freaking out so bad_comma_ they just told me to come back the next day. I didn't go back
Really? I tried to use hulu once but it wasnt for me. You going to watch it tonight? 
I dont like scary either im a baby i guess 
That's good! It's always nice to have friends you can rely on
I wish I had that kind of relationship. I left most of that when I moved :(
Oh no. I
That's great. I wonder how many hikers actually keep a first aid kit?
Thats wonderful.  Are you pregnant?
Wow how much longer?
oh_comma_ it's good. Take your all belongings without fail. Hope you'll have good journey. 
sure. Have a good trip.
I hate shots for babies. Why do they have to get so many?!?!?!
You can tell they are mad at you too for letting it happen. I hate ir
yum sounds good whats your fav toppings? 
:o uhhh oh you had to pick them off 
Cool. I hope you get it. Is it a lot more pay?
I've never gotten a promotion at any job. But I've never wanted more responsibility 
Awesome. Are you going to s chool or your children? 
Right i work from home so i feel you 
Did he come through?
That's great I have a couple of friends like that
That would certainly make me upset too_comma_ was it your neighbors?
Very annoying_comma_ I would consider getting the police to pay a visit even.
She probably understood.
If she is a really good friend then she did. Dont worry about it.
Sorry to hear that. Is there any chance you two can patch up again?
Oh_comma_ then try to keep busy yourself so you don't feel alone.
That is a shame.  I hear that is happening a lot in schools today.
They don't have time for all that.  They are trying to teach.
Did something go wrong with the interview?
Competition is tough these days. For whatever reason_comma_ that job wasn't meant to be and you'll find your perfect fit soon.
That's really annoying. Did you send it back to the kitchen?
I think you'll probably be fine but_comma_ that dosen't mean your lunch isn't ruined.
Are you going to re-order from some where else?
You could always just go the sushi route from now on.  You can't udner cook it.
Congratulations
That's great. Some people aren't so lucky. They die at a job they hate
That's awesome. I hope you love it
Were you able to get it off of your shoe?
Keep working at it_comma_ you'll get it all. Try ice on it to harden the gum first.
Its really hot where I live.  I'm ready for it to be over.  Its 100f out side right now and very humit.
I guess its different if you live where it gets cold during the winter.
You continues a series on Netflix I hope and not the other thing
You shouldn't have. What happened?
Thats nice.  She's becoming a teenager full force!
I am sure she will be fine.  We all made it through.
Why were you nervous?
Oh I see. How did it go?
I bet you were.
That just means more food for you. That sounds like a win to me.
Tell them the next time they need to get up if they want good food_comma_ too.
That has been happening a lot lately.  Everyone in the US seems to be getting wet.
Im so sorry you got rained out.  Do you at least get a refund?
Whoa_comma_ that's scary! Did you freak out?
I can imagine. Did it look like a stereotypical ghost_comma_ like Casper?
Oh no_comma_ I'm so sorry to hear that_comma_ were you close?
Oh that's so sweet_comma_ I wish I kept in touch with my family too
Cool. Was it an all nighter?
That's my kind of party.
that's really good! Have you been driving distracted when you uber?
oh okay sorry_comma_ i was just a little distracted about my car accident the other day.
this semi pushed us off the road I'm still a little freaked out about it
Well that's nothing compared to what could have happened.
Who else was in the car
What happened?
I'm sorry to hear that. That's awful.   How long were you together?
You must not have been speeding too much!
Were you nervous being pulled over? I've never been pulled over myself.
That's great_comma_ how did the interview end up going?
That's always great_comma_ better be be over prepared. So_comma_ did you get the job offer?
Oh no! They are terrifying little dogs aren't they?
They're really loud too actually_comma_ they bark a whole lot more than other dogs
Oh I totally hear you there. You cant just like be yourself_comma_ and not that being yourself is bad or anything
Yeah me either. Once people get to know me its fine but usually people dont like me when they first meet me. idk!
You still consider them your friends after that?
That's messed up.
Wow_comma_ that's absurd.. Of course it's the ONE that's impotrant.
That's always so awful.. It's too bad it wasn't something you bought with a credit card and could just dispute it..
I can see why you'd be happy about it_comma_ I mean you doubled up even with it being a small amount! Where did you buy it?
Wow_comma_ I mean everything happens for a reason.. That's great!
oh gosh_comma_ that's horrible. i can't imagine how you feel. i would be so heartbroken
you don't deserve it! nobody deserves it
it happens. i hate being late
oh gosh lol that's so funny. 
I am a pretty trusting person also. 
It's okay to trust_comma_ but always be cautious too.
That really sucks! Have you put up any posters to help you find him?
Well I hope you find him. Hopefully nothing bad happened to him.
Oh yeah those lines can be super long. What did you do?
Oh no that is terrible. What happened to all your things?
Oh no_comma_ that's horrible.. July is not the time for that! Do you have someone ready to come out and fix it yet?
That's good to hear_comma_ how hot is it where you are?
Oh man_comma_ good for you! I would have caved for sure. Pizza is my life
So true. I always eat it all. I really can't control myself so better not to even start. Good on you
Wow thats awesome_comma_ what kind of car did you get?
That was a good choice_comma_ did you consider any other makes/models ?
Don't blame you there i remember by kid getting his first shots.  He was so upset and wouldnt stop crying.
I got lucky there he was fine after we got him away from the doctors office and got him his very treat.
Yay!!! Congrats! That's so exciting_comma_ i'm really happy for you
You will! I believe in you. Just go with a flow and take one day at a time. Your baby will love you so much
You should read the instructions before you start.. You need to work off the prompts.. But hello_comma_
Yes. I did go to college_comma_ but I did not complete it.
I hate when that happens!
I'm happy for you. I have been in that situation before.
Well_comma_ even going by yourself you can always have a good time_comma_ especially with alcohol involved! Did you end up having fun?
That's when you drink more and talk to everyone around you and make a good time for yourself!
Uh oh.. Definitely not where you wanna go if you don't like clowns! Were you afraid while you were there?
That's terrible! Did you make it through the entire show?
Awh man_comma_ that stinks.. I never watched it before.. I'm assuming you really liked it?
Yep why is it always with the good tv shows that it happens!?
Congrats! Hard work really does pay off.
I can only imagine how excited you must of been when you got the promotion.
There are a bunch of people who really don't! I don't get really why people are afraid of it_comma_ though.
Yeah_comma_ I guess I can see why that would frighten some people.. Nightlights work wonders!
Yes_comma_ I think everyone was shocked! The real question is_comma_ were you happy?
That's awesome.. Hopefully they win again in the future!
Did you enjoy it?
I bet that was fun and relaxing
That sounds definitely terrifying! Did you figure out what it was?
Hmm.. I guess it is still July so it makes SOME sense at least! Did you ever confront them?
That is great.
That is great_comma_ your studying paid off.
In what college did he go?
Oh_comma_ that's awesome! I am glad he made it!
I suppose I have. Why did you go to Texas?
Oh no! Were you all by yourself?
ohh! that is frighting. Didn't you scare?
Yeah! I am glad he didn't bite you or something!
Cool. Where are you going?
I've been to Cozumel. It was lots of fun
It is nice. School can be very exciting.
Are they happy to go back to school?
Why were they fun
Yeah_comma_ its not safe at all
Yeah. I know that feeling._comma_ although I had to buy my own.
I know. What kind of car was it
Parents can be awesome sometimes. Do you still play baseball?
Who's your favorite team?
Thats a great way to start
good luck going forward
Why would you do that
I guess we all were though
I'm sorry to hear that. Losing family is always tough
I recently lost my grandmother. I thought I wouldn't get through it at all.
What did you get
I understand_comma_ time is important
That's awesome. Was he the first in your family?
Did he get a god job?
Wao_comma_ how did you felt? did you work hard in that project?
IWhat was your project about? it was for school or something?
Where did you guys go?
That's cool! I thought they'd only be around for Halloween.
I hope you get it also! What type of position is it?
That's great! how soon until you hear back?
Well ... I put myself in your place and I admire you because it is something very emotionally tense
Now you must take the corrective so that it does not happen to you anymore
Oh no. What happened?!
I haven't tried uber for important places. Not I know to be weary. So sorry to hear that.
Oh no. Did you lose your job then?
Maybe they can put you in a different department.
Oh wow. Are you a parent?
You must be proud.
That's great!
That is a real blessing. Being debt free is gonna be sweet!
I'm glad to hear that. If you can get through that_comma_ you can get through anything together.
What matters is that you both learned from it.
Oh wow. That is not something you hear everyday!
Your friend must really like the woman. 
I'm sure you are going to miss her.
Will you be able to communicate through social media?
What situation?
Oh wow. Kid is crazy!
Oh man_comma_ that must be a horrible feeling.
There is always next year champ. Im sure you'll try harder next time.
That's so bad. You must be feeling bad
I am surprised at their behavior. Did you ask for a refund?
That is quite an achievement! How did you do it?
I bet their were struggles and you learned a lot. Do you have any tips for me?
That's exciting! How old is she?
Oh my god. She's so little. I hope she'll enjoy it.
Oh no_comma_ that's awful. When did this happen?
I hope the worst didn't happen to them_comma_ that's so sad.
Wow that's really nice. Are you going to wear it?
It must've been a great guy.
Wow nice! What are you going to do with it?
It is a lot of money. Take your time deciding on what to do with it.
That's good news.  Is her cat microchipped?
How long has the cat been missing?
I bet that was scary! Did you like it?
Were you ever scared? 
Are you ok?
Is your vehicle damaged?
Did you try to find who it belonged to?
I understand_comma_ I hope you do something special with it then! It's always exciting to get a little extra cash_comma_ even only $20.
Oh no! Are they even allowed to do that?
That really sucks. I hate how employers expect us to work to death.
Oh wow. Glad that person helped you out there. 
Glad to hear there's still some good people out there.
Was that difficult? And is it your extended family_comma_ or your immediate family?
I know that can be really tough. Sometimes_comma_ though_comma_ it can strengthen communication -- hopefully they've been able to visit?
That sounds kind of suspicious.
Oh no. Did anything happen?
How do you respond to the girls who are hitting on you?
Seems like you might be enjoying the attention.
How come?
That's definitely concern. Is there no more room for advancement at  your current job?
I hate to say it but_comma_ I think that ship has sailed.  She's either dead or not your girlfriend anymore. 
Women_comma_ amirite? 
Oh no. I'm so sorry to hear that and glad people at your church are there for you.
hahaha must be some really great cookers. How many kids do you have?
That is so tough. I always feel bad when people have a hard time conceiving because it was so easy for me.
I have 4 kids. I wish you all the best of luck and will pray for you. Kids are so much fun. Mine are all almost grown now.
That sounds very exciting -- if nervewracking! How did it go for him? (And you ;-))
That is the *best* feeling seeing hard work pay off! You much have been so happy for and proud of him!
Oh no what kind of damage was done?
Did you tell her? She may want you to go ahead and get it fixed.
Must've felt really nostalgic.
Do you get to see your mom often?
That sucks.  If it makes you feel even slightly better_comma_  the dumbest_comma_ most imcompent coworker I have makes more than me... because you know.. nepotism.
Yeah_comma_ its infuriating.
Oh no. I'm so sorry.
I hope time will heal_comma_ and they don't lose hope.
Why did you cheat on her? 
Sometimes_comma_ it feels good to get revenge
How did you get the raise?
What did you do that got you the promotion? 
thats great it always nice to be encourage.  Really like it when my co workers do it
glad to hear it.
you are such a nice person.  Hopefully you helped.
That is a bummer.  On the bright side you probably won't do that again!
That is awesome!  It is nice to know people can be fair!
Sounds terrible_comma_ how did she get in the accident?
What did she say after waking up?
that's awkward where was it?
from what you have told i cant go there what else did you see 
Are you sick? What happened?
That's terrible. I hope you get some rest.
That sounds like a happy homecoming! Or was it bittersweet?
That's a great feeling. Knowing you *can* go home again ;-) Hopefully they can come visit you_comma_ too!
Oh that's nice! Most people don't adopt older dogs
Mostly medical. But_comma_ also that you most likely won't have long to make a bond_comma_ play_comma_ etc. It would be mostly care
Oh no. Did you explain it to him?
You'll be more careful next time. Everyone makes mistakes.
Why do you usually bring him along?
How far away was it? 
Oh man! I'm so sorry! Is there any part of the season you can still enjoy? 
Do your parents feel terrible about that? (Not that you want them to....I just imagine they'd be pretty devastated to know that's why a holiday was ruined for you.) On the other hand -- I LOVE New Years!
Why did he lie?
What did he say for the reason?
Why is she the love of your life?
How does she complete you?
Were you scared?
What movies do you enjoy instead?
That is nice of her_comma_ did you have fun?
Who was all there?
oooh really do ghosts exist 
i used to but nowadays i don't what else
Who won instead?
Did you bet on the game? 
That is amazing! I went to college for a few years_comma_ never ended up graduating.
I studied hard for a while_comma_ but in the end it was just too much fun to party every weekend.
That isn't nice.
You should not do that anymore.
Can you retake it?
That's too bad. All you can do is try harder next time.
Did you say something?
Did you say anything to the clerk?
Did you say something to the clerk?
Was there damage?
Was there anyone else around?
Did it turn out ok?
What was the puzzle of?
hahaha i can see hoe students laughed at you
ahw that was good
What about 3?
I have never been to Asia.
something wrong with your meal or what
can you kick an innocent dog for nothing
That isn't very nice.
What about 4?
Were you afraid or thrilled or both?
Were you in the water?
That is terrible news.
How did you do it?
That is wonderful! I actually won the lottery once myself and it changed my life for a bit.
oh no! That is terrible. I didn't give anyone any money either. 
That must be a good feeling.
I use to go to church when I was little.
Was it something that you could ignore?
What did you do?
That sucks. I am sorry for your loss.
Maybe you should get a new one.
Happiness comes and goes. it could change at any time.
As long as you take care of it_comma_ and use it the right way it will last you forever.
Oh_comma_ that does not seem very nice.
Yes_comma_ she and I have a bond that will be unbreakable.
Why did you think that?
What makes you qualified?
Oh no! I did that last month. I still feel bad. Get them a gift to say sorry.
Give him a call too. It is a bit more personal.
I always try and order my food and get it delivered.
There a bunch of apps that let you buy food online_comma_ you should check it out!
That is a great idea for when emergencies happen!
Yes_comma_ that is a smart plan. Knowing that we cannot foresee the future_comma_ it is a good idea to be prepared.
Oh no_comma_ where to? That is hard.
Oh no_comma_ where to? That is hard.
Well_comma_ at least there is sand!
Why is that? Are you scared of something in the water?
I was pleased and shocked at the same time_comma_ I will take it!
Oh no! I'm so sorry!
That is not fun. Hopefully it will not be too hard.
I expect that too_comma_ but it is not always the case.
Yes_comma_ you do. You can do it!
That's great to hear. Did you have to wait a long time to get it?
Oh_comma_ well I am very happy for you. I bet you were celebrating when you heard the good news!
After the interview was over I though it went very well. I am so confident I will get the job any day now!
That's awesome! I love dog sitting no matter the occasion!
That sounds like a good way to have fun and get some exercise!
Awesome! I've never been able to sit that long_comma_ so getting really good at video games is hard for me
That's neat. I wish I had your motivation for...well...everything else in life.
What is that?
Nice_comma_ how much did you get for it?
That is so thoughtful of him_comma_ did you guys catch a ball? 
I am sure it was! :) 
tell me more about this
but i would less satisfied
Tell him to get out and do something! That must be frustrating. 
Its hard being a parent... but i am sure you are doing it right! 
I love peruvian food! What did you make?
That green sauce with the cilantro and the jalepenos is the best! What is lomo?
Yum! I have all the ingredients for the chicken_comma_ I might make that now instead of the bbq chicken_comma_ thanks for the idea. 
Oh wow_comma_ sorry to hear_comma_ that was really rude of her.
Some people can take things so far. I hate it when they do that.
I am the type of person that gets what I have to buy and get out of the store. 
proud parent right _comma_ do you miss her during the year ?
one day my child will make me proud like that
thats a lot of kids_comma_ god bless
Going good...what's up with you.
So how did  you do? Did the hard work pay off for you?
Holy cow. I hate when that happens. It happens a lot here since I live near the ocean. How did it end up?
Wow_comma_ how lucky. How did you end up thanking that person?
Where are you moving to?
I love California.
Cool who were they up against? 
Nice! 
why would you do that
I am not sure I get it
I love it when teachers are down to earth and easy to get along with. What did you like most about him?
That's pretty cool. Do you guys still keep in touch?
Sorry to hear that. I hope you've had good teachers since then.
I'm sorry to hear that. Did something happen to make you miss them?
Oh no! That is hard_comma_ I have the same issue. How far away did you move?
Omg! I am the same way... i always end up putting my list down while shopping. Where are you going? 
Thats so kind of them! 
oh man_comma_ i'm sorry to hear that! We all make mistakes though_comma_ so it's okay. don't be hard on yourslef
it's okay though_comma_ i'm sure you learned from your mistake
i know how you feel. I'm sorry to hear you're going through this. I just got food stamps so i can buy food for me and my son
I encourage you to apply for it no matter what
Its a good time to jog right now in the morning. good for you! 
I know it does I am right in FL! I dont jog_comma_ I work out but running isnt my thing. 
What kind of risk are you taking?
Yikes_comma_ that's stressful. How big is the family?
I am so sorry. You must be heartbroken.
How long was he part of your life?
What did you do?
Did the dog bark at him?
That sounds terrible. Sorry to hear that. What exactly happened?
That's the worst_comma_ when you personally know someone that treated you badly. I hope things turn out better for you. 
oh no.. are you upset? 
awh thats good it turned out well afterall 
Yeah_comma_ I think most people feel that way_comma_ but it's still a valid feeling. How did it end up?
that's great to hear! Did you have any cool teachers or make any new friends?
I bet that was a little scary
Oh well_comma_ I am sure most people forgot about it quickly
Thats awesome! Im glad you persisted because that is so important these days_comma_ not being able to swim is a real danger!
Yes_comma_ sounds like your doing a great job with the little guy!
Oh no_comma_ did it take you a long time to figure out what the issue was?
Dogs can be a little squeamish when it comes to that sort of thing. I wouldn't feel bad_comma_ it could happen to anyone!
I know you are over the moon. What did you have?
Enjoy every minute with him. Time goes fast when they are little.
That is horrible_comma_ so sad.
Yes_comma_ fire prevention shouldn't be that hard.
Wow! I'm so envious! How long ago did you buy it?
Makes sense. when you know what you want_comma_ you should go for it. Well_comma_ I'm happy for you. I'm far away from being able to do that.
I bet you had a wonderful time together
how fun! Where did you guys go?
I bet
That is good to hear_comma_ less weight the better
why would you do that
The loud roars also make my dog shake and run to the basement
My dog never used to do that_comma_ it was only just recently that he started doing that.
Oh no_comma_ was anoyone hurt?
That is good news_comma_ I hope your car is ok.
You must have been so proud of their hard work.
Was it a large graduating class?
Wow_comma_ I am glad you got help_comma_ that could have been a lot worse
That is so sweet of him_comma_ those are the people we need more of in the world
how was the experience?
It was good you got over the fear_comma_ do you ride roller coasters more now?
Oh my gosh_comma_ that's terrible. How did that happen
That's one of my worst fears when I drive to my girlfriend's parents' house. So everything ended up being okay_comma_ though?
what do you think your score was?
Ah thats a good score.  When i took the LSATs about 15-16 years ago I received a 156 i believe.  Where do you hope to go to school?
Good luck!
I too was surprised.  To leave the team again sort of upset me.
He is a legend in the making
I feel the same way. The times you spend with family should be cherished forever.
I agree_comma_ be grateful for those in your life because they help you become a better person.
Congratulations?  How much did you win?
Wow.  Now you can spoil yourself
He already left for the Lakers.
He technically is from Akron not Cleveland.
That is sweet of him_comma_ marriage can be tough at first_comma_ so at least he is trying
That is true_comma_ marriage is great in a vaccuum_comma_ but life pops the bag sometimes
Was it a long campaign?
I bet it did
Why is that?
Lebron isnt a saint though
how did you do?
were you able to retake it?
That is great_comma_ did you spend it on anything cool?
That is smart as well_comma_ future you will appreciate that!
I am happy that you have someone to share your life with.
Keep the faith that it will continue.
That's seriously impressive. Sounds like a lot of work_comma_ though. Hope it all works out. Are you nervous?
Well_comma_ you sound confident. And applying and getting in is one of the toughest steps_comma_ so I'm sure you'll do fine.
Wow. That is great.  Not everyone can say that.
Most struggle in their first year.  That is amazing that you did so well.
I am an older student too so I hope things go well for me in school.
Oh no_comma_ did the relative say what happened? That sounds fishy.
It's an easy mistake to make_comma_ we're supposed to trust family_comma_ you know?
Thats great.  I love taking the kids to Disneyworld.  What do you want to see most?
Yea you wont be disappointed.  Its wonderful there.
I am sure you were happy
All that hard work was worth it I am sure
Making a change can be hard. Did you take the offer?
It's always best to do nothing if your not sure.
were you able to do any extra credit to bring up the grade?
That stinks. There's always next time!
Oh_comma_ very interesting. I'm not a fan of the owner either. Why do you feel that way_comma_ though?
That's a fair point. But Lebron James is different_comma_ and probably seeks to try to really control the team he is on_comma_ so that can be difficult too
how long have you two known eachother?
I think you just need to give it time. Hopefully she will come around.
What were you thinking? Have you been thinking it over for a long time?
Was she keeping him in her classroom? I can see how that can be a lot of work.
That's nice. Hard to find nowadays.
I know. I wish things were better!
I do too honestly_comma_ I used to play all these fun games with our neighbors late summer nights_comma_ it was amazing_comma_ but I took it for granted
I hear you there_comma_ that is the worst part!
I remember those games too. What kinds did you play? My favorite was flashlight tag.
Ghost in the graveyard was a blast! I can't believe I forgot that one. It sounds like we both had great childhoods.
I get that_comma_ I am not sure how some of these people can afford the places they go!
Yeah_comma_ that is not me at all_comma_ I barely post anything to people online
How exciting for you. What kind of car is it?
That was so generous of them.
That is not nice! People do that all the time as long as the person they tell is closer to them
Everyone believes that of course_comma_ but I believe you_comma_ people make mistakes
Ugh I remember those days! All the shopping_comma_ making sure to look good for the first day! good times
Me too_comma_ I am looking forward to winter and christmas_comma_ much better in my opinion!
congratulations. marry her
then maybe you should cheat.
I am sure you are_comma_ that sounds bad
There are just bad people out there
That takes a lot of strength to be able to do that. A lot of people would just break down instead of trying to help however they can.
Good for you_comma_ I'm sure your dad is so very thankful for you.
Yikes_comma_ did anything out of the ordinary happen?
That is weird_comma_ sorry to hear that_comma_ paying more money is never fun at all
Wow that's awesome.
Why so surprised>
I know exactly what you mean.
It makes it hard to communicate though.
I am sorry to hear that_comma_ how did it end between you?
That makes sense_comma_ sometimes things are just not meant to be
that is no good_comma_ I am sorry that happened to you
It happens I suppose_comma_ maybe there is some sort of refund policy where you bought it from
WOW! Why do people have to be violent... ugh 
right me either. its too bad but glad you are thinking right! 
Oh no. Not another Lebron story.
I know. He is a great player though.
thats nice.
sorry to hear that.
Where are you headed to?
Oh_comma_ well that sounds like it will be a ton of fun_comma_ I hope all goes well!
Oh no! How old were you at the time?
That's like a bad dream scenario. Better to be a little kid though_comma_ even if kids are mean.
Please don't care about those people. Try to be true to yourself. World will recognize you one day.  
Exactly. You're right. Ignore them. 
Have you been married a long time?
I know that had to hurt. But forgive her and let her make it up to you.
Dads can be strange like that sometimes. Was he trying to be malicious about it_comma_ or just having fun?
What did he used to do?
Why did things end between you?
Oh_comma_ yeah I understand that_comma_ it is the same way with my girlfriend now
I was just saying the same thing.
I'm only 34 and a lot of my old friend are dead.
Was your previous neighbor good at least?
Ah_comma_ well at least you can only meet or exceed expectations!
Why did it make you feel awkward?
Oh_comma_ well I am sure the date was just happy you were there!
That's a shame - I'm glad that you've got friends now though. Why was that?
I thikn lots of people are shy until they find where they belong.
i bet you did_comma_ did you want a boy instead of a girl?
That is a good mindset_comma_ I wish you the best of luck with that!
how did it happen?
how_comma_ did you get into trouble?
I understand that_comma_ he seemed to seal his own fate there_comma_ but still sad
Potentially_comma_ he seemed a bit deadset_comma_ but we do not know too much all in all
how much do they run?
damn.. how times have changed..
Was it Roseanne?
Me too. What show are you talking about?
That can be a hard situation to deal with. Any chance of moving?
Good for you. Just hang on best you can until your in a better place.
Aww_comma_ that is so sweet! I'm sure you were very happy
Oh yeah_comma_ definitely! She seems like a very good girlfriend to do that for you. Sounds like y'all have a good future ahead.
Oh no... maybe you can get it fixed asap so no one will be upset? 
I am sure it was glad its fixed 
How does it hold up now?
well that is good_comma_ that seems rare!
The results for what?
Well_comma_ best of luck_comma_ I am sure you did awesome!
Childhood is a boon and it never be taken again. But everyone wishes to do so. 
Me too. Try to spend time with kids. We can get into their life for sometime.
well theres only one way to find out!
yea_comma_ everyone probably does at one point or another.
Oh no! I would have too. Did you find him?
Oh... Interesting. A hole under the fence? I'm sorry to hear that.
thats amazing.. im happy for him too.. i bet you are proud 
thats to be expected but you seem like a caring person 
Wow_comma_ that's terrifying.get really big? Did it 
That is crazy lucky. Well_comma_ I'm glad everything ended up okay.
Oh that sounds very exciting! What kind of car?
That is so awesome! Happy for you!
That is nasty_comma_ did it get on anyone else? that would not be fun
That is so nasty_comma_ I am glad I was not there
wow ! that's really awesome. What kind of car did you get?
what? that's absolutely horrble
Shock? Uh oh_comma_ what happened? Is everything okay?
Ohhh... That makes more sense. Well_comma_ congratulations. That's a defining point in people's lives. I hope you have a great experience.
im sorry.. distance sucks. luckily you guys have skype! 
I know because sometimes technology doesnt work the way we want it too.. i hope you get to be together again soon. 
how did it go?
how did you make up for it?
Did you find him?
How long has it been? I am so sorry. That must be so difficult.
No!!! gross... did you flip? 
i am sure it wasnt 
Hah... I have a teenage sister. I can agree. But they can have their good moments. I hope for the best for you.
With the way you sound_comma_ I'm sure you'll have the patience and the wisdom to raise her the right way through the teenage years anyway.
Congrats!!! Do you already have a job lined up? 
thats so awesome good for you 
Don't we all!  Work is often times one of the most stressful things in life.
Where do you suppose you would like to take a break at?
That's a large amount of money!
He is a Superbowl caliber QB_comma_ so I guess he deserves it.

My anxiety would have been having anxiety - so I feel you... hows the dog doing today? 
Awh.. if shes okay today she will be fine! 
I bet you'll be fine if you work hard enough. What language is it?
I feel that way sometimes but it's the best way to learn_comma_ and it only gets easier!
That is so sad.. im sorry! ugh... i hope you can find peace.

What happened?
At least you feel bad about it?

thats a good choice
Eek!  I hate spiders!  Did you kill it?
Oh no!  That's too bad.  Now you will have to keep an eye out for it!
Did it go well for you then?
It's great when it works out that way_comma_ I hate presenting.
You should take it somewhere then
You need to save up then
Did he give you tips for getting the best deal?
That's really sweet_comma_ I'm happy for you
I feel that_comma_ sometimes I feel lucky to survive single days!
Why this one in particular?
That is great_comma_ which one?
When do you start?
So what happened?
Congratulations!
I am glad to hear that_comma_ it seems like a lot of work
that is wht i have heard_comma_ i hope it is that way for me
It can happen.Were you better prepared for the next one?
It can be a hard lesson to learn but will make you a better student.
My cousin bought a really pretty shirt that I had been wanting
No I can but I didn't want her to have it and not me.
No I can but I didn't want her to have it and not me.
I understand.. i wish life could be eaiser! Im sorry.. whats going on? 
sounds like a lot of stress... i hope things change for you VERY soon! 
Oh no_comma_ I hope you feel better soon. Do you want to talk about it?
I'm so sorry. Have you tried reading Rainbow Bridge_comma_ that could provide some comfort.
wouldnt that be cool and your bestfriend would be kevin 
yup
Why is that?
What did she do for your birthday?
I understand that completely_comma_ I still have a bit of time to wait
I get that_comma_ sometimes it is not in the cards though
Did you get in?
When do you start?
That is nice of him_comma_ that is a good dad right there!
oh_comma_ I am sorry to hear that he passed away...
How do they help
They sound like good people
Me too_comma_ I dislike heat but I love the leisure
Me too_comma_ that made summer great as a kid!
That is good you met your girlfriend_comma_ where did you meet?
Where did you go to college.
Nothing wrong with that.
No_comma_ only one extra day isn't bad.
IS that a real thing?
Wow. The first one is so old now.
That's amazing!  How much did you win and what did you buy with it?
Smart move!  Good for you for deciding to use it responsibly.
That's so sweet! Always a special moment_comma_ how old is she?
I bet you are so proud!
I can understand that. My husband went to a friends to work on his car. I'm home with 5 kids!
Ha ha! No loneliness here. I think the biggest worry is craziness.
oh how sad_comma_ how did you lose your car?. Public transportation is not every one's cup of tea..
you guy's will get back everything you have lost. It is difficult for travel as you said
oh no_comma_ that is unfortunate. are you alright?
wow_comma_ you might just have bad luck
i would just take an uber from now on if i were you.
Thats sounds so delicious.  How did it turn out?
Did everyone else enjoy your new found passion for cooking?
That's always a great holiday. What did you do to celebrate?
Sounds like a great time! Did you celebrate with family or friends?
I'm super bummed out. I worked really hard for this promotion and I ended up not getting it.
I'm not sure_comma_ my boss won't return my request for a meeting emails.
I'm excited personally_comma_ I guess you have to like your school and what you're studying.
I hate writing papers too. That's why I am an engineering major. Lol its still pretty hard though.
I bet you are excited for that
Yeah_comma_ it's always hard to leave in those situations. Are you flying to see her?
I live near the beach_comma_ too! It really is great. Although I've been out of town for a while_comma_ so I haven't been to it yet this summer. I'm glad you got to go there.
Only thing I'm not wild about is dealing with cleaning up afterwards.
Why weren't you able to do it?
Oh man that sucks_comma_ do you feel bad about it?
I'm sure if you apologize he'll understand at least a little. Were you just really busy or something?
Sometimes people say things they don't mean when their angry. Maybe you should just let it go.
Well_comma_ you both have the same blood_comma_ so I would advise just to let bygones be bygones.
thats awesome_comma_ love the positive vibes. good for you! 
good paying job and keeps you active! 
Whoa... that's awesome. I love hearing that. Can you tell me about them?
Absolutely. I'm glad you're experiencing that. Me on the other hand_comma_ I'd be worried that I wasn't good enough for them. But I'm sure things will work out for you.
Yes it is... when can you see her again? 
well i hope you two get to spend a lot of time together when she comes up 
That sounds like trouble. What exactly is going on?
Dang! I'm not a parent_comma_ but I have siblings who have done the same (and of course I've done it to my parents_comma_ too). Any idea what you're going to do?
Well then It's time to dominate. LOL 
I'm working now. Enjoy your own time and also be responsible to your juniors. 
That's such a bummer. How did he take the bad news?
Oh.. interesting. Yeah_comma_ I can't really comment on the lying_comma_ since I don't know you. But at least you went back to her to comfort her.
What are you most interested in doing?
You are absolutely right there.  If its truly a passion then you should go for it.  Life is too short to be stuck in a rut.
That's rough. Why do you think it is that you don't do more?
I guess that's good. What did you used to do for work_comma_ if you don't mind me asking?
Did you pet try to eat it?
What do you think happened to it?
I agree. However it is the circle of life and all that_comma_ and we are a part of it too.
That sucks. I can't count on my own family for favors either.
Maybe you should tell him how urgent the oil change is. Maybe he will understand.
I love cats.
I prefer dogs but I still like cats.
But kids will be busy.
Thar's true. My daughter rides the bus.
what movie was it? 
lol sounds terrible! 
Why? What happened?
ok no. I can't even.
I am sure that is a huge relief but quite expensive.
Have you ever tried to rent them or get the e-books?
Congratulations. I want that some day.
You are truly lucky
Oh I am sorry you are upset. I hope you have another opportunityto see her soon.
I am so sorry to hear that.
What do you mean
That does sound bad
Was it first place?
Congratulations. I learned to play chess in third grade.
ah me too. Hearing last season will release in April 2019
it is still such a long wait though
Oh no what happened to it??
I hope you find them! If anyone hurt it I would be furious.
That isn't right. I wouldn't of gone in.
Did you complain to HR?
I can imagine how embarrassing that must have been.  I hope you didn't have to give a speech today.
Whew. Certainly must appreciate your co-workers candidness.  It happens to all of us.
Minor surgery is still surgery.  I understand that it can be scary for anyone.
That is a surreal feeling_comma_ I understand his apprehension.  
I am sorry to hear that.  Maybe you should go see a counselor for help.
That would cause anyone to have an anxiety attack.  I don't blame you.
awh thats awesome what did you find? 
so cool! for real thats awesome 
That's great to hear! What was his major? 
Awesome. I hope he has a successful career because of it. 
I am sure that was a good day for you
I am happy for you
did you catch the person?
what did she expect you to do?
I was sad to see him leave Cleveland.
He was the face of Cleveland. 
I am so sorry to hear that. 
That must be tough.  Do you have supportive friends to help you through this tough time?
That is good_comma_ how long have you been married?
That is a long time.
Oh no. There's terrible!
I'm sorry that happened and hope you don't ever have to be in that situation ever again.
It is nice gift for bithday. That is very good.
It is even better when you don't expect it.
Wow sounds like what i just seen on the news in NC... im so sorry !! 
thats always important to have and i am glad you have that 
Has he passed or does he just live far away?
I can only imagine.  Are you close with your mother?
Oh no_comma_ that sounds super annoying! What was wrong with it?
Oh no! Sounds expensive
I'm sorry you had to go through that!
Awesome. How old is she?
Great to hear she's progressing well.  Maybe she'll be motivation for your friends son.
That is such a great feeling did you have a great time?
This heat is very dangerous hope yall was very hydrated with water to stay cool.
I remember when my aunt was studying for that.  Did you already take it?
Oh my!  I wonder if things have changed since 15 years ago.   How is the studying going?
Sorry to hear about that.
What did you do with them?
congrats. what type of job is it?
sounds like a sweet gig.
Storm? What area do you live in? Was it bad?
I'm glad you were ready for it. Is weather generally bad over there in the summer?
Well_comma_ good to see your confidence.
you'll get a very good result for your hard work. All the best for your test.
What did you do?
Did you call the police?
Oh my gosh! Congratulations!
You must be excited!
That's great.  I have a dog I rescued (she was a stray_comma_ not from a shelter)
5 years now.  I've also got a snake I've had for ~15 years
Isn't that illegal?
That is a tough situation.
Sorry. What's SEC?
Ah I see. When will the match be?
wow congrats.  how long will it take you to complete the upgrades?
well that still sounds great.
Will be a game changer.
Did the Warriors get a replacement?
Oh what happened?
They definitely surprised you then!
I hate when that happens! Were you able to get a credit for it?
That's too bad. That is a big difference.
Do you like dogs?
They are so loyal. How long did you sit the dog?
wow thats great_comma_ I hope you are able to do that
hopefully she is in good health!
What happened? I don't know of this news.
Oh my god. Is he in a position of power?
That is terrible. Did they break up?
Yes_comma_ why did he do that?
how nice of them
maybe just good people
Have you watched the dog before?
Glad you had fun. What breed is it?
best place to find one is online!
well you have to keep trying.  dont give up
Yes_comma_ I was happy he left.
I don't think he will.
I am fortunate enough to live close to mmy family so if they need something I can be there.
We may not be able to help them in the way we want to all the time but I am sure your mom knows you care a lot.
That's really good. No regrets then.
It's good that you got to spend as much time as you could. You'll always have those memories.
You gonna go on a date?
Is it totally blind or have you met before?
That's a good kid. Pretty amazing a 70s car is still going around.
I definitely need to learn how to take care of cars.
WOW! That is impressive! Did you see it happen?
I bet that was very frightening for you.
Wow. How was it?
Well_comma_ you definitely will not be going on one again any time soon.
Oh that must have been very exciting!
Haha that's how a lot of exciting events happen especially when you're really into it
What game did you watch last night?
Oh okay what teams were playing 
has she been born yet?
wonderful_comma_ congrats
Was there something that she had done in the past that made you think she wouldn't?
Maybe if you start off with a small extension_comma_ you can see how it works before you go with a longer one_comma_ kind of like increasing a credit card's limit.
Have you lied about something like that before?
I'm sorry_comma_ that must suck to get caught in a lie like that.
How come?
Ah yea_comma_ I guess he hasn't yet.
What are you waiting for to get one?
Ok then_comma_ go get one and stop complaining.
Now is a good time to get to know them.  It is surprising if they don't know you well though.
That is great.  I love hanging out with kids
Yes. It is very endearing. Our family are the first people we experience in life.
ah you are a softy for the kids I see.
That's sad. I miss most of my childhood friends as well. My best friend actually moved to Korea when I was 13.
He's half Korean_comma_ half white. His mom is from Korea and his dad works for the military_comma_ so they decided to move out there.
Definitely. If you can motivate and get on a schedule yourself_comma_ you can save a lot of money.
How long have you been training?
What's the position? Are you going to apply for it?
I'll keep my fingers crossed that you do_comma_ it sounds like that is your calling!
oh wow_comma_ what do you plan to do?
good luck
Are you sure about that? I bet you are more than average.
I think you have some unique qualities to you!
What do you have planned?
That sounds fun.
sad
thats horrible
Why is that?
Get a dog.
I bet! Does your family do a large dinner as well?
Oh wow! That sounds amazing! My family usually does something relatively small. But I'm cajun so we put a unique twist on the food!
How did you fix it?
What hotel?
what did she say?
thats awesome
How come?
What were you out for?
how many series did you watch?
Good to see your interest. I too fond of this movie.
Where did he go?
That is a long time.
That sounds like a good opportunity for you!
That is great.  It will probably be good to get out of town for a bit too.
That is great.  Sometimes kids nowadays only seem to care about themselves.
It is a valuable thing to have compassion and you should be proud of your kids
Me either_comma_ imagine being bitten by one.
The fact that they can kill you with their venom makes me uneasy.
What did he do?
Did he do it?
Oh really? What makes you say that
What are those
Is that good or bad?
Find a new roomate?
That is a very lucky thing to have. Do you have a wife and kids?
Oh that is great_comma_ I have a lot of siblings as well. I love them all!
How come?
I have never been there but I have heard that before too.  I am sorry you have to deal with that.
That is good_comma_ chance favors those who are prepared.
Do you take any mediciation?
I am glad they are healthy
I do not just a cat
That sounds great!  I wish I had a truck_comma_ they're so useful.  Does everyone ask you to help them move?
I usually hear that that is one of the problems with having a truck lol_comma_ always being the first people call to help.  Do you like it better than a car?
That sounds interesting. How far are you moving?
Oh wow that is far. Are you moving for a job?
I am sorry_comma_ that sounds rough
I have been there too_comma_ very lonely
I'm sorry to hear that.  What made them think it was you?
It's unfortunate that they would take their word over yours.  It shows how little they knew you.
I bet! Please tell me you passed it!
wow_comma_ you must be so proud of yourself! Good job!
I love to be able to help people when I can also.
I understand what you mean. I feel like a better person and know I have accomplished something by making them feel better also.
I know the feeling.  I wish we could take away the pain for our kids.
Oh my!  I have never heard that before.  I hate feeling that powerless but it is bound to happen many more times unfortunately
That sounds shady.  Did it ever get worked out?
That is very discouraging.   I am sorry you have to deal with that stress.
Oh that is terrible! Kids are so mean! What did you do?
I hope that it only gets better.
What happened to make it that way
Yeah that sucks_comma_ I have gone through that too
Yes_comma_ it's hard to see people you know and care about struggling.  Are they doing better?
That's great to hear!  I hope it stays that way and whateer troubles they had are subsided
That's great! Are you getting better at driving?
Are you going to buy a car?
Thats good to hear and do
I hate being late
How did you do?
That's great! Congrats!
That is outstanding!  I bet you are excited!
That is great news and a lot to be proud of!
That is the greatest feeling in the world_comma_ to see them smiling.
I do.  A child's laugh takes away all of life's stress.
I would be scared of that
I am not sure I am ever prepared
So why didn't you end up going?
It happens to everyone_comma_ you'll feel better about it soon
Wow_comma_ that can be stressful_comma_ Why were you happy?
Maybe she should have just quit! but i hope the best for her in the future.
indeed_comma_ the future could be bright for her.
when are they?
good luck
oh_comma_ did you lose it somewhere?
Good you got it back.
Ah_comma_ that is no good! Why didn't you get to leave early?
I know what that is like! I hate being an adult sometimes!
wow congrats_comma_ how long have you worked there?
thats cool
I feel like since the show_comma_ catfishing has decreased a little bit. It's easy to determine when someone is using fake pictures.
I have and it didn't go so well for me. I hope your experience is!
No I didn't that's pretty awesome lol...is that the show where celebrities get slimed
That's cool I remember it was a big theme in Nickelodeon. I'd be so embarrassed if I was the losing family...but I'm sure they all got paid so it was worth
Was it a surprise?
That is so cool. I bet you were happy!
I'm so sorry_comma_ what happened?
You must be missing here very much.
I saw that.  It was pretty crazy!
What are your thoughts on that?
wow thats a good feeling to have
you seem to have done a good job. congrats
Well that sounds just wonderful! What kind of entrepreneur are you?
You've sparked my curiosity on the last one haha!
Did you try talking with your supervisor 1 on 1?
Well I hope it works out for you.
That is really weird_comma_ did he actually knock the tree down and how thick was the tree?
I wonder how long it would take him to kick through a large and wide tree.
Nice did your friend give you a piece?
Cool what kind of pizza was it
That's awesome. You must be so proud of her!
She's a lucky lady!
That's a good goal!  I recommend online dating if you are trying to meet many different women!
I hear eharmony is pretty good.  I have a couple friends who have had success with it.
I know the feeling of finish finals_comma_ but not with all A's. Congrats buddy!
What are your plans afterwards?
Awww man that stinks! I thought you two were going well.
Yeah_comma_ but like 10 years of that committed time.
I agree_comma_ people who catfish need to get their priorities straight.
Exactly_comma_ looks are not the only think that matter in this world.
I sure hope they say YES with a very low interest rate. Will this be your first home?
A very exciting and scary time of life. I remember it well.
Fine_comma_ what did happen at last?
Good. Is it a bike race?
Oh no. What happened?
That's very kind of your manager. 
Being sick does stink at times. But at least your husband is there to assist when in need.
Hopefully your kids also understand and aren't being a handful.
What was the game? That happens to me all the time too_comma_ it's a treat to remember such great times.
I remember that show! And the books! But I had no idea there was a game!
have you asked them? 
they seem like not very nice people! im sorry 
What happened?
How much! Sometimes things happen like that when you really need them!
Wow_comma_ I hate when people feel like it's okay to waste other peoples time.
I'm glad you are. You deserve to work for a company that values you and your time.
aww_comma_ it's amazing how fast time flies and how quickly kids grow up.
I think like that with my kids. This sounds cliche but it's so bittersweet. 
did he lose it?
Boy_comma_ that's pretty messed up.
Ouch_comma_ seeing that news probably knocked your mood down hard.
Yeah that is like half a year of rent for me. I would be livid.
Im glad to hear it brought memories and not tears! Its hard losing a parent. 
yes we do i understand i lost both of my parents at 22 
Oh really? Is there any specific reason why?
That's great! Do you have good days often?
That's awesome! Gotta take credit for those genes haha
haha that's cool...always good to have the best of both worlds
I absolutely agree with that mind set! Pick something you're passionate about and do it with passion!
I'm a fitness enthusiast myself_comma_ and you'd be surprised how people even find reason to be negative about THAT.
About what exactly?
What did he need it for?
Why do you hide it?
Why is that considered more attractive?
It must have felt good to see him after such a long time.
A brothers bond is unbreakable. I'm glad you guys got to spend some time together. 
They are just kids_comma_ I think you should give them toys to play with and also take a pain killer
:) we have all being through the age. You will miss this stage when they finally grow to become adult
I think so! That sounds like you worked so very hard for the company!
Have you tried to talk to him?
I am glad that it is
Its nice to have things like that happen
Where was it to?? 
sounds awesome! 
I've never been in an eating contest! How much jello did you eat to win? 
What was the prize for winning? 
Wow that's kind of cool. 
Yeah_comma_ those are rough when you are so hopeful about it.
Yeah_comma_ hopefully your still looking for another internship.
I bet.. what did she pass away from? 
ugh thats terrible im sorry for your loss 
I hope she is okay
I bet_comma_ good luck though
So many people are.
I totally agree. Why do you think some people really like him though.
Did you call to complain?
Less salt is always better than to much salt on food.
I'm sorry to hear that. Why would you considering putting it on hold?
Yeah_comma_ raising kids is very tough. I do hope everything works out for you. Just find a way to keep your motivation up!
That is disappointing.  I wonder if you can see if anyone you know is doing it and they can hype you up for it.  
That is no good!
oh no... will you tell them? 
i think so its for the best 
What job?  Don't be discouraged if you don't get it though!  Keep trying!
Everything happens for a reason.  When one door closes_comma_ another one opens!
Woah! That's super scary! Did it do anything to you?
So creepy...I wouldn't be able to forget it either...
I am sorry to hear that
That isnt too far
What happened?
Is he okay now?
thats a good bond how long have you been together? 
very adorable good for you guys 
was that  the only time you stole in your life?
That was very cool of your dad.He taught you a lesson.
How is everything coming together? 
What did you want to happen exactly? 
That is sad
That makes me feel better
I bet that wasn't a great feeling.
I am assuming you did study hard for it right?
That sucks! Have you been able to contact the bus company yet and get it back?
Oh no! Would your phone cost a lot to replace?
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope it turns up.
Wow that was a long time ago_comma_ I am sure that you regret it now and have learned from your mistake.
That's good that your friend wasn't affected by your actions too badly. If you guys moved on from it then it was a great learning opportunity!
Its okay to stay at home
Tv can be fun though
Most kids are like that. I was definitely scared.
Most of us do that too. Kids over reacy to new environments
Don't be.I am sure you are ready.
We all are.
Awesome!  Where are you going!  I am jealous!
No I am really jealous!  I have wanted to go there for the longest time.  I am happy for you!
how thats cool.  
hard work must pay off if you are seeing results! congrats
That sucks to hear. I don't know too much about basketball_comma_ to be honest. Was it really a big deal?
I hear a lot of people say that_comma_ he must be real good. What team would you prefer to see him on?
So_comma_ you are not anymore?
Did you graduate?
Why does he do that
I guess thats a reason
That is extremely lucky.  It's nice to know there are still good people in the world.
Wow.  That sure saved you a lot of money on replacing a phone_comma_ too!
Oh no really_comma_ that really sucks to hear. Why were you not able to go?
It is sad that you can not go_comma_ but you are making a good sacrifice to make sure your family will be able to survive. Also you could use the alone time to do stuff you are not able to do with them around!
I am sorry_comma_ they are sweet animals
That is adorable
oh i hope she got better
well thats great news!
Why did she break up?
Did she give you a reason why she didn't love you anymore?
That's bad. I feel sorry for you 
Oh god. Thanks. I feel care for you. 
I felt the same way. 
Are they coming back soon?
That is never a good thing to do
You will get through it
Surely not_comma_ do you trust her. 
Then I wouldn't be worried_comma_ you can't live your life that way. If someone wants to cheat_comma_ they will find a way. 
Congratulations! It must've been a very happy day for you and your family.
I could imagine. I one day hope to experience that feeling.
Oh? How did you find him?
Oh he must be a good boy then or girl.
what happened to it?
that stinks
Why are you happy
That is nice to hear
I'm so sorry to hear that.
I lost my grandmother last year. It is a rough thing to go through.
I am very sorry to hear about your loss. take you were very close.
I am sure she is in a better place now.
That is great to hear!  Part of being successful is being confident_comma_ and you sure sound confident!
Try to be confident but not overly entitled.  There is a fine line between the two.  Congrats though if you get the job!
Wow that must have been a terrifying experience. Are you ok now?
That is good that you escaped your accident with a minor injury. Please take care of yourself in the future!
I am sure that will be fun
I bet you have a lot of good times
I could imagine! How do you lose your dog?
Oh_comma_ wow! Those dogs are smart! What did you change to make sure it doesn't happen again?
wow im sorry to hear that. you still stay in contact?
thats good
Wow what did they say about skipping it?
probably won't forgive him for a long time.
I bet that was stressful
I am sure they did not mind doing that
How'd he get out?
Oh man_comma_ I hope you weren't too hard on the kids.
wow thats awesome
sounds like you will be using that often
Yes_comma_ but I will be sad when it ends.
I can't wait to find out the end of the series.
Why?
I'm sorry to hear that.
That's sad_comma_ did you move away from your parents?
I'm sorry to hear that. That would be hard. 
Did he just come back to you?
That is pretty great! My dog takes forever at time because he's playing with the neighbors dogs.
oh no_comma_ did you ever get caught
did you learn your lesson?
I bet you were_comma_ poor pup
That is good to hear
Oh my gosh! Did you run and hide?
I don't live in an area that is known for tornadoes but they still scare me. I'm glad you're ok!
Oh gosh I hope so too!
I guess you got to just wait and see.
wow thats cool!
i bet that night was fun!
Did it get resolved
Well that sucks_comma_ sorry
Well you should always think that. It's not hard once you get into the groove of it.
Hopefully you do go to college. I had fun but was stressful.
I guess guys tend to do that
Forward isnt always good
How old were you? That can be dangerous_comma_ you hear stories of people falling in all the time.
I'd be scared too!
I am sorry to hear that.  Have you tried looking for him.
What kind of dog do you have?
what position did you play
wow thats awesome
because of my illness i got some frustration too
family is much needed thing during these time. take care of your health
Wow_comma_ I sure beat he beat your butt_comma_ I bet you thought you had it in the bag_comma_ rigtht?
Hahaha that just goes to show ya_comma_ age is just a umber!'
For sure. Trust is a key driver in having a good relationship with anyone. If you can't trust people then you will feel like you are alone a lot.
I agree with that. You should be able to trust people until they prove that they are untrustworthy. 
how often do you eat it?
oh wow
Oh no. What happened?
Dogs can be bad. Did he come home?
We've all been there. How did you do?
That was nice. That doesnt always happen.
Yeah that does make you feel good. But make sure it's a good charity.
I like those too especially when i don't want change anymore.
Well dang! Are you feeling alright?
I had an experience like that before - one that I never want to live again. How is the driver?
Oh goodness_comma_ I bet that made you jealous!
Wow! I'm glad it didn't escalate to that point!
I bet that tasted good
Oh well_comma_ at least it was something
It was a huge achievement when I graduated too. Did you get good grades?
Nice. Did you go onto to university?
what do you think happened to it?
that stinks
Well that sounds really sad. How long was he missing for?
Did you ever find him?
Oh man! I hate big storms too. Was it as bad as a hurricane?
Well that's good. Did you lose any shingles from your roof?
did you say something?
wow thats cool
That's an awesome experience. How was the wedding?
Did they have an awesome catering service? I am looking one for my wedding that is coming up
How do you like it so far
I am sure you will
Yes. And in the closet too
MY cousins used to play scary tricks on me. I hated that.
That's awesome! Were you invited to the wedding?
Do you know your co-worker very well? What do you think you'll get them for a gift?
How far away does she live?
Wow that is pretty cool of her to do.
I bet you were proud
That is great to hear
why dont you tell them to stop?
yea i coud understand that
That is great news!  Was he lost?
That has definitely got to be a relief that he is back!  That is the best case scenario.  Hopefully_comma_ he never gets away again.  Make sure to check your fence!
oh wow. did you clean it up
wow that stinks
What happened to him? Did he run away?
Oh wow. Did you put posters up all over the neighborhood to find him?
oh wow congrats
i wish i could go back to get another degree. thats great that you were able to do that
Thank god! Was your dog missing?
haha dogs always want to go out and play.
Oh no. What happened?
Hopefully_comma_ another position opens up! I'm so sorry to hear that.
That sounds so gross! Did you try any yourself?
Likewise! I even too terrified to try sushi. It just looks so slimy.
Wow_comma_ that is very annoying. What will you do clean the carpet?
That is good idea.
Summer was so much fun! What did you usually do with your cousins?
I used to be an outdoorsy person myself. Did you guys ever go to the pool?
I'm so sorry! Have you complained at all?
That's unfortunate. I hope that something changes soon. It is detrimental to your health!
haha so what are they like now?
I hope you taught them that it doesn't!
I'll be your friend
I used to have a had time making friends when I was younger. 
Thats great! How old are you.
You're never too old to have fun! Don't ever think that. Always stay a kid at heart
Awwwww that's so sad to here. Where did you rescue her from?
I would have done the same thing! Who does that guy think he is? I would've tried kicking him back.
Oh that's really bad!
That is just sad. People in education dying really sucks.
That's cool. What did you guys all do?
I bed it was exciting just because of the idea of getting caught!
Oh wow! Wasn't expecting that. But kissing your girlfriend is hardly something to be shamed of.
Maybe someone is playing a trick on you
Set a trap. Or maybe just a camera
How's it going with that?
hahaha I've been that way too.
Oh no! I'm so sorry!
No but I've had my hours so reduced that it wasn't working going to work due to everything going to union dues and transportation.
Oh_comma_ that's never any good. Did the group see you do anything embarrassing?
Well_comma_ that does sure sound like a show. I bet they shared a bunch of laughs over those wretched and foul farts.
hm never tried baked salad. How'd it go_comma_ Ramsey?
Well_comma_ you get experience points on that. Hopefully_comma_ the next dish is better.
It's been raining hard here in Virginia too. Did you get whisked away in a flash flood?
Some days trapped inside the house aren't always bad. At least you don't have to think too hard on what to do.
That is good! What work do you do there?
Must find some cool things while doing it.
That's horrible. Did they divorce?
Of course! betrayal is horrifying to go through. I hope he became a better man for it?
That's so sweet.
Was it for your birthday?
I hope I work with nice people like that one day.
There is so much different kinds it can be daunting sometimes on where to find the good stuff.
Oh wow. I would suggest using Spotify and then make a radio playlist on your favorites artists. That is how I find newer but similar music.
Sometimes it takes a while to really hone into your preferences. 
A+ for creativity.
Never ventured_comma_ nothing gained and all.
Seems like things turned out for the better. What is she going to do with the winnings?
Sounds like the responsible thing to do. Hopefully she gets a new one soon and her luck continues.
How exciting! Where is your friend originally from?
So awesome! Has she ever been to America before?
That is good stuff.  I bet that made you feel good!
You are so much fun!  Jogging gives off a pretty good feeling too!
I hate that too! Do you make him clean it up?
That's a tough situation to be in. I would just take all his belongings to the dump and be done with it. Maybe he can stay there too.
Yea_comma_ you can do whatever you want.
That's for sure. How long have you had your independence?
Really? Why?
I don't like vacations that make you feel like you are still at home. Where do you live?
Awwwww_comma_ poor little doggie. Did you end up helping the poor thing?
That's good! Small dogs like that make excellent companions. Do you plan on keeping him?
Wow_comma_ that's interesting. What do you do with it?
Oh no- Well I am the opposite. I rescue bambi and small critters :)
That's too bad to hear. What's wrong with her?
That's incredibly awful. At least the surgery fixed the injury (I assume). Did the doctors say when she is going to wake up?
Think I've done that_comma_ too. No regrets_comma_ my friend.
They are tasty sins.
are they being loud and annoying like usual?
Ugh_comma_ well good think mine are still at summer camp.
What's game club
Sounds like a fun club though. My school didn't have anything like that.
Well congratulations! What will you be doing at your new billet?
You managed to get a promotion_comma_ so you're obviously talented. I'm sure you will do just fine and earn many more promotions.
Oh no_comma_ how dare he! Doesn't he know that is forbidden
That's so sad :( Maybe he should buy you a substitute
that was nice of you
it could have been sentimental. like a gift from someone special
Wow. How'd that go?
That must've been embarassing. Happens to us all.
Me too! I helped a guy with his immigration case and saved him from being deported. He ended up becoming a pastor.
He deserved it. He was fighting for his life.
That's too bad. What seems to be wrong with him?
Doesn't sound good at all. Has anyone taken him to get it checked out?
Big Mac's are heaven in your mouth.
I mean you can still go back for more after this. Don't give up_comma_ bro.
I stayed at home - I hate trying to fight over that 50% off pack of pencils at Staples. What did you do?
Sounds like a swell purchase. Have you taught Big Brother Alexa to say any mischievous phrases?
I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ what led you to this?
Yea_comma_ you need to stay away from those_comma_ especially if you don't know who they are_comma_ your email should be able to block stuff like that_comma_ look in the settings.
Why is that?
Oh wow_comma_ you must have a lot of responsibility there!
That sounds fun! You must be really happy about it. 
Awww... how long have you had him?
Why didnt it work out?
Oh well that's good.
Are you attending post secondary?
That's awesome! What are you and your kids taking?
Thats cool! What band is it?
Fantastic! That would be so fun!
That sounds great. Was it a promotion or maybe a raise?
Oh I see. Well thats all very exciting. If you keep working at it Im sure you will continue to be successful. It will pay off.
O no! That's a terrible thing to have happen or see.
Was the person ok?
Oh! What is it for? Just remember to think of all your good qualities and the interviewers :)
Cool! What industry is it in? I hope you get the job!
What city are in right now?
Oh well_comma_ be carreful.Make sure nobody is following you.
Oh wow. Well are you going to use it? Why are you ashamed?
Why did you buy it then?
Wow that's awesome. Congratulations
Did you like the food?
Can you explain more?
Donate is good thing to do. Great
That is so disgusting!
I probably would have done the same thing.
I am a teacher so I understand.  You must be working well with him!  Do teachers know what accommodations to make or how to differentiate for him to be successful in the classroom?
The amount of pride he will have in himself with speak volumes.  Let his new teachers know what works for him.  You are his best advocate!
That is awesome! What do you go to school for?
Well if you are doing so well_comma_ I wouldn't quit! Good luck!
How sweet. How is it now?
It great that he has a good home then.
He must love his grandkids.
Ah well_comma_ he raised your and your brother so he knows what hes doing.
Don't feel bad_comma_ many people are experiencing the same feelings.  Try to focus on meeting new and interesting people!
Have you tried online dating?  Many of my friends have experienced success with apps like eharmony!
That's not fair. Why didn;t they split it up with more people.
That's terrible. Maybe you can get a promotion if you get it all done.
That sounds pretty admirable. What kind of animal? Dog?
Yeah_comma_ I'm afraid to get a cat because you never know what kind of personality you'll get with them
Thats very admirable.
Enabling is pretty bad. People don't learn if someone is always saving them from every thing.
I'm about to watch it! Please don't spoil it. I'm excited for it_comma_ even though I've only seen a couple of TV shows and movies based off of his books_comma_ and only read a couple of the actual books
Yeah_comma_ I like a lot of the actors they've got for that show_comma_ so I'm really looking forward to it. Might save it to binge it though
Did you ever come clean?
That's good. I always like about not understanfing football when I meet a guy. It makes them feel good lol
I am so sorry.  Our pets are not just pets... they are part of our family.  Go through the grieving process_comma_ even if it takes time.  You deserve that.
That is difficult.  My son didn't experience until age 10.
Are you deep in debt with medical expenses?
Have you considered talking to a debt counselor?
Law school Wow
I hope you do well
That sounds like a sticky_comma_ stinky mess.
What did you do?
I completely understand.  I will be starting law school myself very soon. 
What year of college are you in?
Sorry to hear that. I'm in the same boat. At least I have two dogs with me. Do you have any friends around
Yeah_comma_ they can be. Except these guys get really rowdy when there's a thunderstorm (like there will be tonight_comma_ sadly...). What about yours?
Some dogs can be very intimidating. I can understand that. Did something bad happen?
That can be traumatizing to a young person. I hope you can one day overcome your fear. Most dogs are very friendly.
That isn't nice.
That isn't nice.
That's rough. I've been around my siblings kids long enough to know how rough they can be_comma_ even though I don't have my own. How old are they_comma_ if you don't mind me asking?
Dang.. I love Dr. Pepper too. They can be selfish sometimes_comma_ but we just have to remember that they have developed the parts of their brain to make them care about more than just themselves.
That's awesome. Long distance can be tough.
Wow. I could never do that. I dont think I could.
Dang_comma_ that's quite an achievement. Everyone loves a good redemption story. How did you cope with it?
That's crazy! You deserve just as much props as he does! I'm glad you guys stuck it through. That's incredibly rare.
That is horrible. I would hate to have to deal with that when it's not my fault.
Yeah_comma_ they do have those sticky traps that you can put out to catch them once they spray really good. We dealt with roaches before_comma_ but got rid of them.
When did this happen?
You should buy some spray.
Falcons fan_comma_ huh? That's cool. I like the Green Bay Packers. You guys knocked us out of the playoffs a couple years ago because of our bad defense :(
Are you serious? I bet that was fun_comma_ to see you guys get to the Super Bowl on that. Memorable night.
That was smart.
I hope you didn't pay full price.
Why would you think that?
Try hard not too. That's the best you can do
It really makes a parent feel bad when that happens. I live with what my neighbor calls mom guilt.
very difficult. If you hadn't eaten it the child most likely wouldn't have wanted it.
You can still exercise now.
You should do it_comma_ even 15 minutes.
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think you struggle to communicate with people?
Shy? Yeah_comma_ I get that. I was too_comma_ until I started getting out more. The ability to socialize is a muscle you have to work at.
It is stressful situation. I hope your brother find time to help you.
Sorry to hear that
that's crazy. Snakes are one of my worst fears. Was it poisonous_comma_ do you know?
Hah. I would have to. I would have booked it the second I saw it. People could prank me easily with fake snakes if they wanted to.
Wow_comma_ you are? How did you find out?
What do you do_comma_ if you don't mind me asking?
Thats really awesome that they are still so much in love.  do you have a significant other?
Awesome! my wife and I got married 2 years ago_comma_ I hope we make it 30 years like your parents!
That's so awesome! So many times they don't come back. 
Fantastic! What kind of dog is he?
I'm glad to hear. What kind of surgery?
I'm happy she is doing well and making changes!
I hear you. I've had to change the diapers of my nieces and nephews for the past 15 years_comma_ as they've come and gone.
I've never potty trained them. At what age does that normally happen? 3?
I hate that. Flies and gnats are so annoying
Lol. It does seem like that sometimes. They can sit on the blinds for forever and move at the last second when you swing the swatter. Like Seal Team Six flies or something.
I am glad your ok.
I was in a car wreck once.
Are you a big football fan?
Do you paint your face and buy everything from your favorite team?
How exciting!  When is the wedding?
Wow that's right around the corner!  New Orleans is the PERFECT place for a celebration_comma_ too!
I haven't won on a ticket in a long time_comma_ but I once one $300!! Spend it on anything fun?
Hey that's still fun! I spent mine on paying off a credit card in part_comma_ which is boring but lead to more money in the long run.
Why did you lie?
How long will you go for?
Whoaa.... You probably had to throw that away immediately_comma_ huh? Don't worry_comma_ my sister-in-law forgot to put eggs in a cake one time and it came out like a brick.
Well_comma_ you live and you learn. At least you can bake_comma_ or try to. I don't hardly cook at all_comma_ besides simple things!
Whoa! That's incredible. What caused the change_comma_ finally?
I've heard about people doing that... Man_comma_ it's incredible how much your diet can affect you. I'm really happy for you guys.
It is wonderful to have a good parent.  They really do shape their children for better or worse.  I'm so glad you have a great mother!
I know exactly how you feel.  I have great parents as well and it makes me want to be the same kind of parent for my kids!
That's odd... Usually buses are always on time. Maybe the weather had something to do with it. I'm sorry to hear that happened to you. All dried off now?
Glad to hear it. Hopefully you didn't have any electronics with you... That would be my worst nightmare!
Big dinners are always a great way to tie everything up at the end of the day. Was it a pretty long day for you?
Haha I bet! Always great to have everyone together_comma_ though_comma_ really gets your mind off all the stresses of daily life.
I'm sorry. Are you sure you did that bad?
They'll be other interviews.
What shows are you thinking of specifically?
I didn't realize it was ending? You must be disappointed.
Oh wow_comma_ I hope you are fine!
Yikes. If I was you_comma_ I would get my own gun! Better to have it and not need it_comma_ then have not have it then need it!
payday is the best day! What are you doing to do?
OH wow! I feel you there and it's totally worth it! If you have to sit- get a donut pillow to not sit on your tailbone.
Oh that's horrible. Who's Brian Lawyer?
I've never heard of him_comma_ but that sucks. How'd he die?
Oh wow that's horrible.
What is the name of it?
I hear that stuff is bad for you.
Ohh no_comma_ were you pulled over wrongly?
How fast did they say you were going?
Thats great news.
That is great news.
Did you really steal it or was it more like borrowing without asking first?
Hmmmm. with no job and no way to pay it back I sure hope he can be understanding.
What show was it?
Oh. I've never seen that show. I know it has die hard fans though.
That's a tough one. Do you eat out a lot? That's usually the culprit. I had to learn how to cook for myself so I could afford to live.
Oh man_comma_ that's doubly terrible! Yeah_comma_ if you can_comma_ you should try to make a budget and get better at cooking for yourself. Huge money saver_comma_ but I'm sure you already knew that. I hope it works for you_comma_ though.
Those jobs are hard. You can always try it and see if you like it. I recommend a temp agency they often have nice desk jobs. Some even offer work from home jobs.
MOst work requires multi tasking. Yes that is true. You sound like you already have a good head on your shoulders.
that's terrible. Was it an expensive one?
No kidding... Who goes out of their way to get a lawnmower? Like... Why risk getting arrested and going to jail for a lawnmower... Oh well... Humanity. Sorry to hear that happened to you.
I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ I hope he is in a better place now! How old was he?
Oh wow_comma_ I can't imagine losing my dad at 67. I hope you make it through these hard times_comma_ stay strong!
Right on! That's cool to hear. Everyone likes to rag on older people driving. Glad to hear she's the exception. What kind of car does she drive?
Haha... That sounds awesome. Wish I could carpool with her. I hate driving_comma_ but it sounds like she loves it.
I have a friend who plans ahead like that.  I'm a last minute gal.  I think you will be less stressed by planning ahead.
Not to mention enjoy the actual party_comma_ too!  Are you celebrating anything in particular?
Oh my god_comma_ I would have been so embarrassed! How'd you react?
So you left work at lunch time? Did you come back or were you too ashamed?
Yeah_comma_ I mean things happen. Better to put it in the back of your head and keep trucking along.
Dang_comma_ a whole two weeks? Going anywhere_comma_ or just hanging out and really enjoying yourself at home?
That's a good way to do it. especially because it's easy to get those post-vacation blues. That's actually really smart
Good to hear you're confident! I'm sure you'll do well if you've been studying.
You don't have to tell me_comma_ I know you'll ace it! You sound well prepared.
Yeah_comma_ everyone speeds. Terrible to get caught. Hopefully you weren't speeding in a neighborhood_comma_ were you?
Yeah_comma_ I know. Adrenaline gets to you. You're human. At least you were doing it in a sort of safe way_comma_ it sounds like. Some cops are just out to get you.
Don't go check it out. That never turns out well in horror movies. Bring a gun then or another person.
I would do that! Or call a friend over- Get a weapon too.
Yikes... sounds like they need to hire better people. Hopefully the noise isn't too loud in the morning
Man.. Good luck with that. Sounds like it will be hard to fight them. But I hope it works out for you.
That is lucky!
I'm happy you got to avoid that!
Seriously? How? What was the mistake? Did you talk to him about it_comma_ or your boss?
That's sneaky... and hard to explain. I'm sorry you have to deal with that hard situation. What do you think you'll do about it?
Wap you must be disgusted with the farting. were you mad? or are you used to this kind of situations?
Yes i do have 2 siblings_comma_ older brother and younger sister_comma_ but we dont fart in front of eachother_comma_ i love them!
Sounds like the good old days seemed more relaxing and care free.
Oh man! I grew up on that cartoon too!
Yeah... that's a tough one. I've pirated stuff before. Kind of how it goes as a poor college student. Maybe when you get older you can pay for things appropriately.
Hahaha... Good point. I understand. Some things are just more important_comma_ fair point. My fault on assuming your age.
That's awesome_comma_ the exact opposite is true for me. My little brother is just about to start his first year of college next month!
Yes_comma_ I hope so. Well_comma_ I hope your brother can put his degree to good use and make some moolah!
Who knows.. I've dealt with slow internet all my life. Wish I could finally get a decent ISP.
Not really_comma_ especially since they vary sometimes by region. We should just move to Europe_comma_ I hear they have great internet there because they actually view it as important.
I am so sorry to hear that. I assume lots of folks close to you have entered eternity lately?
sadly we all know that everyone and everything is going to die_comma_ but that is why we need to really live while we are able. Don't retreat. Embrace everyone who is close to you.
Thats so scary_comma_ do you believe in ghosts?
Hope it's a friendly one at least.
Haha.  Makes it hard to take care of business_comma_ and you'd think she'd get the hint from the locked door!  I would have sat longer "just because."
Maybe her first class seat should be on the royal porcelain seat!
You should put yourself out there and meet some new people.  Just start exploring the city and you are bound to meet others!
It is.  It isn't healthy to be by yourself for too long.  Humans are social creatures!
Wow_comma_ no parent should ever abuse their children like that. Did you or anyone do anything?
Yea I totally understand where you're coming from. Hopefully someone nearby was able to call CPS or law enforcement.
Lol_comma_ what a bummer. What happened?
Well there you go_comma_ at least you a got a positive out of a negative situation haha!
Where did this happen?
Oh wow_comma_ yeah that sounds gross! I agree with the wasted food too. There are starving people all around the world!
Oh no_comma_ why were they closed?
Im sorry_comma_ I know how much that stinks_comma_ like when you really really want Chickfila and its Sunday...
Why would you always get fake checks? That would drive me crazy.
Well that was a surprise I bet.
O really? Any specific reason for this fear?
Flying scares a lot of people but it's safer then driving over all.
I have to say that is a true blessing. I have a wonderful mother myself. Why do you say she is a good mom?
She sounds like a wonderful person.
Oh really_comma_ congrats! yes when your kids acomplish something it is very happy for us parents!
Thats so cool_comma_ do you have any othe children or just one? when you have more they are very competitive
He couldve killed you!
I really hate bad drivers. 
I know that can be hard.  How long has it been since you've been out with someone?
Yeah_comma_ alot of times you just have to be reminded why you broke up.  I know there is someone out there for you_comma_ just stay positive and they will come your way!
That must of been no fun.
Hopefully she doesn't do it again.
I'm not too fond of them myself. Why don't you like them?
Yeah_comma_ especially fire ants. Those are nasty little buggers.
Sweet_comma_ was it a difficult test?
Yea_comma_ same_comma_ it's nice to be out of school. All that learning pays off though!
Yea that is the worst. I don't understand how it can comeout of here mouth
I hope you just walked away dude. Nothing good can come of that. I bet you were furious.
Well_comma_ that escalated quickly. I'm hoping this is not real?
:( That is messed up_comma_ did he/she show any warning signs before their passing? It's not your fault by the way.
Did you hurt your self?
That wasn't nice of them.
Sorry for the bad news.
I know she will make it.
Congratulations! What are you doing to prepare for it?
That sounds like a lot of fun. What kind of cake did you select?
It probably stank a lot too.
You probably should have moved with a shovel of something_comma_ instead of running over it
I am too! I am really not a fan on how he is handling relations with Russia. What makes him annoying to you?
I know right? Doesn't seem right. Especially with the whole Russian interference with the election.
Me too! These kids in this house are driving me crazy.  They need to get back on a schedule.
I think mine have two weeks left.
That must of been no fun.
Did you have a flashlight?
Oh no. Ive only been once but it was great. What happened?
That terrible. Were you able to get a refund?
How old is she?
Why not send her to summer camp?
What was it about?
What did you spend it on?
What movie was it?
I have never seen it.
That would be scary! Can you imagine what the dmv is like? 
That would be an amazing neighbor! I would be so worried!
That is great. Everyone should be loyal to their spouse.
Maybe you can renew your vows one day.
He must of been crazy.
Yes_comma_ id he do it for money?
Good luck with that. Do you found yourself confortable in your new job?
I understand
Holy moly_comma_ that must've been a very depressing sight. Did the police end up finding the culprit?
I do hope nothing of value was stolen. I would be frantic if someone stole my family heirlooms.
The visit would be the best gift ever and the paint job a huge bonus.
How far did they have to travel?
What job are you going to get?
What did you use to do for work?
I think he annoys most people.
His tweets are rude and ill informed and he never apologizes for anything.
I bet you were starving! Did they say why they were so late? 
Did you get it free? I would be so annoyed!
Aw man_comma_ I've been there before. Has anyone tried using it?
That really sucks. Fortunate to hear that no one misused it though. They are typically pretty fast at sending you a new one.
Wow_comma_ that sounds unique. What exactly do you sell?
Oh! Well duh_comma_ silly me. I thought it was food or something. Do you sell other things too?
Did you call the police?
They will find who did it.
Is he unable to take care of himself now?
How caring of you.
That sucks_comma_ did you still have fun?
What did you bowl?
She annoys me as well! She seemed pretty fraudulent in the last election.
Yes_comma_ especially for all those emails they found on her private server. Despicable.
That is awesome! What subject was it in?
I sure hope that you did. Statistics is tough!
I hear that_comma_ my friend. It ain't exactly easy living with mine_comma_ but ya gotta do it for love.
It has to be enough - that's the whole reason why we seek out a soulmate. I do hope things get better.
I love card games also.
Yes I have won a few poker tournaments.
Oh man_comma_ why are you even still sending him money?
Ahhh_comma_ so you're upset at your past self? We all make mistakes_comma_ man_comma_ it's good. What we think is good for us sometimes turns out to not be_comma_ but hindsight is twenty twenty.
So much for them being up front for you. Man $300 for what thats a lot.
Yea construction zones are crazy_comma_ so often nooones there!
That would be exciting! What do you plan to do with your winnings? 
That could lead to a gambling problem! I always run away with my winnings.
Yes_comma_ I hate that so much. The sound of screeching and crushing metal is traumatizing.
Unfortunately_comma_ yes. I had to get a few staples in my head but my car was totaled...
Smart move - it's always a swell idea to get ahead of work so that we can do the things we want to do in life.
Yup_comma_ I used to procrastinate all the time_comma_ but I think I am getting better at doing things ahead of time. And it feels so much better to get trivial things out of the way.
Aw man_comma_ that has to be rough. Were you guys really close?
That's even more saddening. Did you get to say somewhat of a goodbye to him at their funeral?
Did you return the socks?
That is mean.
Me too but it is still one more month of heat coming but it also means September is on the way.
Why do you say that?
I don't like 100+ degree days myself!
I like driving closer to the ground.
I could sure but I will be starting over on payments_comma_ I might look into it.
At the time it was a change and I like the ride of it_comma_ but I did not realize I would miss the sedan as much as I did.
What do you have against the ole waterbug?
That is terrifying indeed! I hoped you swatted that beast with the biggest fly swatter available.
Congratulations. Are you excited?
You'll do fine. I look at new things as adventures. 
That would be depressing_comma_ did you plan it yourself or did someone plan it for you?
Maybe if you post to social media_comma_ a bunch of random strangers will show up.
Ouch_comma_ was it an unfair test or did he not study?
Yea_comma_ hope he can make it up the rest of the year.
Ewww_comma_ throw that away ASAP.
Throw it in your neighbor's trash can. I'm sure they would understand?
What a nice gesture! What did you get to eat after not eating for so long?
What kind of toppings did it have on it?
Oh no! What was it?
Yikes! I hope you didn't have any car damage.
I hate it when people laugh at me_comma_ it's so humiliating!
Oh god_comma_ that's the worst part. The shame afterwards....
Yea man_comma_ that's good karma!
Me too. Its always the worst when you are trying to get into the carpool line.
That's awesome. I hope ro retire one day.
What are you going to do now?
What diet do you want to do?
Make sure you drink water also.
I have never heard of an EDM_comma_ what is that?
Lol- sounds like fun! Nothing better than nice hippies!
What does a caregiver do?
Oh_comma_ I see. Your mom is an angel!
What happened to him?
So sorry to hear that.  I hope that the pain fades with time.
Oh what a disapointment_comma_ well you can keep saving_comma_ does it hurts too much?
Oh ok i get it_comma_ well you just will have to save longer_comma_ thanks God its painless!
I am sorry to hear that.
I hope you had fun with her.
Same_comma_ I need someone else to watch horror movies with me.
Hahaha_comma_ you are very adamant I see.
That is so sweet. I want a puppy. and a boyfriend.
Why did you break up?
oh I do too_comma_ they must have been having a bad day
yeah I guess so what did they do to you?
Oh lord_comma_ you might make me vomit right now!
You totally aren't sorry. You are being super gross! lol. TMI
That sucks. I've been nearly broke too several times but thank god for family_comma_ right?
What happened if you don't mind me asking?
They are really nice cars! Have you driven one?
They are nice looking cars and I have heard are great to off road in!
That's not cool. Did you put your name on it?
I'm so sorry that happened to you_comma_ better luck next time.
Oh no. Why do you think that happened? 
Maybe you should slow down and only drink a bit at a time. 
I feel you on that_comma_ man. I get nostalgic all the time. What do you miss the most?
Haha_comma_ yea_comma_ no one ever tells you how bad it really is. We get charged for every little thing.
When I was younger_comma_ but yes
Was she okay? Couldnt have been that bad
Woman lol
Yeah_comma_ I hate that. Sometimes people will leave their carts right in the middle_comma_ blocking everyone while they walk off grabbing what they need. So annoying.
I guess they have never heard of a personal bubble.
I am not someone who likes that but I
I'm sorry it submitted early. But I'd love to hear why it excites you?
true! Thank you- It is very real
Ouch_comma_ did it make you late to work?
That's great to know there are still good people in this world.
I bet! Could you see yourself walking around?
I bet that brought back a lot of memories! 
Why? Are you from New York?
Nice_comma_ do you play football too?
What kind of gamer?
I love video games. 
That was very mean of him.
Did you call the police?
That is great! Always nice to see a good dad for once
Can you give me an example?
What's the Braves?
Okay cool_comma_ I'm not that big into sports. 
They must of been so proud.
Who gave them to you?
Who got them for you?
Are you quitting your job?
That will be a nice change of pace! Do you have plans for retirement? 
I hate that too. Have you ever noticed that's what they do in movies?
I have seen them leave whole foods in movies. gross
I wish there would be_comma_ but I very much doubt that there will.
I do to_comma_ but there are so many unhappy people in the world and they seem to think they have to make everyone else around them unhappy.
Oh nice_comma_ I don't really watch football.
I haven't really watched it on TV but my family watches it sometimes.
Did you fix it?
How many hours did you put into it.
I sadly have no musical skill.  Do you think you will ever become a musician?
What part of being a musician appeals to you?
Life can be tough sometimes. It almost seems like you spend more time preparing for the unexpected than living life in the present. It's cruel sometimes
It's always good to have happiness even in times of worry and panic. So_comma_ I'm glad you still have some optimism!
Wow! Did you report him to the police?
Sounds like that person has boundary issues. My ex's brother did that bother and I quickly nipped that behavior in the bud. Good on you for stopping that. Is he in too drugs or something or just entitled?
Omg. I was devastated I grew up listening to him.
I loved his song Starfish & Coffee when I was little.
What can you win?
How much is a ticket?
It was really sad. He was a really good artist.
That would be awesome. I bet it was a really great concert.
Why did he not graduate?
Did he go to college?
Oh no_comma_ well I'm sure you'll do okay if you just prepare really thoroughly. 
I hope so too_comma_ good luck!
Thats a bummer. Maybe you can take it to a repair shop.
Im sure they can figure something out. They might be able to remove the harddrive to recover the photos.
Oh my god! Have you posted everywhere and checked shelters?
Oh no! Did she have a microchip?
That must be so frustrating.
Yes it is. I would be furious!
Im very sorry to hear that. hopefully it will get better with time.
Im sure she is in a better place. Looking down on you.
I hope you do well. What do you think?
Does the job come with more pay?
Good luck to you!
Do you ever try to call the police?
Well do you try to catch them lol? Thats insane We have a dog poop problem at my apartments
I would just throw the bottles back at them
Oh yes_comma_ I bet the bosses love them too right? That happens a lot. Very unfair
Oh geez- work on your side hustle and get out of there. I did a long time ago. Hate those jobs!
You are very lucky. I have 4 children and I have been lucky also to have healthy children.
I know what you mean. I am always so sad when I see all of these sick children on tv.
I would be so happy if they could find a cure for cancer.
Wow. Can she handle all of that?
Thats awesome. She will do great in college.
That sounds awesome!
I'm glad that worked out for you_comma_ it could have gone in a completely different way.
Yay you! I hope your next project turns out just as good.
Oh no that is so sad to hear! I have one dog and two cats_comma_ so I totally understand what you are going through...
Aww what a cute name. Hopefully you an your Mom made up_comma_ and maybe you got/can get another pet.
Oh no! I know it stinks but maybe one day you can forgive her- I hope...
Oh no_comma_ I hope it was for a good reason
Oh man! It's hard when those accidents happen.
That's great! I hope it goes well for you!
Good luck!
Dang_comma_ I would have been so upset too. 
It would have sucked more if it was raining. Hopefully you have some good vibes come your way.
I bet. You guys were together for so long. Is this for the best?
Well I am sorry to hear that. If you need anyone to talk to let me know.
was? that almost makes it sound like you didnt graduate or something went wrong_comma_ did you graduate?
Nope_comma_ unfortunately not_comma_ i was hoping to at one point but it never worked out. What did you study? 
medicine and/or nursing_comma_ initially also liked psychiatry but then realised that its history is full of abuse and horror_comma_ some of which still is ongoing so i didnt want to participate in that. What can one use a business management degree for? Do you literally become a manager in some business or how does that work?
Oh no_comma_ Im so sorry! They probably already filled the position and it didnt have to do with you personally!
Yeah! People tend to be lazy and not take down the posting once they have filled the position and the automated emails will send a canned response instead. 
Sorry to hear that. Did you have trouble getting the extra precautions?
Well_comma_ I hope everything turns out okay for you.
i have
Irma last year
How much was it?
Wow_comma_ that's a lot_comma_ what type of vehicle?
how many of them were tehre
What color were they ?
Well_comma_ transportation is very important.  take some old clothing and cut it up if you have to .
Tissue is so expensive_comma_ it's unbelievable
I do as well_comma_ how long does it take you to do it?
that makes sense_comma_ but I guess everyone needs food!
Yeah? Who were they playing against?
I think I remember watching it. How old were you then?
It's a boon for everyone. Great life period is childhood.
Yeah_comma_ whenever I miss my childhood I try to spend the time with the kids. So we can feel better.
I know_comma_ but now we have another kind of football season coming up soon
Me too_comma_ I am so excited_comma_ since the Eagles just won last year!
Why is that?
That happens sometimes. Maybe you should take a break
what kind of food do they serve?
I do too_comma_ TN_comma_ but I can't think of a soul food place here.
cookeville
Its summer vacation. I hope you got enough sleep or it might be a long day for you.
Oh ok I see. Im sure he will want a nap later. Hopefully that gives you time to recharge a little.
I'm sorry to hear that. I lost mine recently also.
That must be hard. 
I know what you mean. It's not safe to send your kids out now.
I have to take my kids to parks outside of our neighborhood.
I know that feeling_comma_ that is no fun_comma_ but at least they are learning!
That is good_comma_ that is a nice way to make a bit of extra money!
I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you spend a lot of time with her?
That's terrible.  I hope she's at least at peace now.
I never really got into pokemon.
I tried to do the mobile game but I didn't get it lol
Oh really? How much did you win?
Hey that is nothing to sneeze at_comma_ I would take that in a heartbeat
Really? Have you got a large family?
But you are all very close knit then?
That must be fun_comma_ it is so cute watching kids try to read books for some reason
Yeah_comma_ kids are just so adorable_comma_ watching them learn in front of your eyes is an awesome privelege 
That's awesome. What was your major.
You'll do great. Your parents must really b proud.
Oh no. That may ruin the walls.
Hopefully she learns her lesson. 
What is it called? I may tune in!
Oh_comma_ I have hulu_comma_ I need to look into that!
What is you job now?
Oh. Well keep looking. You will find something soon.
That is really scary. Hydroplaning is something you can really do nothing about
It happens really quickly. You forget everything then.
Oh_comma_ you're starting up again soon_comma_ too? Me too. I'm excited and a little bit unexcited. Will be good to have a schedule_comma_ but worried about being able to do school and earn money to pay rent. What are you majoring in?
Hey_comma_ that's pretty cool! I'm majoring in social work. Those both are close alternatives to social work that I gave some thought to. Sometimes I think I should have done criminology_comma_ but oh well. I hope you enjoy your semester.
have you grown out of it ?
well thats a good start
That is obnoxious_comma_ I would switch just to stick it to them
that is terrible_comma_ that is not a good way to keep people
Glad for you. I have broken up with mine after 3 years of being together
It was her who initiated the first move for us to split our ways. She said she was not feeling happy with me
I would be more than jealous_comma_ but maybe I am not super sane about that kind of thing
That is probably true_comma_ but the stories we hear do not help
I'm sorry to hear that. Did she pass away recently?
Yeah. It is difficult when you lose someone you're close to.
that is a perfect time to go_comma_ that is when I went as well
It sure did_comma_ it was the best vacation I have ever been on
Was he just playing tricks on you_comma_ to get you to laugh? Or was he being malicious about it? 
Yeah_comma_ sometimes dads forget how young kids are and just do what they think is funny. My dad wasn't the best either at understanding how fragile kids can be. But he was still a good da
That is scary_comma_ I was in that position before_comma_ I do not know why they make it so difficult
Still_comma_ school is about making mistakes and learning from them
Nothing wrong with that_comma_ it's the unknown that scares us all.
I'd try not to be too down on myself over it.
My daughters started back to school today.
It's good_comma_ but I'm a little nervous for them. I know they'll be fine.
i agree on all terms_comma_ without family we dont mean much in the world
of course
That is not cool_comma_ I would cancel immediately
Oh_comma_ yeah you should definitely cancel in that case
That's lucky!  Did he get hurt from his shoes breaking mid game?
Oh no!  I hope it didn't effect his team too much.
that is pretty normal_comma_ so do i
those days will not ever come again_comma_ we have to live with it
who are we talking about?
Oh_comma_ I am sorry to hear that!
Why is that?
That is no fun_comma_ leave the kids at home for stuff like that!
Yeah - is it a reboot of the old version from years ago?
Oh cool - I haven't played all of them_comma_ but did playthe first one.
I'm not familiar with that_comma_ tell me more.
That sounds like fun_comma_ which game platform?
That is awesome_comma_ I am very much the opposite_comma_ hat is a great skill!
Wow those are not easy to learn either_comma_ good job raising them!
oh_comma_ what happened?
oh that's bad. I feel sorry for you.
Small things like what?
Ah_comma_ well for some people_comma_ that is a very big thing!
that sure is a lot of savings
did you check ebay ? its cheaper tehre
How small is small?
That's not bad. I want a 75 inch but I'm settling at 55 for now lol
Why is that?
Oh_comma_ well i hope the tides turn for you soon!
when is the release date
just in time for the holidays_comma_ nintendo is smart
How did it go?
Congrats! I bet that feels great!
oh_comma_ tell him not to feel nervous. He worked very hard indeed.
Oh that's great! good for you him!
Oh no_comma_ what happened?
That's not good. Maybe they are trying to protect them better_comma_ but haven't figured out a good plan
Wow that is not cool_comma_ why not tell your parents?
Ah okay_comma_ well that makes a big difference
i am excited for you
will you be playing it a lot ?
that is great_comma_ that is a dream come true for a lot of people!
I understand that_comma_ it can leave a large void_comma_ my mom used to be like that too
It can be hard. I went through that myself.
We have to deal with it and try to move on. 
How good. I think you like it a lot
to me likewise I find it a super fun game
thats what the love and family bond i think
accepting .. but not in my case.. you are lucky i guess
Notified of what?
Ah_comma_ that makes sense
That's always a bad thing about having to work with others.  What kind of issues do they have?
The worst kind.  I bet they think they know what they need to do and get really annoyed when you try to help.
about what?
I am sorry? I do not understand
no iam here dude
yeah me tooo. then how was your day today?
Okay_comma_ I'm feeling nostalgic about my childhood.
it was a long time ago_comma_ but I still remember it well.
ok thank you bye
4
4
Friends help us in difficult times_comma_ thank God we have them
I hope you overcome that situation with the help of your friends
That really sucks... did you tell them how that made you feel? 
I would tell them.. and if it happens a 2nd time then they arent very good friends to have! :/
Oh wow! That's great. Did she say how it went?
Hired the same day though...she must have done really well_comma_ despite being nervous!
Sounds like hard work has been paying off for you.
That is always a good feeling. I love when I am on top of things.
That's awesome.
I bet that warmed your heart. My old friends won't even drive across the city for me. We always meet downtown.
I went through that for like 5 years.  Ended up finally going and they've made a lot of advances in comfort since I last went before that.
Yeah_comma_ you should definitely bite the bullet (metaphorically).  It'll only get worse from here if you don't do anything_comma_ and it probably won't be as bad as you worry.
Thats great! How many do you have?
Wonderful! What kind of instruments do they play?
Are you better now?
That's so nice to have someone to depend on.
That is so annoying. Do you check the bag before arriving home at least?
Its the worst. I would complain to management. You cant be the only one it happens to.
I hope so too! Waiting for the call back is so nerver wrecking.
Take your mind off of it and before you know it_comma_ you'll be filling out new hire paperwork!
The strength remains us the prayer_comma_ it helps us to get ahead
Well ... God is in the hands of your doctors
Are you going to go out alone or with the family? vacation?
Well_comma_ I hope you have a lot of fun in contact with nature
Oh my god. That is horrifying.
I rescue animals_comma_ it's best not to let cats wander outside. So many bad things could happen.
yes! That can happen around any bigger dog. We had a foster dog do it. It is horrible! So sorry for your loss. I have lost many this past year. Accidents happen. 
You are not! I let my cats outside but supervised. Yes it's hard if they love it. You can get a special cat fence :) 
I can understand that. Was there a reason one color was chosen for her and another for you?
Sounds like you wanted to be the same as your cousin and not set apart. It may seem trivial now_comma_ but I know it wasn't trivial to you at the time.
It must be hard being apart. Just know he will return a better person most likely.
He will need your support when he gets back. Just stay strong and know its for the best.
Wonderful! Congratulations! What are you going in too college for?
You sure can! Hard work is required to get something of value.
:( I am so sorry to hear that... how old was she? 
She lived a long life for a cat but its never long enough for us who they leave behind. I hope you feel better soon... 
It really is bad everywhere and the bullying policies don't help. 
Yes it is. It makes me want to homeschool.
Wow! had she ever won before?
Sometimes those things happen just when we need them. It would be nice if they happened for extra money too! lol
You definitely can! What are your plans?
That's true. I wish you the best of luck!
I congratulate you on your children .... That says a lot about you as a father o mother
We need good parents_comma_ that will make the world more human
Mistakes happen but it's good you are learning from it. We all make mistakes
Maybe it will be just what you need though. Time to really concentrate and learn and grow within yourself as an individual :) Maybe you will have a nice romance too
That is very kind of you. You should take it to the vet for a check up.
I takes a special kind of person to do what you are doing. Im sure that dog is already much happier in your care. 
Oh no... yikes have you told your friend yet? 
well thats good of you! too bad it happened :/ but glad shes not upset 
That's nice to hear! What's going on?
Wow. Those are 2 fantastic news!
Sounds like you have a wonderful family. Some people take it for granted.
I've had those experiences as well. My family is also very precious to me. 
The weirdest thing... it sucks when you dont know whats causing it. Has she been to an eye doctor or just a general dr? 
sounds like a good idea i hope her pain goes away asap! 
You can. It will take some persistence. How's it going so far?
Oh that's like the reverse pregnancy. When the husband gains the weight!
wow! that's so amazing. I bet you are so proud of him
I bet! What a bright young man you raised!
Oh no. Have you made plans on what you're going to do to take care of them?
It sounds like a tough situation. I feel for ya.
Does she live far away from you?
How often do you get to see her?
how interesting. What country she is at now?
I think England is a pretty safe country. That will be so much fun when you go there
Oh man. I am sorry. Your time will come. That is a very hard situation! One of those hard ones in life.
Maybe you should ask your boss? Maybe he is more charasmatic. That happens sometimes. I am sorry. I've been there!
That is so generous. Sounds like she has found her calling in life.
I hope she is getting the donations she needs to keep doing this.
Was he abusive?
That's too bad. Hopefully he gets better and wakes up now that she left.
That is despicable.  What did you do?
I agree with that.  That animal is probably very lucky because of you.
It has already taken its first steps towards independence_comma_ that is something big
is achieved at a steady pace ... it fills us with hope and happiness
Thats a bummer. What do you do there?
Oh nice! Good for you. Maybe go for a run?
Wow. What gripe does your aunt have with your mom?
Those kinds of people usually have the worse self-esteem. 
Woohoo! That is amazing. hope it came with some great benefits.
Hey sometimes thats even better. More financial stability is great.
Must have been really nostalgic. Did you think about going to play on that field again?
Childhood seems to be a great time for most_comma_ but then we wanted to grow up too fast.
I bet you feel great too.
That is awesome. Congrats!
I'm sorry to hear that.  Tooth pain is something awful to have to deal with.  
Going isn't fun_comma_ but unfortunately it's necessary some times. I hope you feel better soon.
you did the right thing... do you foster them or are they yours since kittens? 
really kind of you! 
What happened?
Oh my god. You shouldn't just get over it- it is not right. Betrayal is something no one should do to another.
Wow! It's always nice when life works out well_comma_ especially if the person deserves it.
That is hard! I am glad she sees her worth and is going to get more education.
That's some great police workforce your town has. (sarcasm)
Wow_comma_ What state is this in?
That is awesome!  What are you going to do?
That is very brave.  I a sure you will do great!
What does? Were you in a car ride with your aunt?
Oh you're an 80s kids_comma_ hu? What do you feel about the music nowadays?
Is it something that commits you a lot?
ahh ... then you have to support it
That really sucks
I always hate when work gets in the way of having friends. It's always one way or the other.  If it's not your schedule it's theirs
Cool. Did he thank the "little people"?
That's good. Sometimes bosses think they do it all by themselves.
That is great.  you must be so proud
That is really impressive considering summer is really tough to learn that!
Great_comma_ are you taking anyone with you?
That should be a very fun trip for you.
Oh god. How big was it?
Man_comma_ that's scary. Is it out now?
What?! You should ask them for a free upgrade_comma_ because that's not cool.
That's awful. Try asking for the manager next time. 
Getting away is definitely needed sometimes.
Are you vacationing somewhere nearby or somewhere else?
That is disappointing.  What kind of laptop is it?
I know how that is.  Good luck with your search!
I know. Sometimes it's hard to have some left over after bills. What are you saving for?
Yea_comma_ it is a lot of expenses people don't prepare for soemtimes.
Why did you leave?
It's rare to find a place where everyone gets along. I hope your new job is still nice?
Yea_comma_ but I try not to compare. It'll just make me feel bad. What about you?
Wow. How does one get a new car every month. Must be loaded.
That's great.  True freedom!
I will get there one day.
Is it a well paying one?
stabilize things first_comma_ then save regularly.
That's awesome. You must feel really relieved.
Do you tend to have a lot of work?
Woo hoo! Thats awesome. Losing weight can be so hard!
Thats the way to do it! keto has helped me a lot. Yes a lifestyle change versus a diet.
Wow_comma_ go mom! Is she always such a sweetheart?
I hope you guys let her know how appreciated she is!
Yikes! What did he do to deserve that kind of punishment?
Oh man! You're right for punishing him. Theft is very bad!
That's great!  I've been meaning to_comma_ but haven't had the time.
Have you lost any weight over ht epast month?
WOW! I just found one dog and I thought that is rough. Are you fostering them now?
Wonderful! Rescues will help you with contracts and getting them fixed if you need help. Fix those babies up :) Thanks for keeping them safe!
She sounds like a wonderful person. People who try to help defenseless animals are really special.
She sounds wonderful. I'd definitely want to be friends with someone like that.
That is hilarious! Was it embarrassing or funny at the time?
I can understand that
That's great. Sometimes co-workers can be hit or miss. When you get good ones_comma_ it's awesome.
Is that something your work arranges?
How old is he?
Have you tried rewarding him when he does?
It is great to have more time with the kids.
MY first work from home was stressful I had to send the kids to daycare. Not anymore!
Uhoh.  Was it work appropriate?
Oh no.  When will you have to talk to your boss?
Wow. I bet he is tired all the time. I drink coffee all day for energy
Yeah_comma_ it's very important to finish school so you don't have to work three jobs just to survive.
Oh no! That's so sad.
I don't think they know where they're going. Probably just trying to get home.
Oh I used to love babysitting... depending on the child haha. How do you feel about it?
I understand where you're coming from. I would probably feel the same way in your shoes.
Oh? What's your new gig?
That does sound pretty good. I mean_comma_ working from home is great_comma_ but doing it on your own time is way better.
Lol. That's funny. Better hope you dont end up on YouTube.
You will be the talk of the break room.
Being single isn't all that bad. Are you looking for someone?
Better to be single than be with weirdos.
How can you tell if a cactus is dead?
I've never seen that before
that's very kind. Many people wouldn't go out of their way to do that.
We need more people like you. The world would be a better place.
That sounds like a good lunch! I love Taco Bell
That is definitely good_comma_ I am not that fortunate! 
That's pretty nice of you. Has she had any interviews?
I know the feeling. It can be hard getting back out there.
Why? What do they do?
People can be so lazy and inconsiderate of others.
That will be sad. Are you going to get to go again before then?
Take lots of pictures_comma_ so you can remember it!
Must've been a really difficult exam. Will there be other exams to balance it out?
I guess the teacher wasn't going to listen to you? That sucks.
That sounds great! Any particular cuisine in mind?
Oh I love those. They always have great selections and the desserts aren't bad either.
I hope it goes well!
try to get some rest beforehand.
Woah_comma_ did she say she was coming back? She's awfully trusting.
Totally_comma_ and I bet most people would walk off with it. I have no faith in humanity.
Are you the parent or the teacher? I get nervous meeting anyone new
I felt like that when my kids were younger. Doesn't feel like that now they're teenagers. It'll be ok just act natural
That was nice. IDid they have to start it over?
Did she hurt herself?
That's great to hear. What's going on?
That sounds really great. Happy for ya.
Wow. That's a great accomplishment. I hope to buy a house soon.
I don't stretch myself too thin. I know I'm far from rich.
Oh no_comma_ that sucks. What happened at court?
Jesus. That's terrible. I hope you get a breather from that.
That was so nice of them to do such a thing.
I bet it is. When things like that happen it makes you really value where you work. Makes it enjoyable.
Do you guys not get together often anymore?
You all can still spend time together separately even if you can't all be together. Have to make it work.
That's great to hear! If you don't mind me asking_comma_ what happened?
Still_comma_ that's still great. You better knock on some wood though_comma_ just in case. Don't jinx it!
I know the feeling. At least you made it.
Three hours though. I don't think I would've made it.
Oh no. what happened?
If only people were more considerate of others. It's not just them in the world.
Are they grown up now? They grow up so fast.
hahaha I bet there are.
Cool. I've never been camping.
I would be afraid of animals and bugs I think.
That happens sometimes. Maybe next year.
I took my kids to the beach and now every time we leave the house they ask if that's where we are going. 
Well it's 9 hours away so we probably won't go until next year either lol
Did you get lucky and some kind person turn it in
That is horrible. Just think it could have been worse. You could have wrecked and totaled a car or a house burnt. Lots of things are worse.
Glad for you. A girl I know was walking to her house and a car hit her and killed her. So it's just money and can be replaced
Yes_comma_ we are here for just a short time
OMG. I would have been so scared.
Did it get away or bite you?
With what?
Well_comma_ you're popular then at least.
that actually makes sense to me.
Did you notice any funny glances from anyone?
Did you taste anything funny from the lipstick?
That sounds great! Did you just get out of a rough relationship?
Oh gosh_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that. Hang in there_comma_ there's a lot of great guys out there.
probably_comma_ time to get the traps and get rid of it.
going to have to do something...call somebody to help you.
huh?
That happens sometimes. Is it like that this time of year?
will it pick up soon?
Why have you been lazy?
What kind of work is it?
Oh nice! Are you taking any cool classes?
How exciting! The first day of school is always so fun. 
Hope they don't find out.  Were you just tired or something else?
Well_comma_ next time try telling her the truth_comma_ like _comma_ I am too tired right now_comma_ can we do it another day. and that way you won't feel bad.
I'm sure she would understand if she is a good friend.
I bet it will be a good dinner_comma_ since there is some guilt involved. lol
That's true. I'm glad I live in an apartment.
Lol. I think that's more hard work_comma_ but you'd only have to do it once lol
What's the model/make
Dang that is a pretty slick ride...how close are you to buying one
I really hate that!
Some people are so petty.
Does that still happen? I can relate...it was a relief to go on vacation and get away from them.
That's great. I went to Europe for a while and came back to the more of the same stomping around above my head. It was a dream to get away.
Wow. That's exciting!
Its not that bad. I'll get to Europe one day lol
I dread that it will go so quickly!
What do you do during the day?
What were you standing on? Just the ground?
Are those by Kanye West? Not hip with the lingo.
I have heard water is expensive in California. Well _comma_ they are worth it if you can jump straight up five or six feet.
I might be able to do that_comma_ not sure.
Oof that sucks. Sorry about that. I dont like cutting my grass so my front door is covered in pink papers from city citations. oof
Nothing like redneck engineering. Did you use Flex tape.
Oh darn I really like those infomercials_comma_ wanted to know how the stuff worked.
Actually it costs 15 dollars where I'm located.
you like it a lot_comma_ now what does it do?
of Mike Tyson
I hate when that happens_comma_ and they tell you to come early too.
Seems fair_comma_ they don't value your time it seems like.
It is always nice to be able to rely on friends when you need them most.
I hope the party turned out to be a great success because of his help.
How come?
Oh no_comma_ I couldn't imagine! I'm so sorry!
Yeah and how easy life was? i wish we could atleast have 1 day a year like that but to actually feel as free as them! 
Idk ourselves maybe? lol :D
Do you mind talking about it specifically?
haha well that's a pleasant surprise...what kind of car
That is such a beautiful memory to have. I love that we forever have moments like this... How cool Hong Kong! 
I do actually quite a few mainly old country songs like daddys hands is a big one super oldie! :) 
Do you have a past traumatic experience?
Sorry to hear that.  I'm positive you'll be smart about your lifestyle choices though
Some things like that you wont ever forget thats pretty rad 
you should do it again just for the heck of it 
Sometimes I feel the same as you ... but I get up and move on
That's right ... I wish I could do that ... disconnect
Did you stub your toe?
Oh no! That's even worse! Did you puke a little? I would've thrown up!
What did he say? 
Always good to trust your spouse_comma_ but I would be on the fence a bit and have my eye out too. 
That is pretty bad situation he is in. I feel little mad myself too.
Yeah i would say the same to him too man.
When did you start getting better
That's pretty cool
How old is he? I really hope its nothing serious :/ 
wow that really is TOO young! Lets hope its nothing serious. He will get thru it regardless. 
What is it?
I can tell! Are you doing anything special for it?
Are you going to be okay
I am glad you are okay
That doesn't seem fair_comma_ I  hope they changed their ways eventually.
That's unfortunate_comma_ I wonder if he's forgiven them?
thats so sweet i bet she is how old is she? 
omg i cant wait to see what that feels like as a parent congrats! 
Oh no_comma_ please tell me what's going on! Can I help?
That's the worst_comma_ I'm sure it was an annoyance!
Nice I can relate.  How old were you when you moved out
That's cool. I was 17 when I first moved out.  Now I'm 26_comma_ fully self-employed and hang out with whoever I want to.  But I had to have a lot of faith in myself
That is pretty great! I like it when you can wake up and not care about stuff.
That is pretty awesome! I wish i could do stuff like that.
Did he get it for you for a specific reason or just because?
That's so kind of him! What a dad!
I am sure you will love it
I am sure you will_comma_ good luck
Why do you feel bad about yourself?  I am sure whatever it is can't be that horrible.
Even if you feel you voted for the wrong person_comma_ you shouldn't worry.  You will be able to vote for a new person in a couple years!
Good luck! I have faith on you.
I am sure you are going to excell
I love that as well!  Nothing better than unexpected cash!  Has this happened to you recently?
Awesome!  Congrats to you on that unexpected windfall!
I think you should get out and explore.  I'm in a similar situation--moved to South Texas with zero connections/family to jumpstart my business...and I've met some pretty amazing people
You definitely will trust me
That happen to me frequently. Did your manager said anything because you are late?
It can be annoying
I am sorry to hear that.  How long has he been promising you the promotion?
I can imaging.  He sounds pretty spineless and shady.
Why did they do tha
I am sorry that happened to you
Family is very important.
The same for me_comma_ i try to keep them close.
Why do you think that?
What will be her major?
Do you? You should trust her_comma_ that's what marriage is about!
That's awful_comma_ I'm sorry.
I am really sorry.Do you have house insurance?
Do you have a place to stay for a while?
Yes...but in what context
Nice that's pretty smart...always go with your instincts
Yeah....But his daughter is doing pretty well at least almost ending up like him.
Well she is still pretty young and learning to handle animals probably be like her father sooner or later./
Well_comma_ that't not your fault at all. It's your scumbag significant other's fault. You shouldn't feel ashamed for the crummy thing he did - you did nothing wrong.
If he's not meeting your standard then it's time to find a new boyfriend - even if that's the hard thing to do. You shouldn't ever lower your standards.
Oh my gosh no_comma_ are you feeling okay?
Are you taking medicine for that? Do you have heartburn or do you feel gluttonous?
I would love that too
That wont be too hard
Sorry to hear that. Is he better now?
Did the doctors have found what was the issue with his heart?
That's pretty cool. What flavor do you think you are going to get?
Berry sounds like it would be very tasty.
Whoa_comma_ did anything bad happen? 
I'm glad nothing bad happen_comma_ snake venom can really mess you up...
How did you feel about that
I know the feeling.  Just broke up with my ex-gf 5 months ago.  But he/she is out there_comma_ chin up :)
Wow good luck_comma_ I'm a big fan of watching MMA myself.
Oh oops_comma_ my fault for assuming. Definitely an intense experience either way as you said.
Ugh_comma_ I did the same thing today! I'm going to have to start making fresh cups in the morning and afternoon.
Can't go wrong with a spittoon. And it makes a nice conversation piece when you have visitors over.
That's awesome! Was it your birthday?
Your friends care a lot of you and that's always a great feeling! I hope you had fun!
Oh no_comma_ are you okay
I hate being that drunk
Dang_comma_ that's kinda hurtful. Why did you miss the wedding?
I've had those days before. I would just take it as a lesson and try to control your drinking next time when important events are in the near future.
How did it go?
How long did it take to prepare for?
Aw_comma_ sorry about that! Did you have a pet you could take there with you?
Yeah_comma_ I have a dog and I take it to the park sometimes. It can help you feel less lonely for sure.
Dang_comma_ that's quite a large amount of money to lose. Hopefully it went to someone who needs it.
That would be nice. Maybe he'll go and buy some candy from the candy store.
I try not to have any friends.
I advice not to trust anyone ever. Stay to yourself and be sad my friend.
I do not want to be the first one.
Well that isn't really pleasant i bet.
Well hope you didn't have flashbacks of it too often.
Best of luck! Have you won in the past?
Wow you're pretty lucky...I can never win those things
Are you a mother? It could be a maternal thing/instinct.
Oh_comma_ well you could still have protective traits as a male. How old is your cousin?
That's nice of your dad - it's sometimes hard to get a car on your own. What kind of truck is it?
Nissan's are top of the line. I hope you get a lot of use out of it.
What is the trick
That is a good dog then
Aw_comma_ that sucks. Everyone gets old eventually_comma_ how old is she/he?
That's good to hear_comma_ I hope he feels and gets better
I think those people don't actually eat that much_comma_ it just seems like it though.
If he's taller/bigger than you it would make sense if he doesn't gain any weight
That seems like a lot of pizza rolls_comma_ how do you feel?
Hey_comma_ we all pig out at some point
That's too bad. It's nice to have friends to revel in our victories. Why don't you get yourself a beer and relax on the porch?
If you need someone to join in_comma_ just let me know!
I am sorry to hear that.  Any certain areas you think you could have done better on?
Don't be so hard on yourself.  Most people can't even spell physics.
Oh no what happened
I am sorry_comma_ I hope you find it
That's so sad to hear! How did she pass? If you don't mind me asking.
That's terrible_comma_ my friend. How are you holding up?
I love it when it rains.
Sunny days are very hot and i do not like that.
Nice_comma_ I usually forget a thing or two. Did you get everything you needed?
I assume you were very prepared!
What techniques have you learned so far though?
I think you will do pretty well then in a street fight.
Go on
That's pretty cool.  Grew up with the Gameboy Color and Gameboy Advance myself
Wow_comma_ that sucks. Did you try calling the grocery store?
Your neighbor is a good person. I would have...given it back to you haha.
I have a pesky_comma_ sneaky little dog like that too! Did you clean it up?
That's good. Was she guilty when she saw you cleaning it up?
That is disgusting_comma_ my dog does that too but in sneaky places. It's always a surprise lol
Yeah_comma_ our dogs need to be punished and maybe trained more.
Oh wow. Maybe they were busy doing other things? Did you find anyone else to play with?
Sometimes playing by ourselves is how we get better.
What kind of job
I am sorry that happened
Six Flags is such a fun park! Are you a fan of roller coasters?
They are! Cedar Point has some gnarly roller coasters too.
I love that too! Isn't it great!
What are you planning on doing with your vacation time?
What happened that day?
Did any of you get hurt?
Wow_comma_ that's unfortunate. People don't realize that can happen but it happened to my friend when we were little.
Sorry to hear that_comma_ recovering from any pet lose is hard.
Did you get attacked by a big dog when you were little?
Maybe it was because you saw your brother get attacked by one and you are scared it might happen to you.
Did you try to go to the grocery store to give it back?
I understand.
Sorry to hear that. How did she pass?
Man_comma_ very sorry to hear that. First your mom_comma_ now your aunt. Sounds like you have very unfortunate relatives.
I do love to read as well
That sounds so nice
Holy moly! Sounds like you are eating well tonight!
Well_comma_ I'm sure you can find a recipe online that uses spent lottery tickets.
Are you homeless?
Lol_comma_ I bet that a good looking sandwich then.
Oh_comma_ you will probably be just fine don't worry about it too much.
Dentist aren't people focused on trying to hurt you.
Ut oh.. What did you eat?
Don't worry... you only live once!
I hate driving_comma_ I avoid it as much as possible. 
Mine was from being in one and just being nervous about having to be in charge of things.
Thats good to hear. Why do you thank god for her?
Well thats nice. I thank god for my wife as well
Well there are always bigger fish in the sea trust me.
That is also very important to learn.
That sucks_comma_ do you feel better now?
Yeah_comma_ isolation can happen when you get super sad. At least you are feeling better now
That's always a positive in my book_comma_ what kind of food was it?  What were your reservations about the restaurant before going?
Is it in a bad part of town or is the building just bad luck or run down?
I am sorry_comma_ that sounds bad
Maybe it wont happen again
Oh my gosh!  That must have been so embarrassing!
Don't worry.  I'm sure you will never make that mistake again!
Aw_comma_ that sucks because money was the issue. Maybe she can take a bus or something?
Yay! I love happy endings
Oh how scary! What happened?
I am so sorry you had to see that. That is so bad. Did you have to call it in?
Ouch! that stinks man why she do it?
That is even worse_comma_ Like why would someone just do that when commited to someone.
Parties are some times very loud.
If my friends did that I would have a heart attack.
What movie are you referring too?
Oh! Well i haven't seen that yet. was the action at least somewhat decent?
Yeah I hate waiting for the results of a long term goal
Damn_comma_ you suck at soccer. Just kidding_comma_ good job!! lol
Oh no.. what happened?  Are you ok?
What did you lie to him about?
I am sorry_comma_ he will stop eventually
He will get better
Wow_comma_ why does he need to drink so much?
I'm sorry_comma_ I've dealt with something like that before and it can be very anger inducing.
Did you do anything wrong?
Oh.. thats horrible.  I am so sorry.
Myself as well_comma_ friends are what make life better.
Alone time is important but you will go crazy if you are always alone.
Was it a smartphone? Maybe you can track it ?
Aw_comma_ that sucks. Did you get a new phone?
He is a terrible person! Did he even know it was your cat? What took so long...
I hope you feel better
What kind of cars do you like the best?
Range Rovers are my favorite too. If you work hard you can get one!
When did she pass away?
Well have you been living a happy life? She would probably be happy about that.
I am sure she is happy too
It can be hard_comma_ but its possible
Do you have cameras?
I know right? It's even more worse when it's hot outside and it cooks to your car so it's harder to clean up
Have you seen any recently? It is really sad_comma_ what gets me the most is hearing about black bears being hit.
Poor thing_comma_ it's not fair! Drivers need to watch out!
Well hopefully the car didn't get damaged.
Well i would just be happy nothing too bad happened at least.
That's frightening. Was it dark outsside?
That's even worse. I hate being lost in general
Oh man that stinks. What did you do in response?
Did he ever apologize?
I've never had a party like that myself.
No one really likes me enough to do that for me.
What journey?  Do tell.
Oh Congratulations...  That is a huge accomplishment!
oof_comma_ that is a long healing process after the surgery.
That is tough i bet. I hope he heals well.
That's awesome! Did you guys do anything?
Nice! I hope you guys did a lot of catching up!
Wow! What a jerk for him to up and leave with no way to contact him. Was it a lot of money?
I'm so sorry_comma_ you should see if you can find him on social media!
Who was following you?!
What did he look like? I would call the cops if they are stalking you.
Oh man! Does it still work??
I would have sat there playing for hours.
Oh snap! dude get your camera you might have found nessy.
Probably could be a new species of gator.
I know how that goes.  It can be hard to stay on track at the end of the semester.
Congratulations!  Studying really pays off!
Jeeze_comma_ I thought that only happened to me. Doesn't it just suck? I don't blame you for not picking it up_comma_ I can imagine how gross it must've been
It's okay_comma_ most people would do that and not even care_comma_ so the fact that you even have the trashman in your mind shows that you're a good person.
Yeah_comma_ been there done that. You want to comfort them but you don't know what to do/say
I hope he feels better and you could be there for him too!
Oh poor lady. I know how it is though. Sometimes our initial reaction is to laugh even when not appropriate.
At least you recognize that it may not have been appropriate. 
I can imagine. Was she a hoarder of some type?
Did you see anything interesting?
Did you tip him well for doing such a good job?
It is not often that you get good service at a restaurant.
I enjoy doing that after a hard day at work as well.  I hope it relaxes you!
Now I am in the mood for Netflix!  Enjoy the new series now that you are relaxed!
Did you punch him in the nose?
This is why i got rid of all of my friends.
Ah - that's a big accomplishment!!!  Did you get her a great present?
HAHA!  That is the best tradition I've ever heard of!
Oh man_comma_ I know the nerves can be rough_comma_ but I'm sure you're excited as well. But yea_comma_ throwing yourself into a group of new people can be rough.
Oh wow. Well_comma_ I really hope you enjoy the new job! I have a feeling you'll do just fine.
Yes.. I have a test coming up and I should be studying right now!  LOL
They say some of the smartest people are procrastinators.
Did you find anything interesting inside any of the buildings?
Oh man_comma_ I would have freaked out! What did you do?
That is pretty great! what show is it?
Haven't heard of it but since your son's going to be on it i will watch it.
As someone who was once a 19 year old man_comma_ don't be too shocked.
Yikes he's one of the zombie drunks.   That's unfortunate.  Drinking might not be for him.
Most do. I know a guy that kind of gets blackout drunk like that.  His brother does too.  Now neither of them drink hard liquor (well they haven't for ages now)
That's really cool. I know how much my husbands pocket knives mean to him.
That's really interesting. I know my husband is bad about leaving his laying around and forgetting where they are. When he finds them again it is such a surprise.
What was it?
So everything is okay then? That's good news!
Oh no I'm so sorry to hear that. Are you thinking about getting another one?
Oh I understand. They say time heals all wounds_comma_ I hope it does in your case as well.
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. I have been to court before; it isn't as scary as it seems.
That won't happen. Even if it does_comma_ the judge may have a good laugh and cut you some slack.
I am guessing she is not with us anymore?
I know the feeling i had my grandmother gone for 5 years now still miss her.
Did he tell you the reason?
If you live under his roof then you should obey him.
I understand_comma_ I have trouble waking up early too.
Me too_comma_ I just have to set a bunch of alarms and try my best.
Were you worried it could be something very serious?
That's good to hear. I'm sure you feel very relieved now.
What was that?
A bunch of toys and stuff?
That is pretty good news! What kind of job is it for?
Everyone needs a IT guy though so probably.
I see people walk out of the bathroom all the time without washing their hands. So gross.
That is really disgusting. I don't think I would ever eat at his house. 
Yeah_comma_ no doubt!
I'm sure you aren't the worst in the class_comma_ don't say that!
There's always next time_comma_ you just need to study harder!
That is awful. I hope she has friends and family she can lean on during this tough time.
I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.  I feel so bad for her.
That's unlucky_comma_ did you ever exchange information?
Well I hope it all works out in the end somehow.
What kind of dog was the costume or did it look weird?
Well were they trying to sell something maybe?
That is so cool.  What kinda stuff does she juggle?
hahaha funny.
Oh_comma_ lord. Did the other person die?
Man_comma_ i would have left and walked out right away.
That has to make you feel so good deep inside.
Wow_comma_ that is thoughtful.  Thoughtfulness will help him go a long way in life.
Wow! How can someone do that to someone with someone so close?
That's such a shame. And shame on his brother_comma_ too!
What did you watch/?
So what was it?  You are making me scared.
Oh man that is pretty scary.
You should probably see a priest then.
I hate when that happens.  Makes you want to leave things for the mailman.
I hope they can take it back for you.
Are you baby crazy?  Let me guess.. 30-ish?
That sucks. Missed opportunity or biological problems?
Whatever it is_comma_ you seem excited. What is it?
Vacations are sooooo nice!!!  I hope you have an amazing one@!
That's really annoying for you but I hope everyone involved is okay.
I cannot stand people who do that! Don't they know they could be blocking someone from getting the medical attention they need?
Why are you there all alone?
I hope you aren't too lonely!
Oh no. Why did he steal?
Sometimes they have a reason_comma_ and it doesn't make him a bad person depending on the reason.
That was so nice of her. I'm sure that you really appreciated her for doing that.
Maybe you have a budding chef on your hands.
A bit of nostalgia_comma_ huh?  It is always wonderful to look back on old family memories.
The times we share with family should always be cherished.
Oh no_comma_ what happened if you don't mind me asking.
Oh man_comma_ that sucks. You can enjoy the day on your own! Forget them then.
Oh_comma_ I love surprises like that! How exciting!
I hope not either but it's sweet!
You must be thrilled. What did you have?
Is this your first?
Oh no_comma_ I know that must make you feel bad_comma_ but you can't always be there.
That's good. How many girls do you have?
That sucks.  Maybe they can wait just a bit longer for you?
We always need to make time for our families.  They are the most important thing in this world.
Wow. Must be a really good show. What's it about?
I love thrillers. I watched Killing Eve.
Are you working while you are at work?
Smart man smart man.
Oh no_comma_ what happened to cause the cheating?
Have you guys talked about it? Or is he still upset?
How many do you have? Are they excited?
What is making you so nervous?
had they been eating too many?
oh_comma_ that's a cute one.
What will you do if you can't be with your wife all the time?
Oh that makes a lot of sense now then.
Ohhh no!  There was no one there to offer you a towel?
Was it crowded?
How many kids would that be now?
hahaha I bet they do! 
Do you have another way of contacting them?
You must be worried sick. The roommates sound suspicious.
Wow! Thats amazing. What are you going to school for?
Oh that's great. Marketing is very lucrative!
I hope everything works out. That all sounds very promising!
Oh no_comma_ I wish people didn't have to go through the bad stuff. At least_comma_ they make you appreciate the good times more.
That must have been scary. 
When you hear thunder do you hide now?
Was it stressful? 
They school was locked up? I can't imagine. My first born is due in December and i'm all ready stressed about school. 
Wow_comma_ that sounds like where I went. Have you considered a charter school?
I would be scared. They are so impressionable at that age.
Please be prepared ahead of time. I know that situation can be scary so it's best to be ready.
Keep alert and be safe.
Oh wow! That is wonderful! I bet you were so grateful.
That was so nice. Maybe someday you will be able to pay it forward.
That's so awesome. Is she little or big?
But she needs you. It's similar to mine. My found my pit eating out of the dumpster. What did you name her?
That's sad I'm sure she will come around soon.
It is always such an exciting time for them. So many new things to discover.
If they get a really good teacher it can instill a love of learning that will stay with them.
It just started storming here. I hope we don't lose power.
I keep saying we will get some flashlights_comma_ the ones only phone are only good if the phone is charged.
Yes typically kids are nicer and more open. Adults have so many secrets and issues :)
I here you! But it's better to make a good friend then many that aren't that good. Maybe try church or meetups?
Oh no_comma_ how many pets do you have?
That's incredible. I love animals and those who help them!
Those butterflies are good for you. It will keep things interesting.
Don't be afraid to be yourself. She will love it if you do.
Oh no_comma_ the poor little thing. Your nieces must be devastated.
Oh no_comma_ that happened to my dogs. One died before the other_comma_ and the other was so depressed_comma_ she quickly followed.
Yikes that sounds like a pain. I would dump my trash in front of city hall.
Time to make your town facebook famous or something. Shame them into fixing things. 
I was robbed in Flint. I grew up just down the road from Fenton. You need to move. 
Wow_comma_ I wonder why he was being so generous
I hope not either!
Oh no. What did you use it on?
Oh I'm so sorry. Hopefully_comma_ you've learned and won't do it again_comma_ yea?
New hobby. Maybe surfing or hiking.
Your never to old. I thought my father to surf at 67 years old. Your die sitting in front of a puzzle. How about Yoga or painting class? 
Yoga is low impact. They have classes for all ages and levels. It will be a reason to get up and help you stay healthy longer.
That is so incredibly nice of them.  It is nice to have good neighbors...and good pears!
Wow_comma_ I wish I had neighbors like that.  I'm stuck going to the store and paying $2.99 a pound on them.  You're right_comma_ it is expensive.
That's great! I hope things continue to go well for ya.
ah always gotta prepare for those unexpected rainy days.
Were you able to reschedule with your friend?
Maybe you can make it up to them.
Oh no. Being home alone can be good though. Finally everything to yourself!
I feel ya. How long will they be gone for?
Oh_comma_ that is so tough. I am sorry. Are you all right?
That's where you really do have to make the decision for the animal_comma_ not us -- that doesn't make it easier when it happens. Do you have other pets?
Yes! Vacation. Where ya headed?
Oh you'll have lots of fun!
I'm sorry_comma_ that's life for most of us_comma_ though.
Maybe you'll hit the lottery one day!
That had to be disappointing. Will you be able to go at another time?
At least you have something to look forward to.
Oh no. How is your butt now?
hahaha I hope you recover soon.
90s were good time. What is your favorite memory?
Oh yea. No bills is definitely great. You can still do all those things y'know.
Aw! Well I hope you can help him?
Oh I bet! Are you just babysitting?
That's got to be a pretty good feeling_comma_ to see our kids succeed and hopefully do better than us. I'm happy for you! What does he research?
Parkinson's disease? That's pretty noble. Imagine if he were to be the one to help cause a breakthrough on curing it... How crazy would that be. Would add a nice legacy to your family.
Oh man_comma_ siblings are such hit or miss sometimes. Some get really good ones and some get_comma_ well_comma_ yours. Sorry to say.
Everyone has their faults I guess. I'm glad you don't focus on their faults.
Who is your favorite team?
Who is the quarterback now
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
Are there any social groups you can join to have some company?
Is he bad at his job or hitting on you?
Make him Facebook famous. The Viral terrible mail man. 
Send you self a empty package or something.
Wow. Raccoon digging through the trash_comma_ hu?
Are you usually afraid of raccoons or just surprised?
Was this an unplanned trip?
Well_comma_ I'm sorry that this was sprung upon you_comma_ but I hope you have a safe trip!
Wow. That's a pretty low thing to do.
Oh just a nail? You are a nice person.
Wow! What a champ for doing that. You guys owe him!
Get that man a wife!
You must be so relieved that its done. 
They are going to have so much fun with it.
That's a really adult move on her part.
She's showing she's responsible. I think she'll be just fine growing up.
I wish you the best of luck on your proposal and the possibility of it becoming a reality.
What kind of project may I ask?
I hope you did well and congratulations on Law School!
Law is a pretty tough career. You must've worked hard_comma_ and I'm sure that will pay off.
Sometimes it is very hard and the jealousy can come out. I hope you have a really strong relationship though.
I have seen many relationships be destroyed because of time and space. Good luck to you all.
That's so great to hear. Relationships can be hit or miss sometimes. Sounds like you got a good one.
Over 2 decades. That's a long time.
That sounds cool.  So you are fixing it yourself?
Best of luck with that.  Hopefully you will do fine and save a ton of cash.
Oh no_comma_ do you at least have food?
Ramen is delicious! I eat them even when I'm not worrying about money.
Whoa awesome! Really you've never been? Which one are you going too?
Whoa! Make sure to bring money for food or bring frozen drinks. And lots of sunscreen and comfy shoes!
I'm glad you can do what you're passionate about.  What kinds of animals do you rescue?
That sounds so fun.  I hope I can do that some day_comma_ too!
I can imagine. Take this time to do something for yourself.
There you go. Sounds like fun.
Caught by a train? Do you mean it was late?
hahah I was kind of concerned but didn't want to ask. Glad that is the case then.
What did he do?
How do you cheat a little. Either you cheat or you don't.
what show was it ?
i loved the ed gein documentary 
Oh no thats terrible.  Did you make it up to him?
That is thoughtful!
congratulations. You worked really hard and deserved that pass!
That's an amazing feat. Studying is kind of a chore for me.
Awww.. what kinda dog is it?
that is so cute.  I had one of those.
Oh_comma_ were you just tired that day?
lol it happens. Had a good night?
Congratulations on the kid
I am sure she will be fin
I get that so many people in the world are so much worse off then us. I think it's easy to forget that.
I wish I could be more like you. 
Oh no! I really hope it goes well for you! That must be so stressful!
I'm sorry. That is a really tough situation. I'll be thinking of you and hoping for the best.
I'm sure you'll be able to do yours soon.  And maybe you can get some good ideas from hers!
And when you do yours it will be that much newer than hers ;)
I bet you are very eager to find out_comma_ good luck!
Was the test hard?
Double check your list.  Camping is always wonderful but hard to come back for something you forgot.
Did you make a list?
Me either. I don't want too though_comma_lol. Are you scared?
Oh man. Well I used to cuddle a dog when I would get scared. Find a dog
Oh nice. What color is it?
Interesting to see how muave works. That's a shade of purple_comma_ isn't it?
Oh no. I hope they're okay. How long until your neighbor gets home?
I hope everything turns out okay.
Man_comma_ that's horrible luck. Did you forget to lock it_comma_ or did they just bust in?
Are you kidding me? The nerve of some people. How desperate do you have to be... Well_comma_ I hope you can at least replace the present so your son isn't too sad. And at least they didn't try to bust into your home and harm you.
That's pretty lucky_comma_ did you spend it?
Well if you do choose to spend it make sure you do it wisely!
Lol! The real question is...was the poop fresh or old? I hate that shit_comma_ no pun intended
Ewww_comma_ did you clean it off?
I wish I had a expedition
Why do you think that?
I agree with you there. Let's just finish this one.
I hope they do for you as well. Thank you!
That's funny. I'd tell them the tooth fairy stole it. 
You better come up with something.
Oh man! Will you need a new keyboard now?
Oh don't worry_comma_ accidents happen!
Yes!!! I hate the city and prefer the rural areas. Are you going to get farm animals?
I agree_comma_ I love farms because it feels so natural.
At this point all you can do is hope for the best. Hopefully if you worked hard it will turn out good.
Don't stress over it. You can't change anything at this point.
That's always rough_comma_ maybe she didn't hear you?
Well she was just rude then. Not your fault at all.
OMG that is wonderful!!!  I bet you are really proud!
You say that but it sure is nice!
Oh wow. Is it raining or something over there?
How long is the work gonna take? I hope you don't get any weird power outages.
That sucks. What did you order?
Yea_comma_ Mcdonald's can be so hit or miss sometimes.
Thats sucks
Well. Maybe youll get a promotion.
It would.
Nice! Where did you learn Thai?
That's impressive. I bet you are more than prepared for this trip then!
You're moving into the dorms soon_comma_ hu? Are you excited?
What's your major?
That is cool! Was it a gift for any certain occasion? 
I bet you were so happy! That's so awesome!
I am sure it will be worth it in the end
I bet he was proud too
Animal abuse disgusts me. I don't what would drive someone to do that...
If I had a chance to rescue an animal_comma_ I would totally do it. 
Did you get sunscreen and a waterproof belly bag and a hat?
Oh no! Yes it's the number one thing to not forget. I hope you all have fun!
Wow_comma_ how exciting. I bet it looks like a fat little old man.
I would hit it out of spit now
Must have thought you wanted some of his sweet unemployment check
That's what I'm talking about! That sounds so nice. I'm a little jealous. Sounds like you deserve it_comma_ though.
That's always nice to hear. Better that then hearing someone else getting the spotlight and recognition just because they're in a higher position. I hope that keeps happening for you.
He sounds so computer-savy.  How will you repay him?
Dinner might be a welcomed surprise.
Me too!! I love summer weather and vibes so much
I know_comma_ the free time is the best. You can do whatever you want_comma_ whenever!
OH no. Shame of you!
Just don't do again and I'll keep your secret.
What happened?
Nice! What is his major?
I am sure you will get it
I do believe you
Whoa whoa whoa_comma_ that still happens in this day and age? How did they even get away with that?
Well_comma_ good. I hope they got a lot of negative press. That stuff shouldn't fly these days. 
That is way too much money to blow for sure
I feel bad for the parents then
That is horrible! Were their any cameras?
Oh man. That's too bad. Still not fair.
Sounds like so much fun.  What did you see?
It must have been really scary movie then.  Try leaving the tv on to help.
That sad. I hope she is okay.
It will be fine. Make sure you spend time with her and let her know that it will be okay. It can be helpful/
That sounds delicious! What type of pizza did you order?
Lol! Maybe the rat is the chef? The restaurant's secret is a rat in the hat!
Aww_comma_ that's sad. Do you have a bad relationship or not have one?
That can get really lonely but it's good to find yourself so you are really ready when the right one comes along.
I feel you_comma_ my brother is my roommate and my friend too :)
That sucks_comma_ why did she move out?
I know exactly what you mean. I've been single 2 years now.
I think I'm a little rusty in that department myself.
Why aren't you looking forward to it?
That's unfortunate. A week is a long time.
That sounds like a lot of fun! I mean I haven't even really gone anywhere higher than Olive Garden myself_comma_ so I'm jealous. Did you go with anyone special?
That's really sweet! I bet that was a nice scene. Was it a special occasion_comma_ or did you guys just want to enjoy yourselves just for the heck of it
Thant sucks. I always use turbo tax. 
Maybethey will let you do a payment plan?
Well I bet you'll do better next time. I hate paying extra for anything.
Oh wow! That's awesome! What will you buy?
That's a good idea. It's extra money so do what you want!
That's awesome! How long has it been since you've seen him?
Oh_comma_ that sucks then. I hope you guys get along and squash beef?
I am sorry_comma_ that sounds gross
I hate that smell
Nice! Thinking about it...I'm 22 and still don't know how to change a tire hahah
I should learn how to do it_comma_ it seems pretty basic?
Nice_comma_ tell him congrats. What did he major in?
He should become an English teacher1
How much did you lose
I am sure you will make it
Why?
Why would he do that??
What is her name?
That;s cute. I love the cute names people give their pets.
Don't feel guilty. We all slip sometimes.
Ha Ha. Just try to do better next time.
What was the menu?
I bet she loved it!
What's wrong?
I hope so too. I'm sorry that he is going through that.
A lot of kids these days are addicted to technology. Does she listen to you often?
That sucks. How old is she because if she is young she may grow out of it
That's great. Sometimes family isn't good with loans.
Was it pretty far down before?
Wow_comma_ they are still making them? Only ones I enjoyed was MW1_comma_ MW2_comma_ and BO1.
I actually did buy that one on Steam but it barely has any players :(
What is your favorite dish?
I've heard of that dish before. I need to try it sometime_comma_ can I come?!
I bet you find someone soon
I have been there too_comma_ it will get better
Sounds like she's going to be on "Master Chef" in a couple of years. What did she make?
That's wise - it's irresponsible to let kids meander in the kitchen alone. Too many sharp objects.
Thats sounds promising.
Sometimes people think they don't need to study_comma_ but it really is helpful even if you think you know the material
Aww_comma_ that's sweet of her! You're lucky to have her_comma_ not all moms are good.
That's good_comma_ I'm sure she enjoys seeing you happy and taken care of.
That's pretty sweet of her. Some people would find it annoying that their parents still want to baby them_comma_ but I say you shouldn't take it for granted. They just want to be in your life.
Well_comma_ let her know here and there how much you appreciate it. Sometimes we forget that even though we think and feel certain things_comma_ it's not always obvious to the other person. They need some verbal confirmation of appreciation!
Eating vegetables is disgusting to me so I just blend it all in a smoothie. You should try that
Honestly_comma_ I have no idea. But it beats eating vegetables 1 by 1 because that takes forever
I hate that feeling. Hopefully you will feel better about it tomorrow.
You can always start again tomorrow.
Well at least after the storm_comma_ there will be some sunshine!
That's where earmuffs or plugs come in handy my friend
That is horrible luck!  At least you weren't hurt.  Some insurance companies cover that as well_comma_ so you should check.
Hopefully that little mishap doesn't cot you anuthing!
Oooo_comma_ that sounds fun. Will you visit that giant place where gladiators fought?
Well_comma_ now I know where I want to visit too. Great idea!
Hey_comma_ I just saw that trailer! I'm kind of excited for it too since I loved him as a kid. But I felt like the trailer had a few dumb lines it_comma_ even though I love Tom Hardy.
You're right_comma_ he was pretty good as Bane. Glad to see someone else is a fan and is looking forward to it.I see it getting a lot of negativity.
I agree_comma_ I love that feeling. What do you do for work?
Nice_comma_ I bet it sucks when it's blazing hot outside.
Who did you invite?
Where was the party?
October? I thought most Call of Duty games come out in November?
It will be October as soon as you know it_comma_ trust me. Hopefully they release a beta so we can play it earlier.
I have not seen it yet_comma_ tell me abnout it
That sounds insane honestly.
Wow.Really? What kind?
What's your uncle's number? lol
Cool. Say hi to your new Auntie! 
Happens a lot to me actually_comma_ it's sometimes enough to make me sad.
Yeah_comma_ I get like that. I sometimes drive somewhere just to get the feeling I used to have there. Crazy how life goes.
I'm sorry you were dissappointed.  It is hard to spend so much money on a dud movie.  Was the popcorn good at least?
It's always good to save money_comma_ but still_comma_ it stinks.  They should have to make them good for the prices they charge.
Wow_comma_ she is a keeper. What car is it?
Congratulations on the strong marriage and car!
I know you will be great in the end.
People do that sometimes_comma_ and it is really sad.
Why? What happens on Christmas eve for you?
Ohhh_comma_ duh! I should have seen that coming lol
That's too bad. Are you thinking about going to court for it?
Yeah_comma_ that's a load of whack. I hope you win your case and show those pigs who's boss.
Well that's disappointing. Have you been working there longer then your co-worker?
I believe in you!!
My friends and family always talk about that show_comma_ is it good? 
I heard it's really graphic and a lot of sex scenes. I will watch it...for educational purposes.
Ive been there
Just imagine if you found a mix tape on an actual cassette
Are you sure it wasn't palying dead?
Eww_comma_ what the heck! I guess you really were at a bad place at the time.
I'm sure you will knock it out of the park. What is it on?
That's neat - I like economics as well. Why are you so gung-ho about it?
Why?
Oh_comma_ then don't feel bad? I think the teacher is trying to get everyone else involved.
You can always give them some money once you get yourself back on your feet. Just keep your head up - things will get better.
If I ever meet you_comma_ I will toss a few bucks your way. We all have to help each other out in this tough world.
Cool! What did you get?
Well good for you!
Investigate that right now! You need to know
I would not do that_comma_ just get a divorce and take half of all.
wow. I hope you have studied hard so you will do well. 
Well as long as you have studied hard you should do well. Just relax knowing you have prepared yourself. 
Oh my goodness! Did you get hurt?
That's so sad. Did your house get damaged?
Yeah_comma_ that bothers me to.  Don't sweat it too much though.  Just consider it their loss and move on.
There are.  The people who ignore you are not worth your time or effort.
You got this bro_comma_ just be confident. I believe in you
She likes you! If she asks/talks about you then you have a much better chance too.
That is so great! Are you in the process of applying now? I'm sure you will get in eventually.
Perhaps. Or you just need to keep trying. Don't give up on your dreams so easily!
That sounds interesting_comma_ is it hard to make?
Did you really just say that hahaha. You are crazy
That sounds like fun. But I don't think Hillbilly is a very nice way to describe people. 
Funny_comma_ but true. Have you ever been to the races before?
Exciting! Did you get any neat gifts?
It's always good to have friends that know your likes. What is in your collection?
That's always fun. Did you win any money?
Oh darn. Better luck next time.
That is terrible_comma_ are you okay?
I feel super bad about that_comma_ i wish the best for you.
I believe in you_comma_ man. I'm a bit rotund myself_comma_ but I started hitting the gym this past week.
Yeah! By the end of the year_comma_ we'll be lifting Ford F 150's!
For what? Are you a diver or something?
Oh_comma_ well good luck. Have you heard of Wim Hof? He's like a world record breath holder and he does it in freezing temperatures too. 
My dog does that too. I think it's the loud noises that scare them. 
Lol_comma_ if only we can understand dogs and listen to what they are saying. That would be hilarious.
Haha. These dogs that I'm dog-sitting wouldn't let that happen. They wake me up at 6:30AM every morning to feed them. But hey_comma_ we make mistakes. Maybe you had a busy day today.
Ah_comma_ hate's a strong word. They're smarter than we give them credit for. They know you always feed them. At the end of the day_comma_ I doubt she could have a much better owner
What is a aardvark?
I thought so. The name alone sounds so exotic_comma_ were you mad that you had to clean pooop?
You usually don't get that much jail time for drunk driving if it is your first incident. It shouldn't be so bad_comma_ but hopefully it will make you more cautious in the future.
Oh wow. I really hope that you get the help you need. I can relate though...I used to be reckless like that a couple years back. Just have to be responsible and arrange an uber or some other form of transportation.
Oh_comma_ I am so sorry to hear that. Did you get her something nice?
That was very thoughtful_comma_ something to keep her entertained when she wasn't feeling well. Is she doing better?
That's gross.
Thanks for that information.
That's so nice! Did she like your craftsmanship?
It was still a nice gesture. I would love my children to build be a big ole gazebo.
Nice! Did you manage to snag the promotion?
It's good to work hard for that dough. What's your new billet entail?
Oh my goodness! I bet that was embarrassing. But it happens. 
eventually they will forget. They will probably do something even more embarrassing then the joke will be on them. haha.
That is nice. What kind of computer did he get?
I wish I had a better computer. Why do they have to cost so much?
How did that experience go?
I'm very glad_comma_ and I understand how the memories are.
I would too.  What had happened?
Yes.  Did they admit fault?
How old are your kids?
Are you worried they are going to be abducted or something?
What can you lose?
You do. I mean it can only go one of two ways. And if it goes one way_comma_ you can try again with another girl.
Do they have insomnia?
Well they will have insomnia and sore bottoms haha
That happened to me too when I was in elementary school. I lost all my friends and had to make new ones_comma_ which sucks.
I agree.
I bet she felt really special!
I can relate to that!
Me too. I miss payments sometimes because I forget about them and I'm lazy.
That's my exact situation too.
Ah_comma_ so you're in the same boat as me? I can understand how that goes. Electricity is so necessary nowadays_comma_ too.
I'm with you. Sometimes responsibilities get too overwhelming and you feel like you have to hide from them. At some point though_comma_ I'm sure you and I will improve.
Smoking is pretty bad for everyone.
You have to try_comma_ it could change your life.
I like dogs
How many do you have?
Can you get another job?
Can you take out a loan?
Yankees fan_comma_ huh? I should pit you against my brother. He loves the Red Sox. I bet you guys would argue for a while.
Haha_comma_ he'd probably say the same thing to you. He's been a fan of them for about 20 years. What about you? How long have you followed them?
That sucks_comma_ how old were they?
Wow_comma_ how old are the kids?
IT;s sad but I think so too.
Congratulations. We don't share the same sentiment.
Have you asked him how he feels about that entire situation?
Life is a scary place_comma_ anything could happen at any time.
Really? That's one of the saddest things I've heard in a while. I'm sorry to hear that. What happened to your family_comma_ if you don't mind me asking?
I am terribly sorry to hear that. You've got to be really resilient to deal with that. Maybe you could volunteer at a soup kitchen during Thanksgiving so you could have a chance to be around others?
Did you do anything after she did it?
I have never had siblings_comma_ so not sure what to tell ya.
Why's that? Did you specifically have a bad experience with them_comma_ or just assume they're terrible no matter what?
Trapped in a cave? I couldn't handle that. I'm claustrophobic. I'd freak out in a second. How long were you trapped for?
Some people are just cruel.
You should have called the police. If they were just vandals they probably did it to someone else to.
That's annoying. Kids these days are really attached to electronics_comma_ just how it goes. I know it's hard to cut them off_comma_ but have you tried managing his electronics time more closely?
I would be_comma_ too. At that age_comma_ they don't understand why they can't have it. It's like talking to a brick wall. I hope it gets easier for you as he gets older.
Did you practice first in a parking lot?
Did you use GPS?
I can understand that.  I feel like Trump should have gone to jail a long time ago
I totally agree with you
I think they are just empty threats but you never know.
You and me both. 
Why don't you move back?
Can you make new friends where you are now?
Oh no! How many days left until she starts school?
Wow_comma_ that's some really slow shipping times. Maybe you will get lucky and they will come in the mail sooner.
I am totally with you
I am sure you could
How old is he?
Wow_comma_ you can teach an old dog new tricks.
Indeed. It would be fun to see your friends again and be around them
I think being with children is a joy that not everybody can understand
How much is the phone?
Will you be able to pay that off quick thou?
Oh no. Did it ever come back?
That sucks. MY sisters dog used to roam the neighborhood a lot and one day he didn't come back either. His name was Oreo. I told my daughter he got married.
Where did you go?
I love New Orleans.
Awwww  i can relate to that.  I am so sorry.
I am very sorry to hear that
Who was it?
That was nice of them.
I'm not too fond of winter_comma_ but what kind of coat did you buy?
Awesome_comma_ I bet it's comfy! How cold does it get where you live?
When does he start?
I am sure he will have fun.
You may have more than you know but sometimes meeting new people will give you the fresh start you need
Neighbors_comma_ co-workers.  Try and get involved in local sports or comunity groups.  How about volunteering.  That is a good way to meet people that are positive
Where did they come from?
Where did they go?
I'm not particularly a fan of subways either_comma_ but why are you so scared of being robbed?
I think the overall chances of that are pretty low. Though I do understand your fear.
So I take it you get along well with your boss?
That's great to hear_comma_ often times we here of people who hate their bosses!
That really is disappointing.  Can you fix it?
I am so sorry to hear that
Did you hurt yourself?
I am sure they have fallen before_comma_ no big deal.
I'm sorry to hear that. Why do you think that is? Is it a painful or happy memory?
I can understand that. That does sound like a difficult thing to deal with. Hopefully you have a lot of nice memories you can look back on to remember her by.
It is these delicate balance of our natural body that makes us to be diligent for survival
Indeed. Nature is very interesting and complex to interpret. Survival is the only mechanism that drive us to have certain physical features
I bet that was a nice surprise! That's pretty cool. What was it for_comma_ if you don't mind me asking?
That's really cool... And also way above my head! But seriously_comma_ that sounds like smart_comma_ hard work. You should be proud. I'm glad you got that "moment in the sun."
Wow_comma_ that's amazing! Shows that we can't judge a book by it's cover. We automatically think it would take a large man to do something like that!
I would have been unable to move for the rest of the day!
Dang_comma_ that's rough. Like a double-dose of sadness. My girlfriend and I are long distance_comma_ so I know how that goes. Is there any way you can still keep in touch with them?
Yeah_comma_ she and I don't use social media_comma_ but I can imagine that'd be really helpful in your case. Well_comma_ I'm glad you at least have that. And maybe it will open up the possibility for you to meet new people_comma_ too.
Well_comma_ we don't like unnecessary attention_comma_ and we don't like talking about ourselves. We just like skyping between each other_comma_ and that's it. And talking on the phone_comma_ of course.
Was it for school?
Did you get fired due to it?
That is a little daunting.  Have you considered joining some groups with like-minded individuals?
Check with your community center
Aww! How sweet! I can imagine the first few days are crazy.
I do not have any kids. Honestly too scared for child birth haha
Aw_comma_ that is fantastic! How did yall meet?
Wow_comma_ you guys meet pretty early on. That's nice that you pretty much grew together as you became adults.
Hopefully a happy birthday is going to be in order soon!
Happy early birthday then.  Drink up!
Oh really! Any ideas why?
Maybe they like you?
Yes_comma_ they can be fun I guess.
Yes that could be very annoying.
That is so sad. Did the kitten die? I hope not.
Oh_comma_ I hope it was ok. I understand you not being able to stop.
No joke? That's terrible. Why was the security camera off? And seriously_comma_ who steals a lawn mower? What bums.
Oh_comma_ that makes sense. I had no idea_comma_ since I've never used them. That sounds really inconvenient. Maybe they were waiting for the perfect moment to strike... What chumps.
Oh wow_comma_ what luck! I bet you slowed down after that!
Well that's good that you use this as a reason to stop speeding. Some people never learn!
I love Colorado.
Did you have fun?
It is. Now we have to deal with rains and snows. So much to go for the next summer
I think climate change will only exacerbate the freezing temperatures during winter season
Why did you decide not to go?
Did you make it to the game at least?
What is the big end goal?
I think you can do it.
That's not good. What's wrong?
Oh man_comma_ that would make me angry! Is there anyone you can call and report them anonymously?
Maybe you can sneak over and steal them?
oh no that would make me feel guilty!!! Is he okay?
is he allergic to that type of food? If not you need to transition him slowly! But that's funny lol
Who did you leave him with?
Did he destroy the house?
That sounds great.  What do you get to visit for?
That sounds like a great experience!
I was too! What do you think caused it?!
I agree with you. Having a good coach is crucial for team success.
What state is that?
That does surprise me actually.
I'm sorry to hear that. It always sucks missing the good old days.
I can kind of see where you're coming from. I personally try to avoid too much nostalgia. Others seem to love it.
That is incredible. What a determination and dedication he must have put for achieving such a result
I wish I had that level of willpower to even lose a couple of pounds from my hanging waist fat
Wow_comma_ I have never been! What all did you see?
Oh cool. What was you favorite thing at the square? 
A part in what?
What play is it?
That is rough news.  How long?
That is hard.  I am so sorry
What kind of puppies?
Why don't you buy one from your friend?
oddly enough so am I. I just want to be comfortable. How do you feel about that?
That's very good_comma_ do you feel content at the moment?
Did you spill something on it?
Did you hurt yourself?
Are you excited about it?
I hope you have a great time!
Maybe you should take a different class.
You will have to study harder then.
Especially getting gifts from family. What a special holiday this is
How weird it may seem_comma_ but my mom still gives me children's book as a gift for each Christmas
Awww that is sad but happy al at the same time!
I hear that.  You hang in there
does that usually happen often? 
haha yeah it happens to me too. I bet you're frustrated about that. Have you tried different apps?
I know what you mean. It is always a reason to be proud.
I just set short term goals along the way.
What does he do for work?
Well you could always pick up a new hobby! What is something you've always wanted to learn?
Me too
Oh_comma_ man. Why is that?
That is wonderful to hear
Don't ever forget why!
What time is it at?
Make sure you get there early.
Why is that?
Have you spoke to her?
Oh yeah me too man_comma_ you like the fall?
Yeah me too it's very comfortable. What else do you think about it?
Why do you think that is?
I love my dog_comma_ i still cheat on it.
How much did you win?
Do you have any of it left?
Yes_comma_ I prefer the fall also.
That football starts.
I'm sorry about your loss. How are you doing?
What exactly happened?
That's great! What makes you so confident?
Well that awesome to hear! I hope you do get it soon!
Gold club where?
How many holes does it have?
Oh no!  What does he do that is so annoying?
It is nice that he wants to stay connected I guess
Who are you going with?
Nice_comma_ have they been before?
you were? Was your pregnancy planned
hahah oh man finally that is so good! Congratulations on your children
Oh no! Have you bought a test yet? Were you trying?
Thats scary! I hope that you aren't pregnant then!!
I hope so
What is the disagreement about?
I agree. What do you think will help people get along?
Yes when I was little.
I also had a dog_comma_ did you find your dog?
That is terrible_comma_ i would cry as well.
you can always adopt_comma_ thats what we did!
What kind?
Nice_comma_ was model is it?
Oh_comma_ wow! That's awesome that your friend unexpectedly surprised you. 
I bet that was really heartwarming. I'm glad you had that experience. 
Tell me about it. I got like 3 hours last night
Hey! Girlfriends just need an ear some time. 
you can do whatever you want!! You like beer?
oh okay I see lol chugging reminds me of high school
What do you do with her?
Is she still alive?
Yes you will with that attitude
That is the key isnt it?
Congratulations! You and your family must be delighted to have a new member!
I am sure that you will be a great parent. You clearly show that you already love your new born daughter.
I would cry_comma_ very much!
I would cry and cry for days.
Worms? yuck!
But you just said you do like them.
What are you going to buy?
What store will you go to?
I had to use a subway once to get to work on time.
It was ok_comma_ but while on the train I lost my phone and somebody returned it to me.
Do you enjoy your free time or are you sad?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Cool_comma_ I have a pair of jeans.
When will you wear them?
Did you get sleepy while studying?
i would have fallen asleep for sure.
I live and take care of my grandmother too!
Yea_comma_ I feel that it is worth every second of it! They are the reasons we exist
That is understandable.  You need to let it happen naturally. Be with your friends and find yourself
I understand.  It will happen for you if you keep an open mind and don't rush
did you not want to leave them with someone else?
it is did you have fun?
Vegas is always a popular destination for vacation!
Clubs are so fun! Any specific ones in mind?
That's terrible! How did you punish your dog?
Maybe your dog has learned it's lesson.
What happened on it?
Wow_comma_ sounds like you have good fiends_comma_ and it was fun.
That's good. Some people don't appreciate anything.
That's a blessing too. I happy that my family is healthy too.
Oh no!  What happened?
That is really ridiculous that they shut it off over just $1 though!
Aww_comma_ that's a nice story. I'm glad you have that to carry with you.
I'm thinking of a time that a party was thrown for me as a surprise. All those people getting together was really fun.
These nostalgic emotions are unique and very pleasant to have. I sometimes rewind them in my mind just to escape from my anxiety
Old memories that are good tend to help me emotionally and mentally. Not those that were distressing
Did you ask why your partner refused. That is very weird.
That is okay_comma_ at least she was honest with you about her preferences.
I would guess that if your survival mode you will do whatever you have to.
I would like to think that I wouldn't but if it were that or die_comma_ I'd eat.
What happened? Did you?
That's perfect then_comma_ i'm sure you did a great job@
Tell me exactly what that was like? Hopefully it's different now?
I could not even imagine how mad your parents must be.
Nice! I bet it is a very cute puppy.
That is just adorable! You should take many photos before it grows too big!
yes i am mortified jeans ripped
 i am working
Woah! That is great news. Have you told anyone yet?
I don't blame you at all. You just received life changing news.
You are so right. It can make all the difference.
It is challenging to raise children. Everybody could use a hand.
I feel the same way. There are so many people who are struggling now.
It's such a difficult situation that you just don't know where to begin.
Great@  So you found out already that you got it or are you just confident?
that is upsetting.  I am sorry to hear that
ok you going to your family
no
That can be upsetting. Did they tell you why?
Maybe it's time to look for another job.
That is impressive.  Why did you doubt them?
Is it something you are happy with?
I hate interviews the most.
Sure you can_comma_ work for yourself!
Is there any emergency need for money?
It's our responsibility to take care of our parents. 
That is great1
You must have been so proud!
Kids are amazing. How old are they?
Great ages to have lots of fun with.
That is fantastic.  What for?
That is awesome!
What does that mean exactly?
I would love a vacation!
Ps4 is the best system to play on!
I love beating others.
Can you be more specific about what things you had lost in the past?
So you consider yourself a general loser in life?
I am with you.  It is horrendous
I agree with you
Is it still there? 
It sounds like that experience made a lot of amazing memories for you.
I can understand that.  Were you by yourself?
that is good to hear
I wouldn't be so sure of that. Even the best trained dogs can run when given a reason.
Ha Ha. They all are until they run.
That is nice.  What show?
That is really cool
Because of the movie or where you were parked?
It must have been really good to keep you scared afterwards.
That's awesome! what was the project?
you must be very clever
I just got Netflix back.  What is good?
That sounds good.  
Oh no. Thats sad. What was wrong?
Im sorry. That must have been hard_comma_
I could never ever sing.
I can barely even talk!
Oh_comma_ What was your age when you've stolen?
It's happening all around. If we're repeating the same_comma_ it'll become a bad habit.
They may consider that shoplifting. It would be terrible to go to jail for grapes.
I think I would stop doing that. Jail doesn't appeal to me.
Cool. Are they still the same?
Are you gonna get together again?
Did you party after?
I partied like crazy after graduation.
Don't be daft! Kids should never watch tv!
They have tv inside the school do they not?
Even I love anime and i stopped watching tv a few years ago_comma_ maybe I shall return.
Why is that?
Well that's understandable.
What kind of job was it?
Oh wow!  I have actually worked there too
I love apple pie. I feel you.
You brought yourself. I am a glass half full type of lady lol
You are  lucky to be able to have that kind of relationship. 
You have a strong foundation. Even if she wavers she will return.
We will see. Don't worry so much.
Good for you. I like a positive attitude.
I hate when that happens
Being courteous isnt that hard. People just dont try
Yeah? What do you need to buy?
How many kids do you have?
Cool What are you going to do?
Well thats good if its quiet.
Why and what did happen?
Oh_comma_ be positive_comma_ try your best.
Why?
Oh well it wasnt on purpose. People lose things.
Really? Why? They're so small.
Oh no! Have you put traps down?
Ok. Had any interviews yet?
Lol. Well good luck. Job searches can be tough.
You will.
Those are the kind you better keep a watch on. You never know what he might do.
Don't engage with him he will think that your interested.
Is the coworker your friend?
You probably shoulf have told them that wasnt a decent thing to do. 
why
ok
I hope it is - do you have any funny experiences from the bad ones?
I'm sorry to hear that. You'll find somebody good soon!
Really? Are you watching training?
Oh you mean soccer lol
I will agree with you there. We use whatever words we want.
How exciting for you. 
There's always hope in a new beginning.
What was the movie? Save me
Well thanks for nothing lol
I've never had a pair either - but I don't despise them. Why do you feel so strongly?
Yeah - I don't see why someone would spend so much either.
Maybe we're just jealous!
Wow. I have never even tried. Seems complicated.
Maybe I will try one day.
What do you make best?
Never even had it before.
congrats
ya i am interesting to help for people
That's a hard thing to deal with. Do you think she's really hungry?
Maybe her body clock is out of whack.
Whos playing?
Omg. I love her. 
Do you have any of your own?
I'm sure you would with all that experience!
Wow. Was it intersting?
I have no idea who that is. Sorry.
Football or soccer?
Whats your favorite team?
Why do you hide snacks from your kids?
That does not seem very nice.
That's good to hear.
That's good that you can get through and hopefully still care about each other.
I hope you can find the peace and keep up whatever friendship you may have.
That's great. I understand sometimes we might need distance as well. But being cool with the other person is nice to see. 
Right now?
Oh man! I feel sorry for you. What time is it where you are - 1am?
What happened?
Shame on you. 
Oh wow. Maybe you dodged a bullet.
Me too lol
Is it? Do you like dressing up then? Or is it the tricks?

Excellent!
Did you have fun?
I bet I enjoyed it when I was 30 and pregnant!

That's good he is nice like that.
What kind of test?
Biology isnt as easy as I thought either.
Good luck. Whats the job?
Cool. Ive done that before.
Does she? Do you want me to break her kneecaps for you?
Me too. It's not fair. Just message me her address and $1000 and I'll do it :-)
Yeah? I'm sorry to hear that. Are you looking for someone else? (Does that sound sleazy_comma_ lol?)
Oh dear. Maybe you don't need a man - I'm one and can confirm that they are messy_comma_ noisy and rude.
It sure can.
DEfinitely
I hate that.
People should be more considerate though.
Jeesh_comma_ was she not paying attention in class_comma_ or is there some other issue?
I couldn't imagine my kid going so far as to hide something like that from me. Maybe she was just scared of how you would react.
Well you tend to be a bit overly serious about things_comma_ maybe you should try looking at the issue from her point of view you know?
She is a kid man_comma_ kids mess up. I can't imagine you were a beacon of honesty when you were a kid. 
Thats cool.
Oh. You're welcome lol
I read your journal
Im sldo in your closet
Really? Why is that?
Oh no! How does that make you feel?
I know right
I know exactly what you mean.
Why are you done with voting?
You shouldn't give up on your government.
I hate horror films Too many nightmares.
Whose idea were those anyway?
Oh no
That was nice. 
Probably Im scared of birds.
It flies. I am afraid of butterflies. Seriously
Well its to be expected_comma_ all you do is sit in your house on the weekends. 
Well next weekend come out with me and the rest of the group_comma_ bet we could find you a few interested guys.
Well lets not aim too high. How about we start with good looking and go from there.
Oh shoot! What happened_comma_ are you okay?
What happened? I thought you guys were attached at the hip? 
I feel really sorry for you. Will you be okay?
I hope everything works out for you.
That's nice_comma_ do you get nervous?
That's great_comma_ do you have a warm up routine to get your ready?
Cool_comma_ what do you do if you happen to be low on energy?
Makes sense!
oh why?
Was it an important appointment?
I haven't seen it_comma_ but I know a lot of people like it. 
Sounds good_comma_ were you said throughout the series or because of an ending?
I appreciate that! I wish I had watched it so you could talk more about it. 
What about it is annoying? Isnt it better for the dog?
that does not seem safe for anyone. Is there anything you can do about it?
I'm sorry to hear that. Are you OK?
Oh man. That's so sad.
That sounds like fun.
I love the sunshine_comma_ it's great.
Why is that?
I can understand that viewpoint. It's a very complicated issue though!
Well done! Do you get a prize or anything?
That's great. Keep up the good work
Why do you think you often feel that way?
Do you have any friends around that area?
Why is that?
That IS annoying.
That is wonderful_comma_ good food makes for happy people
thats my favorite food too! no wonder it was lovely. you should cook italian food often then
Why not? That doesn't sound fun.
I'm sorry the hear that_comma_ maybe next time.
Absolutely. What happened?
That's bad. Did any charges get pressed?
What kind of job do you want?
Accounting jobs are usually high paying j.
Oh_comma_ wow. That's awful_comma_ I'm sorry!
I understand. Will your insurance help you?
What was the hard work?
Good. WEll done then.
Wow!  Never mind_comma_ the best is reserved  for the last
Don't give up! 
What did she say?
Congratulations. That's amazing!
That is great news.  He must be lucky.
It seems like everything worked out for him.
Afraid of what?
Can you provide more details?
ok

What do you mean?
really - do you feel confident?
So what  made it fondly? 
Nice!  Was it on a summer time? 
Congrats. You must be very proud of yourself. Will you celebrate?
I agree_comma_ be sure to keeping up the good work! 
Oh no_comma_ what happened to the car?
Wow_comma_ that is so disgusting.
I agree. I thinking making a list helps with that.
I like to have a set of goals for the week to accomplish.
Did you mess on the order?
Wow.You must feel angry about that
That sounds amazing_comma_ good for you!
How surprised were you about it?
I hope you didnt get any bad news from the doctor.
I am sorry to hear that. Hopefully its a treatable disease! 
Uhmnn_comma_ so how do you  think  she would react? 
Anyway  you have to find a way of better explaining  _comma_hope he'll  understand? 
That is unfortunate. You must have really angry to have wasted your time.
It has happened to me as well. Its very annoying when it happens.
What did he do to you?
You should not lend money to anyone_comma_even if it is your friend
Really - are you scared of missing it?
Me too - I get very stressed if there's even a chance of being late.
That shouldn't be allowed in the first place.
Oh my. I would be angry if that happened too.
What?  Was that freezed to have stayed that long? 
Uhmmnn!  That's awful!  
What game were you playing?
Wow_comma_ I am so happy for you!
Good job! A good education is great for your future.
It is very much worth it in the long run.
Congratulation. Good job.
Good. Self confidence is important. When did you get the promotion?
Oh my. How did that happen? I hope no one was hurt
Does your insurance cover fire damage?
OK get prepared! 
Well_comma_ can only wish you luck!  You need to be bold 
Is it not about 2 years away?
OK - are you going to go to Tokyo to see it?
Am so sorry_comma_  how did you handle it?
That can be tiresome. I hope you had it all handled at the end
That's terrible_comma_ will you be able to stay in school?
Well_comma_ I hope you do better this year.
yes it appears a trade war might happen now!
I agree_comma_ he needs to stop isolating the U.S.
That is a great surprise. Did you drive it?
You are very lucky.
It ran away? Better make sure can't do that again. Stressful 
I can imagine so
I am in the US. Why does it make you so angry? I've never heard about.
I think I will_comma_ I'm very curious now. You think they would want to use their time more wisely.
Oh man that's a good way to end up on the couch.
You better find a way to make that up to her.
Why is that? Is it your favorite type of car?
I see_comma_ turn that jealousy into motivation to get that Acura!
Congratulations. We have a boy on the way. 3 months to go!
I remember my surprise too. She tricked me all day and said she wasn't pregnant.
Well_comma_ that really  bad!  
Well _comma_that goodness you were not caught_comma_ that would have been expulsion 
The customized version of what?
Oh okay. What kind of car is it?
Oh wow that seems like a bad situation. 
Is there another company that may be able to help you?
What a happy time I bet you were very prouod and excited!! :-
Yay that is awesome! Sometimes not knowing the gender of the baby is a very cool surprise they say.
Nice!  What is your favorite dish that she taught you?
Awww I am sorry.  At least she showed you how to make it!
Oh wow. That sounds like me and my husband!
That would make me mad_comma_ too. How hard is it to throw stuff away?
That makes me so sad. Why is that so?
yes that can be a huge problem. I'm so sorry you're having to go through that.
Of course_comma_ I've felt sad for many reasons. Things that happen in the world make me sad.
What makes me sad is hunger in the world. I cannot stand people suffering.
That is a reason to be sad but also to be furious
All people are the same.I understand why you feel ver sad and I guess frustrated too
Sorry to hear that. Why is that?
That must have been very upsetting. It happened to me back in 6th grade.
So did you get in trouble for it?
That would make me so mad!   I wouldn't even want to go to work!
That is pretty gross but it happens often.
If you plan on having a kid it will happen.
That sounds like so much fun!
I like the little roller coasters myself.
have they offered to buy you a replacement?
Thats not a very good friend then. accidents happen but you should own up to them :/ have you considered suing in small claims? youd at least get your money back to get a new phone
Sorry to hear that.IS she going to be under treatment?
Thats pretty kind of you.WHat is the doctor saying?
Yes_comma_ they are. They keep us motivated.
My main one is to become a mother. I also want to be out of debt ASAP.
Have you talked to him about being a bit cleaner in general?
Ah that's a tough situation. Maybe some subtle hints would work best_comma_ like leaving a deodorizer near his room.
Oh that sounds like fun! What kind of film did you see?
Action films on the big screen are very exciting with the loud sounds and visual effects!!
Do you want to do something special today?
you can read something
That must've been hard. I love my dad the most of all family members
I'm glad to hear that.
What did happen in the store? Why did your daughter throw a fit?
Oh_comma_ did you convince her?
thats so adorable! how old is he? 
i bet i would be too 
oh cool how much was it? 
holy! thats a lot but she will get good use out of it 
tell me more about this
oh my god 
Well done. You must be very proud of him.
Football is pretty much the only sport I like.
How did you feel_comma_ relieved or disappointed?
Did they reschedule?
And what happened then?
Congrats. You must be very proud of yourself.
What did you do instead? 
well you could always take him out or do something he would like to make up for it im sure he wont mind 
I am sure that brought back memories
I do love those kind of memories
What are you worried about?
Ahh_comma_ well I am sure you will have blast!
Oh no! Are you ok?
I'm sorry to hear that. What caused the fire?
Oh_comma_ tell me what happened.
That sounds like a very eventful day!
thats so cool where were you when you seen that? 
i would have been too thats really cool 
that happens to everyone
i hope she forgave you
Well done to you. Its not so easy to lose weight. What motivated you?
Having a good looking body is not just to look good its also a reflection of a healthy life. You should try and keep it.
It's a good attitude_comma_ it keeps you young
keep like this ... happy
I've been there. That must be rough. What's going on ?
I am happy you worked it out. Stay loyal to each other. It's the most important thing
What are you overwhelmed by
I am sure it will begin soon
omg.. sounds terrible.. do you usually get storms like that in your area? 
it sounds like it well i am glad everyone is okay 
I'm sorry_comma_ how did she take it?
Hopefully she will forgive you for it.
It must have been quite interesting. Did it make you feel hungry?
Oh my_comma_ I can see why. It must have been very noisy and animal-like
Then? 
Where are you camping? 
Who did? And I'm sorry to hear that.
I am sorry for your loss. 
thats a terrible situation you are in has it been resolved? 
Yeah that sounds really bad! 
I see_comma_ it will be alright. You just have to be positive!
You must be feel a bit guilty_comma_ but thats okay
How long did he study for? 
awesome good for him... what will his career choice me now? 
I am sure they will do fine
She sounds creative
That is an example of an awesome parent.  It is good to know he has got your back!
I am sure it really helped your self confidence and feelings of worth.
That sounds so annoying
Just be civil as much as you can
Well_comma_ it is a good thing you had so much faith in your father.
It is good you had someone so reliable in your life.
I bet you were good at it
That is pretty impressive
Oh wow.  Have you ever been in a torando?
People tend to say that...which makes me more curious and wanting to be in one haha
I'm sorry_comma_ I think it's an opportunity to start a new job better
that's right ... but you have to keep going ... I know that you will do well
... I congratulate you ... it's good news!
that gives a lot of confidence ....
i believe this story please tell me ore
such a manly thing to do dont you agree ?
So...what did you do
smart
That sounds like a blast. Who are you going to see?
That is fun_comma_ is it an inside thing or outside?
whaaat that is insane! Alright he must be doing something really LEGAL right? lol 
some people really are like that though. I am not one of those people tho. 
I agree but you do not need much in life to be happy if you are a content person
i am happy for you
Maybe_comma_ but maybe not. I bet it would be a lot of fun to have such a nice pool if you had the money for it. 
I mean I would never be able to afford that but if they can then it is nothing for them to do the routine care.
did he ?
you have a great dad
wow i closed 2 weeks ago
it truly is
were you drunk? 
lol well atleast you are honest! 
hope he takes care of it
you are a good friend_comma_  i would never let my friend borrow mine
that literally makes no sense like i get it you are homeless but no reason to be dirty! ugh 
probably so either way still disgusting 
Well_comma_ go ahead_comma_ know that women are an art_comma_ that you get many attempts
quiet_comma_ we're like that ... you're right
You're not alone I've got a bunch of debt to pay off
For now I just sweep it under the rug and pretend like it doesn't exist. So after that point my life is pretty much perfect
i am so proud of you_comma_ keep it up 
you are probably older now as well
Sometimes you've gotta live with regrets.  Accept it as part of your past life and move on
Same I've put my parents through a lot.  But now I'm trying to be the best version of myself so I can eventually pay them back
that is a very positive way to think i wish i could think like you 
ill try my best and see where it gets me 
I know_comma_ it's awful! How much did your rent go up?
Wow...You need to find a new place to live because that's completely unreasonable.
That's gross! Did you complain to your landlord?
Wow_comma_ that's pretty bad. I would complain to someone higher up_comma_ because that's just disgusting! 
you sound so motivated_comma_ that's really great! I believe in you
It does motivate me too! 
I do remember that and I think there is a lot of nostalgia there
I love things that remind me of my childhood_comma_ it is even more fun to share it with our kids
Really! What was it?
That sounds amazing! What was in the box???
I think most people are really.  Anything specific about it?
Yeah_comma_ that's a scary thought.  I try to think about what I can leave behind_comma_ and hope there's something past death.
Oh_comma_ that's awful. What will you do to make it right?
Yeah_comma_ I think that's a good idea. I hope it all turns out for good.
Oh no!  It seems as though everything turned our OK_comma_ right?  I am sure you were strong!
That is great!  It was all worth it in the end.
Oh my!  I am glad to hear you managed to avoid the collision.
Young people never appreciate the danger of speeding.
what are you getting done
ouch _comma_ gargle some whiskey
give her an unlocked phone 
is she being billed for data though ?
that's not nice of them. is that parking lot assigned to you?
they should be nicer! i'm sorry they are so inconsiderate
Wow_comma_ you're so well spoken. 
so how do you better yourself?
Maybe there is rain in the forecast
Probably a lot are on vacation  _comma_especially now.
I'm sorry to hear that.  Did they replace the plant as well?
I hope it comes back.  Fertilizer is always an experimental thing. Plants are so finicky.
Oh wow! I remember my parents getting them so much. Why would someone need that now?
Possibly_comma_ but I doubt it could be worth anything. I would have thrown it out.
did you cry ?
i love the old days as well
Oh my_comma_ that must have been super embarrassing. Did you get red faced?
Did you ask for her number afterwards?
That seemed nice of her_comma_ maybe she felt bad about something?
Oh so she gave you money to kind of persuade you to do it?
uhhh i know how you feel!! we have some young neighbors downstairs and sometimes they have late night parties in their apartment
tell me about it. i even talked to them several times but they don't care
That must have been amazing to see!  Did you try to scare it away or just watch it?  Be careful since it sounds like it may be dangerous.
Wow!  Definitely be careful then!
That was some bonus. If you go to I think South carolina_comma_ they have a factory somewhere there and they are cheaper I think
A friend got one used down there near Spartanburg.
Aw_comma_ well I'm sure a child that young doesn't really need it.
Well maybe you can practice and get better at it for when your baby is older.
Thats good. One should always appreciate family.
I see_comma_ healthy relationships should be cherished!
That is fair_comma_ I would be as well
I undertstand that_comma_ I would be very upset as well
That is cool though_comma_ does it still run fine?
Wow_comma_ that is a good run though_comma_ great job keeping it running!
it will
sure
Sorry to hear that. I have lost all my grandparents so I know the feeling. 
Yeah_comma_ it takes a long time to get over .  And it's never easy.
That is so sad_comma_ humans made a huge impact on animals lives in that sense
It makes me feel sick as well_comma_ I hit a bird once and almost cried
That's great. It seems that everything is going well for you.
Thanks. I guess you are quite happy about everything.
wow i am happy for you

I know how you feel.  I have siblings as well.  They are quite important and give life meaning.
That is a great attitude and outlook to have!
I am so sorry to hear that!
I unsderstand that entirely
I've been there_comma_ it can really suck to be lonely.  It sounds like you're doing better though :)
I'm glad to hear it.  It's great to have found someone.
why is that?
Weren't we are like that...
That will be a ton of fun to play!  I rememeber when the first one came out_comma_ what a blast.  Now I have to go get a switch!
What is your favorite game?
I would imagine_comma_ that is a huge event! My favorite game was Zelda by the way
You should_comma_ there are tons of age appropriate games like Mario Kart and Splatoon!
Sounds interesting. I'd love to check that out!
It's a Mario-type game_comma_ isn't it?
Lebron is preparing for life after basketball therefore he picked LA_comma_ he achieved what he wanted 
He doesn't have anything else to prove to anyone
Mine too.  How many do you have?

Thaqt is too bad.  I like cats_comma_ but not the mean ones_comma_ only the sweet ones.  What does the cat do that is so bad?
Yeah_comma_ I wonder what has made it so mean.

Oh my gosh_comma_ how terrible. Did you have them saved on your computer?
I guess you had to redo it all again?
That is terrible_comma_ is it someone you like? or did you not even know her?  I don't know which is worse.
Can you laugh about it now that you look back at it_comma_ or has not enough time passed yet?
Oh my_comma_ did you find out who it was?
You must have been quite relived that it was just your dog!
That is a relief Ive been in a similiar situation.  I know its hard to bring yourself out of a hole_comma_ I can barely see the light at the end of the tunnell
Im struggling myself_comma_ with 5 kids and 1 big kid (my husband) I feel like I should just buy a farm to be able to keep up. LOL

i hope everything will go back to normal asap and i hope he will apologize for making you feel small

Audis are nice cars. What color is it? Does it look newer?
Oh_comma_ nice. Do you have a car?
that is very thoughtful of you
you are very ambitious
about what may I ask?
Is the person someone you know well_comma_ a long time friend_comma_ a family member?
I would talk to your brother and let him know how concerned you are and ask him for reassurance 
That's so nice of them! Was it a surprise party?
Hahaha We take those things for granted! Happy belated birthday!
I can imagine it caught many people off guard.  I hope everyone came out ok in the end.
That's good.  The only thing that matters in the end is our lives and health.

According to my knowledge and understanding_comma_ I believe that you did something really prudent
Moderation in driving is important to avoid dangerous situations

It's alright maybe it's a working day and she has a surprise for you on saturday
Did you check everywhere in the room? maybe she has a surprise  gift hidden somewhere for you to find out
I think you should call the cab company and try to locate the driver!
Yes I will pray as well. But try not to let it bite your conscience. 
but that's so exciting! you will have so many good moments in your new house
I understand. is your new house far from the old one?

That is great that you have that kind of relationship.
Was your house okay?
Good_comma_ being safe is all you can ask for!
My boyfriend just bought a Nintendo Switch last week. It was expensive!

you should go
it could have been worse you know
That is great! I bet they are thrilled! Is that you favorite team?
They are pretty talented.
That sucks.  It's the same for me_comma_ only it's because we recently moved and I don't know anyone outside of work yet.
Ouch.  Were you too busy to go with them?
are they alive or gone ?
yes they will believe in it
I know that was the case for many_comma_ I am sorry that impacted you 
Many people did_comma_ he was a likeable fellow!
That has happened to me_comma_kids are brutal
That is for sure_comma_ with online bullying existing now too
That makes me sad to hear.  Do you have lot's of friends now?
I think it is better to a few really good friends than a lot of acquaintances.
Glad you're doing well
What are three traits that got you to where you are now
Nice talking to ya
I love nintendo and that series
what system do you have
How old were you?
Ah okay_comma_ that makes sense_comma_ at least it was sort of legal!
oh my thats pretty funny
hahaha you are funny
Oh wow that was brave. Did you get caught?
That was pretty risky. Did you get sick?
I saw one for the first time ever too! Where did you see it at?
I was in the US when I saw it thought it has been a while since it happened.
Well that's good news.
What kind of work do you do
Well you shouldn't fear things we have no control over anyway. I'm sorry you feel anxiety over this.
I guess I can agree with that. I don't like it when people criticize millenialls too much though. Baby boomers didn't do that great either.
Why?  What happened??
That stinks.  Are there any other possibilities for advancement coming up?
I know the feeling.I miss my 2 boys also
I imagine_comma_ but i am sure the family will be reunited soon.
Why do you think people would be that irresponsible? 
Not all people would be that way_comma_ and I think for the most part most people would take responsibility for their actions. 
Uh oh. Did he ruin some furniture?
That is too bad. I bet you were not happy.
My brother did too! He's the oldest so he got all the good stuff :(
Aw :( I bet other people appreciate you a lot!
I hear you.  Jokes are one thing_comma_ family is another.
I dunno if I'd go quite that far_comma_ but you do you :P
I bet you were glad you made that purchase!
That was very lucky timing.
It is so frustrating when someone else's issues affect your life.  What does she do to make you late?
That might be a good solution for you.  Let her catch all the flack for her tardiness.
That is absolutely horrible! Was this recent?
I agree. You should bring that up to HR. 
Seems like this speech was very important to you_comma_ why?
Ah-ah_comma_ than it makes a lot of sense.
That's awesome! Are you excited?
How long did it take you to make it?
That's an unfortunate predicament to be in.  What did you end up doing?
That's a tough decision for sure_comma_ but you definitely can't get fired for something like that_comma_ and kids are exposed to germs all the time.
I get nostalgia all the time.  Were they family pictures
Cool.  Do you still keep in touch with those friends
That is a good approach! Has it been successful?
That is great to hear! I am happy for you!
its really more disapponted and hurts a lot.
dont feel everything goes good 
yeah that good 
iam always happy to think about it. my childhood memory was a great part of our life
Nice! Where at
Cool traveling what are your plans so far
Ah_comma_ I've made plenty of dumb choices in my life too. Honestly_comma_ I think it's part of being young
That's good :) But you are the wiser for it
I know. The game was full of intrigue. They truly deserved the win
You should definitely get a tattoo of his name on your chest
I am so sorry to hear that.  Losing a loved one is definitely one of the hardest things in life.
Maybe they just need some time to let the emotions settle a bit.
sounds fun how long were you there
aw what was your favorite things to do while there
Congratulations.  What did you get your degree in?
Good luck with any future business ventures.
I am very sorry for your loss.
A loss is never easy especially one in the family.
That is so cool_comma_ what kind of video game was it?
That is so amazing.  Are you a professional gamer? 
I wish I was that good at gaming.  What a fun way to make a living!
that is a great news_comma_ congratulate him from my side too. what is the major?
If the journey is tough then you are in the right path. So_comma_ she is heading in right way. Great.
Nice! What did you whip up today
I LOVE steak..just had some steak_comma_ brisket and fajitas yesterday
thats an amazing memory to have_comma_ have you since visited her or sent her a card? 
I would call the school and see if they can disclose that or maybe they can accept the card from you to give to her! 
How did it go?
Oh no!  I'm so sorry!  I hope you could pull your grade up!
What a nice person you are! I bet she appreciates you
You have a good set of morals. That's becoming more uncommon lately. So_comma_ good on you!
I am sure the stress will be worth it in the end.  Just keep encouraging him!
Those are good traits to have.  Good for him!
It is a great desire that you can achieve_comma_ just rely on your abilities to independently do what you know.
I wish you can achieve success in your projects.
Did you present?
That is great!
Is it something you enjoy? 
I know we are all different but maybe getting another puppy would help? 
Oh that is so scary! I bet you were terrified!
Were you unharmed though?
Lol _comma_ I think my son has done that _comma_ he use to embrasse me when I would go to the store when he was little by crying a lot 
No any more he is a lot older and does pretty good on his own _comma_ but the thing is he is always close by if we in the store together .Yes I do believe that the human are weird 
I'm guessing you're talking about your son?
Parenting is hard_comma_ respect to you and your patience
That is awful! I hate people who leave their dogs out all day. That's no life for a dog to live at all.
That is terrible. I don't know why people like that bother getting a pet. 
that is so beautiful! how old is she? 
i bet it was omg thats so adorable 
that is so scary.... you must have been terrified your baby too! How are you doing today? 
I cant even begin to imagine honestly im sorry you had to experience that 
That is horrible!  How could they justify doing that?  You must have been disgusted with them!
I can imagine.  I hope it all works out for the best and that you are able to come away from this as a stronger person.
Congrats.  They must be excited.
I am sorry to hear that.   Why are you upset about this?
That is terribly sad. I volunteer at our local shelter. I just love dogs.
That is so happy to hear! It's the nice things like that that make it worth it to volunteer.
Wow_comma_ I bet that was a really big deal!  What was it about?
I hope he did well.
I think a lot of people are.  What in particular astonishes you?
Yes_comma_ he's definitely unpredictable and capricious.  Is there anything about him you do like?
Oh wow that must have kept you awake for a while!
She scared me too_comma_ I hope you're not scarred for life!
I know that feeling.  It's a trip when I look through family albums
Do you still keep in touch with the homies
I would enjoy the peace and quiet!  Kick back_comma_ relax_comma_ and do whatever you want.
Well in that case I hope they come home soon.  My family is just annoying mostly.
I have not_comma_ I was hoping they called you instead.
That sounds like good planning to me.
I do too. I don't like to think about it because I start to feel weird.
That is awesome. Things change a lot out of high school.
Great.Did you decided were to go on your vacations?
I have been there before.Your are gonna have a lot of fun.
what exactly were you referring to
oh try to politely get the truth by speaking in a diplomatic manner by not hurting her ego
That's great! How old is she?
If she is really good she could get a scholarship.
Why did she get sick? What was wrong?
Oh no_comma_ I'm sorry! I hope she is feeling better_comma_ and you are too!
Yeah me too. They are unbelievable. 
Yeah it is hard to imagine how they pulled that off.
Great. I hope you have a lot of fun.
5 years is a long time.You have a lot to catch-up.
Wow_comma_ how did he get so much money if he didn't have money to pay his fees_comma_ and what were the fees for?
What a great job to get. 
It must have been an overwhelming experience_comma_ how old are the kids now?
Sweet_comma_ we all miss those memories of them growing back. Mine are adults now
Why did you feel irritated? 
Oh that sounds super annoying! Sorry for that!
That is so sad! That poor dog.
Oh it survived! What a lucky dog.
Oh_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that. The only thing that helps is time unfortunately.
After some time passes though_comma_ you'll wonder why you were so sad.
I think he should exercise more self-restraint when it comes to your relationship
That is very dangerous attitude to have. I would be very cautious as it may bring much unintended social consequences
do you act surprised ?
did you drink a lot ?
How does he go about showing it off? 
that sounds really childish of him lol 
Did you apologize_comma_ and do something nice to make up for it?
Wow!  Well_comma_ everyone makes mistakes_comma_ and if you apologized and bought her a ring_comma_ that should about cover it_comma_ lol.
You should be proud of the fact you have a new home to build a lifetime of memories in.
You all have reason to celebrate.  You should throw a huge party to thank them.
Wow! Congrats! I've heard that's very difficult to do.
Good for you. Do you feel any different health wise?
Oh yeah? What job did you apply for?
That's great! I really hope you do get it_comma_ you sound very excited.
Cool what did you get?
Nice_comma_ what brand was it?
I've only heard a little about them but they're a good brand! Did you get it yet or are you still waiting?
That sounds like fun! I love family time!
Yes it sure is! We must appreciate the things that money cant buy too!
Oh that is so scary! What happened after?
Oh no. I hope everything worked out okay!
Nice!  Did you use that extra to do anything special?
That's probably the best choice.  I was thinking you could use it to spruce up a new place a bit_comma_ which it sounds like you did :)
That sounds like a really fun and joyful surprise.  Young birthdays are amazing.
Yeah_comma_ after 21 they really are pointless.  Most of my birthdays_comma_ I enjoy a good dose of work all day_comma_ lol.
I think that would be a very wise idea.
Are you working a full time job?
I am sorry to hear that. I know that would be hard.
I hope things get better for you.
Did you try to reason with them?
You should report them to the authorities
thats so awesome....... what uni is it? 
impressive my god! you really must be so proud... 
Yeah I love that feeling_comma_ you need to cherish it!
That's good_comma_ try to figure out what caused it!
god.... did you have any extra clothes or able to change? 
sounds like a good reason to leave maybe i should spill juice on myself too lol 
Cool congrats_comma_ what did you eat?
Well a promotion is always good. Did you have a burrito?
A dog is an awesome gift for a little kid.  I bet you were super excited.
I bet!  Maybe I should get my kids a dog for Christmas_comma_ I know it would be a great choice for them.
Trimming down on the junk food? 
Oh okay I see. I understand_comma_ being healthy is important. I hope you are being sensitive to her feelings though_comma_ weight can be a touchy subject!
Your husband is just being a good daddy  hahaha you will miss the experience when the kid grows up
Then talk with him_comma_ try to reason with him
That sucks_comma_ but being lonely can sometimes help you discover new hobbies.
Yes_comma_ your happiness doesn't depend on nobody else.
That's no fair! Where you left out on purpose?
Yeah I would be upset about that too.
what orchestra was it or where was it? 
sounds very cool id love to go listen someday 
Turbulence always scares me lol. In reality the plane is very safe though.
How often do you fly? The more you do it the easier it gets.
Cool I lived in Palm Beach County for 2 years. I fly to the Philippines every few years and it takes over 12 hours!
That is so sad.  It sucks to end any relationship.
That seems like a pretty crazy reason to throw away four years.  I am sorry that happened to you.
I feel your pain. It's crazy how reckless some drivers can be. I was always taught the importance of using my signals.
Honestly in Florida I see similar behaviors among some drivers. I'm not sure if they are rushing or just don't care.
That's cool I guess...do your parents not trust you in their own house? lol
Gotcha. Well glad it worked out for ya
someone forget to pay the bill? 
that is a very good story
I bet. That's so sweet.
Were you able to record the moment?
That's unfortunate_comma_ did you end up with a ticket?
Ouch_comma_ I hope it wasn't too expensive.
I havent played video games in years I really need to buy a system but I dont even know where to begin now adays lol 
I liked it better when it said releash I figured you had a lisp. ( lol joking ) I will check into it! thanks 
Did you need the money for something specific? 
Were you able to sleep last night?
Did you get hurt?
Glad to hear that.
I always get nervous too... never know what they will find right ! Whats wrong? 
jeez thank god! ugh glad you are okay 
I can understand_comma_ the holidays are exciting_comma_ almost there though.
I hope it's worth the wait!
That is nice of you. Family is great to have when you get older.
Yes it is. I am glad you are there for your grandmother!
Oh no_comma_ that is really sad. You should research your dog's allergies so that it does not happen with other foods.
That is great! I hope your dog gets better fast.
Oh I bet that was super frustrating! How did you react?
Younger siblings tend to be that way sometimes.
Great where are you going?
I agree_comma_ it's better to overpack than underpack.
I am so sorry to hear that!  Don't worry.  I know it is hard but every day will get better.
Just be strong.  She is in a better place now.
How exciting! Why did you choose Tahiti?
The photos of Tahitian beaches I've seen are beautiful! Will you be visiting a beach?
Oh no! Was she okay_comma_ or did she cry?
That is good_comma_ I'm glad she was okay. I once got hit in the face with one_comma_ so I know it can sting.
I am sorry to hear that. Can I ask why?
I don't think you should feel ashamed at all. Parent's are there to help you until you are able to manage on your own.
and how do you feel about it? Are you ready?
Then that's good! I am glad you feel confident_comma_ that will help!
That is a great idea! I need to do that as well_comma_ seems I always forget something!
That is great! I'm happy for you!
Oh no_comma_ I hope it wasn't unwarranted!
It's definitely a difficult position to be in_comma_ I hope your coworkers were understanding.
Omg_comma_ how many months were you pregnant before this happened?
i'm so sorry to hear about this
Oh that is a tough one! You have to tell her no matter what! Just suck it up and break it to her!
I know you are scared_comma_ but this was a choice you made_comma_ now you have to deal with the consequences.
We will always have fond memories that come to our minds. I am sorry to hear that but also happy you can have the memoru. 
Yes she is! 
What was the prize you didn't win?
Oh well I'm sure there's always next year! Was it a fitness test or what
It is good you are happy with your current position. What do you do?
That is awesome! I'm happy for you!
Wow_comma_ it must be a very recent and trendy hair style
You husband must be very happy with the style
I understand a lot of people have issues with him.  What makes you embarrassed?
Well in his business dealings in the past it probably served him well to be blunt and agressive.  I can see how that would bother some people
I am sorry to hear that.Is the poilice helping you.
You should install security cameras around your house.
That is so nice. Moms are the best. You are lucky to have a good one!
I definitely will! My mom is sick _comma_ so I plan on spending all the time with her I can!
That's so good for you! Are you going to save more money now?
I can imagine! I hope you're able to save a lot and have good financial security.
Do I even wanna hear it? Okay tell me... what happened? :o
So you had chocolate covered ants! I bet thats pricey somewhere in another country! ha ha 
oh man did you forget?
well hopefully she understands too_comma_ you seem pretty guilty about it.
That's sounds like a very smart and effective safety precaution. Was it enough to adequately defend your family?
Did you end up feeling like you had stronger defenses than the hurricane had strength when it reached your area? I mean in an overprotected kind of way.
That is really sad. Many people I grew up with have passed from overdose. It's tragic.
I don't believe it is either. I'm so sorry to hear about your friend.
That is great. Did you buy anything else?
So you have relatively new computer essentials. Sounds like you are set for the next while.
That sounds cool_comma_ what did the circus consist of? Did they have elephants?
Cool! I haven't been to a circus in years. I think I should go again soon.
That's pretty cool.  It always helps to have someone helping you when you're sick.
I had a girlfriend who was really caring. Baked me a birthday cake_comma_ made me a scarf_comma_ and bought me clothes...but I messed it up and we're no long together but you live and you learn
oh man_comma_ do you miss it? How about your brother?
oh yeah that's way too cold! I'm sorry you feel a bit homesick. Remember you are away because you are bettering yourself
Ouch!  That had to feel embarrassing!  Did you apologize?
That's good.  That shows your true character.
Wow! That never happens! You must have been so excited! 
I would have bought more tickets hoping I was having good luck after that! 
That's sucks. You must have been devastated when you got the news.
You'll get over it. They're probably up in heaven watching over you now.
I am too actually. I don't care for them at all!
They're obsessed with guns_comma_ what do you expect?
Are you ok? How is your recovery?
You are lucky to have a top-notch doctor helping you.
That's great_comma_ from the sound of it_comma_ your probably thought it was going to be boring_comma_ huh?
That must have been very entertaining to watch then. I'm glad you enjoyed it so much.
Oh no_comma_ are you feeling any better now? Or are you still having problems?
Oh_comma_ well that sounds like a step in the right direction at least. I hear vocational school is great for many different kind of jobs_comma_ usually more physical.
That is very risky and volatile!  With no risk_comma_ there is no reward!  I am rooting for you!
That is a good position to be in.  There have been millionaires made in crytocurrency.
Oh wow! What's better than a raise? A raise you didn't even expect!
Is it a pretty substantial increase?
That's great. I bet she's never home now.
I know_comma_ time fly's by so fast. Congrats to her. Just tell her to be careful on the road.
I am happy to hear that! Any specific reasons?
Wow that is a huge achievement! Any parent would be proud.
That could happen to anyone.Don't feel so bad.
Keep trying and you will see improvments.
what about friend?
but what about?
That's good launch you gat tere 
ok that is cool
Oh man_comma_ that sucks. You may need to say something to her. 
Hopefully. Maybe she was having a bad day.
Wow! That must've been a surprise 
She must've really enjoyed the time. Where did you guys go out to eat? Was it nice?
Sounds cool! There isn't anything like that around here.
Wow that is a lot of money! Congrats!
If all else fails_comma_ save it!
Wow! That must have been exciting. Were you nervous?
Oh_comma_ that sucks! Did you relax a bit after take off or were you anxious the whole time?
Well_comma_ you should.You did a nasty thing.
That really does not make a lot of sense.
what about it?
really? that seems to be an amazing event
I'm not sure.  What baby is it?
Yeah_comma_ that's my baby.  It learned to roll over after about 5 months.
That's horrible! I hope it wasn't a lot of money!
That's happened to me before. I hate trying to get things like that settled.
Oh my God that's terrible!  So sad.  I'd be mad too.  What did you do?
Did the police come? I hope she got her stuff back
No kidding.  I would hate for that to happen to anyone else.
I bet.  The world can be so scary!  I'm glad she was okay
That's cool! It's nice to have someone close that is talented like that and can help with those things.
I always wish I was good at design. I've tried_comma_ but I'm pretty garbage_comma_ haha!
I used to play Madden a lot so I understand the excitement.  It is a fun game
I do enjoy football_comma_ it means that fall is right around the corner and I love the weather
Me too_comma_ god bless air conditioning
True_comma_  heat makes me angry
I used to collect too when I was a kid_comma_ I still have some but they are probably worth nothing other than nostalgia.
Oh oh I got you neat!  So stuff you used to play in as a kid.  That is nice of you_comma_ sports equipment can be expensive
Oh sure_comma_ I played football in high school and still have my letter jacket and one really messed up jersey.  I dont think I would ever get rid of them
College in general tends to be a lot of fun.  Anything in particular?
Sounds like a grand old time.
Why can't you just move away when they smoke?
That seems like a rather complicated situation than.
Have you heard how she's doing at her new job? 
Yeah_comma_ that sounds hard. :/ I'm sorry you're missing her. 
Oh that sounds ominous!
That sounds scary! I hope it all ended okay!
Oh man I hate when that happens...did you dry it off or change to a new pair?
Dang that sucks.  You should check out the brand Mizzen and Main_comma_ I heard it on a Tim Ferriss podcast once...dress shirts and pants that wick away moisture like underarmour
I can absolutely see where you're coming from! Growing up my parents were neither wealthy nor very poor_comma_ but I feel like I had a great childhood.
I live pretty minimalist. I have the things I need to enjoy life_comma_ like a home gym and a gaming computer while being able to afford living essentials. It doesn't take much for me to be happy.
How fun! That must have been scary to do that!
That is true! I bet it is taking a lot of time_comma_ you must be exhausted!
Not very good. My insurance might not cover the damages.
Someone scratched my car and slashed my tires.
That is impressive.You must have a super memory.
I know.I was just being sarcastic with you.
I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ do you have positive memories that you can remember them with at least?
Oh well it's good they're still around.
oh_comma_ sorry to hear this. you just want to make it up clean soon
you have to find the person who did this.then you should made the mess to clean it up
I agree_comma_ man. Almost nothing feels as good as financial security.
But good lovin' can be a bill.. if you know what I mean.
What do you do to get prepared?
Sounds like somebody's thinking ahead! Do you listen to a lot of Alex Jones
Maybe you could try AA meetings or suggest to your wife that she can go to Al Anon meetings. It's a good first start.
It worked for me and my husband. We were going through the same type of thing for about a year.
Talk to him wisely
Oh I mean talk to him in the way that he will understand. With love so that he reasons with you
I would be too! Have you had time to prepare?
That's good. I'm sure you will do good!
Ah_comma_ I have so many fond memories of playing ball in the yard with my dad!
That's fantastic :) Nostalgia is an amazing thing
That's amazing! I bet he was elated.
You'll have to congratulate him for me. What a great accomplishment.
You must be so happy? What was the job you got a interview for?
Is the nanny job close to where you live?
Thing very carrefully before making this important decision.
She is probably working hard to provide a better life for the family.
You must be taking good care of her in and out if you know what I mean
I hope you can make her realize how grateful you are by being faithful
Oh me neither! I don't like a cheater!
Seems simple_comma_ but nobody does it that way it seems like.
Oh yeah? What song is it?
Oh man_comma_ just saying that name brings back nostalgia for me!
That is great_comma_ but I take she is not alive anymore??
Well_comma_ she is in a better place for sure.
I would have to agree with you there. I don't trust him at all!
I agree. I can't understand how his supporters don't see it! I guess they don't WANT to see it!
You'll be fine. It will be a great learning experience.
I agree_comma_ but the journey makes it worth it. You'll meet new people and have new experiences.
That's awesome.  Do you go kayaking often?
Do you own your own kayak or do you rent?
I want to get a sea kayak (I like to fish)
Its also a lot cheaper than a boat and you can get into the shallow salt flats easy.
That's very irritating! Is it difficult to change the headlights in your truck?
Yeah that shouldn't happen. I hate changing the headlights on my car. They made it really tough to get to.
I can see the appeal. I have the opposite situation. Tiny sub-compact_comma_ but goes a long time on a tank.
Seems incredible but also kind of boring at the same time.
Was anyone else there watching him too?
What did your son do that makes you so happy?
That's great! I'm sure that you are a very proud parent!
Good for you.It looks he is making an effort.
He just proved he loves you a lot.
Why are you anxious about the counry?
I think we'll be fine.   Peopel talk a lot about a trade war but_comma_ leave out the fact that places like the EU already tax our goods at much higher rates than we tax theirs.      How can they call us raising our tariffs a trade war if they're still lower than what they bill us? 
Congrats.I bet they were very impress with you.
I bet they will never challenge you again.
Yes_comma_ It feels disgusting and you want to throw your shoe away afterwards. 
No_comma_ never barefoot. I hope you took a long shower. Smelling like dog poo wont get you any ladies.
That would be tough. Have you found a support group to go too?
That would be difficult! I can't imagine the pain you must be going through. Sounds like ya'll have good memories together.
That sounds like a great gandma! You are so blessed to have those memories with her!
My mom thinks that her grandma's spirit is in me_comma_ because she died right before I was born.
I'm sorry_comma_ interviews can be rough. Was there a part of the interview day that you found especially difficult?
Maybe it went better than you thought! If not_comma_ you still gained some experience from the day.
really?
pets are good as they keep company
oh my god_comma_ it's like a most heartbroken moment of me
because in that moment is a gift and the last end of hope
I'm not quite sure what you are telling me_comma_ but handling work and school is certainly hard
I suppose. Training the next generation is important
Whats wrong? Did anything happen? Have you reached out to any friends lately?
Aw man_comma_ Im sorry. That sounds rough. I know how you feel. Time usually helps but it's pretty gradual. Hang in there.
Can we use the "broken" to describe our political system? 
I agree_comma_ the political system we have is a mess and I think it will get worse.
Wow congratulations! Is this your first?
Wow I'm sure you'll be a great parent! Best of luck!
My boyfriend had issues with his foot_comma_ he's even had a few hospital stays for it.
His was too. He had an ulcer that got very infected. Lost half his pinky toe.
I feel you.I had the same feeling when I first left my child on day-care 
You are gonna have to let go one day.It's gonna be hard
I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ is there something in particular that's bothering you the most?
I agree that tensions are higher than ever! Hopefully our country will get on the right track soon_comma_ I'm looking forward to voting in the primaries.
Oh no!  Why are you mad at them?
That stinks!  Try not to be jealous though.  Something else will come your way.
I bet it was.It looks like you had a panic attack.
You probably need to do some kind of therapy to supres these panic attacks.
That is horrible! Have you ever said anything to him about it?
Maybe you should mention that you just want a "guy's night" and he would get the hint? 
That sucks. Well on the bright side at least you had a suit. Hopefully you were just a regular attendee. 
Yeah_comma_ I know how that is. I bet you won't forget it next time after having to endure all that.
Oh no! You should have preordered it online!
What book was it?
Oh no! You must be quite upset about that. I am sorry to hear that.
Wow_comma_ that is very unfortunate. Maybe a camera nearby was able to see them.
That is very upsetting. Everything will be okay though.
I have not seen a snake in the woods_comma_ have you? That sounds frightening!
What did you do? 
Holy smokes!
Oh I hate when that happens. I'm sorry you felt that way. Did you not buy the dress?
That's good though. I'm glad you were able to find something.
oh man.Tha must have been so embarassing.
You could not read the room?? Someone was probably laughing at you.
first way to overcome it is to figure out the reason for the fear
I think you have to go for a check up first before you can conclude. It might be a harmless mole
Oh wow! That must have been frightening! That sounds like an exciting experience_comma_ though.
No kidding! That will be a memory that you will be unlikely to forget!
That is something to be excited about.  How far away are you moving?
Sounds like a nice upgrade.  Do you think you'll miss your old house at all?
It's okay. People are very understanding. Did you underpay? I'm sure it happens all the time! 
We all have those moments! Sometimes you just have to shake it out of your mind and take a deep breath.
I did. I once won $10_comma_000 from Colgate Toothpaste.
I do use their toothpaste_comma_ but it was just an instant win contest online. It was years ago. Have you ever won a cash prize?
Wow! That's amazing!
I'm sorry to hear you were feeling that way.
What types of encouragement was your friend saying to you?
That's a cool toy you got for your nephew 
That will help him alot
yeah that's true
That's not so bad. Everyone cheats on their diet from time to time. I would just pick up where you left off.
Well that's all the more reason that you shouldn't worry about it! You deserved to have a day off after that long!
Oh how exciting_comma_ you must be proud!
Yeah_comma_ my husband got a thank you like that at work recently and it made us so happy too. Congratulations!
Did you end up taking him?
Is he just naturally unruly or does he have some sort of condition?
I'm aware of the "terrible two's"  I've never heard of the threenager but_comma_ im not surprised to hear of it
Oh man! I love Pokemon! The first one I ever played was Pokemon Blue.
Those were the good ol' days. Now they have way too many Pokemon. I miss the original 151.
That's awesome to hear! Your hard work has paid off.
You should buy yourself a nice treat once you get the promotion!
Good luck.I bet you are ready for this exam.
I am sure you are going to be a succesfull professional 
That sucks. Maybe you can find yourself a new hobby that will keep you occupied while he's gone?
That's understandable. I'd probably feel the same way in the same situation.
Oh that's awful! I invested 6_comma_000 in January and I'm down to $150 now. I sold off a lot to pay bills but if I wait for it to go back up I can maybe recover 1_comma_500. 
I know_comma_ I am confident it will go back so I'm hanging on to this last bit. Good luck!
So you guys probably don't get along very well?
Does the wife hate you?
I don't_comma_ are you waiting for one?
Nice_comma_ I hope you get a nice bonus check!
Oh that sounds like fun if you are an outdoor person. Are you excited?
Well that is good_comma_ how many people are you going with?
Congrats.I bet you worked hard for tha raised.
You deserve this raise and many more in the future.
Aw_comma_ that's nice! I haven't considered that yet as I'm still quite young
I hope so one day! It's a goal of mine :)
Wow_comma_ that is scary. Did you guys do anything or just stay away from it?
Yes_comma_ I'd be very concerned about pets_comma_ too.  I'm glad your fiance got it before it caused anyone anymore trouble.
Oh no! What happened? I can't imagine having to go through something that scary. 
Holy moly! I am so glad you are okay. I'm sure that gave you quite a fright. 
I love going to the casino! My favorite game of all time is blackjack. What are you thinking about playing?
It's swell to meet another player of the craft. Do you rake in the big bucks playing hold 'em?
Oh man... that would tick me off.  What did you do?
I probably would not chop his tree down.  You want to have the moral high ground.  But yes I would confront him
Sounds exciting! Are you going anywhere exotic?
Nice! I visited Spain not too long ago. I am positive you will have a blast.
Oh that's fun! I love to play video games_comma_ but it's usually with friends.
Anything from Mario Party to God of War. It's always fun with friends around for commentary lol
What's your orientation?
I see_comma_ there are some jerks out there in this world.
Oh my_comma_ hope u are alright now. It must have been a terrible experience
Good that you finally took control of the situation
What is the subject?? The test will be oral or in writing.
If you are prepared_comma_ then you will do fine.
Do you think they are messing up the country?
Yeah they feed off of his crazy I think.
That's awesome.  How long have you been together?
Congratulations to both her and you!  I'm sure she'll keep doing well in her new role.
That happens sometimes.  Was it mistaken for something that might have been sitting there forever?
I'm sure if you explain it to them_comma_ and maybe treat them to lunch another day_comma_ they'll forgive you_comma_ if they haven't already.
I'm kinda the same way. Although_comma_ I feel like if my friends truly care about me_comma_ they'll find out and remember my birthday on their own. No need to go blabbing to everyone about it.
Now why would they go and do that! Well_comma_ in any case_comma_ what did good ole Ron get for you?
Yay! That is a difficult feat.
Mine took months to train forever. I was so happy when he finally learned.
Have you tried taking any aspirin? I feel bad for you_comma_ my friend.
Yeah_comma_ sometimes you have to do that to get better. I would take another dose if I were you.
Do you have any plans for it? That sounds exciting!
I would kill for two weeks of R&R_comma_ good for you!
That's wonderful. There's nothing like a bit of retail therapy to cheer you up. Now you
Sure does. I hope you continue to enjoy your new dress - you make me want to go and buy one now!
Oh_comma_ I will and I know just where I'll wear it - there's a new restaurant just opened I want to try out.
Oh no! I am sorry to hear that. Is she feeling any better?
That must have been unpleasant for her. I am glad to hear that she is feeling better_comma_
I know the anciptation of giving big presentations.  Are you nervous?
I would tell you to think of everyone in their underwear_comma_ but I am pretty sure that advice never works!
Holy moly_comma_ that's some rough luck. Did you find the guy who did it?
Dang dude. Is your insurance company covering it at least?
I am so glad to hear that. What is the secret?
How did you meet her? Was it through an online dating service?
Get to studying! I'm sure if you get in a few mores hours you will feel more confident! 
Hard work always pays off!
I have been there_comma_ my friend. But_comma_ the good news is_comma_ if you aren't typically late for your bills_comma_ the utilities companies will often cut you a break.
I am positive! I have been late before for the very same reason. Don't even need to make phone calls - they just give you a small late fee and that's it. I wouldn't go making it a habit_comma_ though.
How did that happen? I would be so upset.
Did Starbucks not make you a new one? I am definitely grumpy if I don't get my morning coffee! 
Oh well it's still fun that you got to participate in that.
Haha that's really a cute story though.
Oh wow_comma_ did anything end up happening to you? Did you get 20 years in prison?
Eh_comma_ I suppose worse things could happen. Was it worth it?
Great! what kind of business?
Music therapy sounds very interesting.
That is great. Do you remember what words he had to spell?
That is a pretty tough word. I am happy your son did so great. You must have been beaming.
That's a downer_comma_ man. Who do you think was the perpetrator?
That really sucks man. Did he ever apologize to you and give the money back?
Oh no! Did he not study?
He will for sure get it next time. I'm sure you scared him enough haha
I love flying!  Was it your first time on an airplane?
I prefer night flying as well.  I love how you can see the city lights moving_comma_ like it's the lifeblood of a living thing.
Sometimes destiny has strange ways of manifesting itself.
Try to conquer your wife again_comma_ it's never too late for a second chance_comma_ the love of our lives makes it worth the effort.
I do as well! What do you miss most?
There's really nothing like college parties. Those were the days.
You should confiscate his video game and teach him a lesson.
You are doing the right thing for him to learn discipline.
Oh no! Any particular reason why?
That's horrible! But_comma_ it could be many other things instead. I hope you go to the doctor
How did it go.Did you have fun?
Why is that? You don't now how to dance?
Oh no. How did you pay?
That is good. Hopefully he can pay you back.
Oh no_comma_ that must've been awful! 
Woah_comma_ that sounds like a very unpleasant experience. I hope it's never gonna happen to you again.
That's a bummer. What happened once you moved there?
It's good to hear that your experience was fulfilling. I hope I can have a similar once someday.
That would be tough! Have you tried switching to cash envelopes?
Where you just use cash and put money in an envelope_comma_ when it's gone_comma_ it's gone_comma_ nothing left to spend.
and what happened? 
Yeah_comma_ I always get a little anxious when you get pulled in for those meetings.    Is it going to be champagne or chewing
it sucks when you can't depend on co-workers
well i hope some better people get hired
Oh wow_comma_ I have done that before as well. You may have to deal with some indigestion.
Oh boy_comma_ you have need to invest in some Depends.
Oh no_comma_ you must have been quite upset. What did you do?
That's great. I was worried that you had to go hungry.
Maybe it was a thunderstorm forming??
It souds like a storm forming.I have experience with thunderstorms.
Really? What did your boss do that made you so mad?
Oh that is a real bummer. Your boss should appreciate you for giving good ideas.
That is great news!  What does he play?
Is there a big baseball following in Alaska?
Those were the days_comma_ my friend. What kind of car did you have?
Ford makes some pretty nifty cars! I have a Ford Focus myself. Not much_comma_ but it has killer gas mileage.
OMG_comma_ i don't think i could eat that many burgers in a week if I tried. What was bothering you so much that it lead to you eating so many burgers?
Im sorry you felt that way_comma_ I hope you start feeling better. Maybe go for a walk and get some fresh air.
That's sad_comma_ I wonder why the dog can't find a home!
Maybe the poor dog doesn't get along with other dogs.
Oh no_comma_ I am so sorry to hear that. That must be so hard. How have you been coping?
Oh wow_comma_ that is so sad. Have you contacted an attorney?
What haha that's a real thing???
Wow that's cool well good job winning!
Oh geez_comma_ that sounds pretty embarrassing. Did any of the bottles break?
That's a shame. If they did_comma_ you could've reversed the situation and summoned everybody over to throw down and have a supremo wine fest.
You should feel bad for just cursing at a lady.
Did you at least apologized?
That must be a great feeling!  Good for you!  You should be proud that things are going well and not take it for granted.
Good deal!  I am happy to help!
Yes_comma_ I am as well. Do you have any investments that could be affected?
I understand that_comma_ but do you have a personal investment portfolio that will be directly affected?
Oh wow_comma_ do they taste good?
Are they expensive or did you just find them in the wild?
Sure_comma_ go ahead. Is it an important one?
That's great. Have yo sent it yet? Congratulations_comma_ by the way. Wish you good luck !
OK sure. Go ahead
Oh wow! that sounds like fun. What was your favorite part of the visit?
I love Thai food_comma_ what a treat! I am glad that you had such a wonderful time.
Aww_comma_ did you find a lot?
I love finding old videos too!
Yeah it sure is. Especially when you are streaming or talking to someone in the moment.
Completely frustrating. I usually end up calling customer service and complaining until it's fixed if it happens repeatedly. 
did your daughter's team win?
Lol_comma_ that must have been a very proud moment for you as a parent
Oh no that is terrible. Are you guys still talking now?
Well that is not good. What did she do that was so bad?
I would be scared too_comma_ but I'm happy it turned out well.
That is the best feeling.
Oh no_comma_ that is too bad. I am sorry for your unneeded expenditures.
That is a good attitude to have. I am proud of your maturity.
Yeah_comma_ kids get crazy when they are bored.  Get them to read a book!
You might need to lay down the law and ground them!
How kind of him! I bet that is going to help you out a lot!
Dads are the best_comma_ what would we do without them?
Wow how amazing! You must be so excited. 
Wow enjoy it_comma_ you deserve it!
Omg_comma_ you should have killed it
I think you should fumigate your home
Have you been able to get over your fear?
That is good to hear. You might consider joining some groups. Toastmasters might be a good one to look into.
Was your aunt nice to you?
Sometimes it is difficult to talk to relatives. Take a deep breath and treat her like a long time friend.  
Oh no_comma_ I hate when that happens.  People always feel a need to look and it causes the other lanes to be at a standstill as well.  How long did you have to wait?
Adding time to your commute from work to home is the worst.  I mean you've put in a full day_comma_ you just want to get home!
So_comma_ the pup is healthy and  situated now?
I'm sorry to hear that RIP doggo.   I have a rescue that's middle aged now. 
How exciting! Has it been a long time since you've seen her?
I'm jealous! That's so sweet and I hope you have a great time!
Oh no! What did you do?
how about a hobble down the isle? I'm sure it will still be just as beautiful walking down the isle or not. 
That would be difficult_comma_ so glad you survived.
Hopefully you have a strong family support.
maybe it was best to avoid drama at work
not getting your coworker in trouble and causing a conflict
Has your boyfriend ever cheated on you?
I agree. Trust is the basis for any good relationship.
How did that go?
The cigarette break is not a good sign at all.
This is so good_comma_ well done
How long have you been on this?
I think there are a lot more choices now than there was years ago
I still remember the old tube tvs
That is nice. Where are you going?
That is a good idea.
I am sure he will!
No_comma_ no reason to he will do it.
That's awesome.  Good parenting pays off.
always a plus.  That makes things easier
Nice_comma_ how excited are you for it?
I'd be that excited too_comma_ I love to fish.
You are a hard working person_comma_ you will be fine
Like they say_comma_ hard-work never killed anyone
Oh my god that's crazy_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that.
I hope nothing like that ever happens again.
What type of review are you looking for?
Oh that would be nerve wracking! Good Luck!
I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ I've felt similar before.
Did they every tell you why they left without you?
I'm so sorry to hear that. I lost my cat recently too. 
That's a great name. :) My cat's name was Midnight. I had him it seemed forever. How long did you have yours
oh wow really? You shouldn't be! You should be excited
did they go okay? Are you anxious about tomorrow then?
I'm sorry to hear that. I've lost both of mine_comma_ I know how you feel.
The downward spiral is neveer pleasent to see.
Oh wow! I never got a car for mine! Did you take good care of it?
Oh no! A lot of kids that age seem to do that with cars they get_comma_ yet parents keep buying them new.
Oh no_comma_ why is that?
What instruments do your daughters play?
Hi friend_comma_ how are you?
Not yet_comma_ I think you should talk to me about it.
To feel joy is the maximum_comma_ whatever the cause_comma_ I think it is a beautiful emotion.
Feel joy and feel peace_comma_ are the best combination of emotions to be happy in life.
Good for you. what makes you so happy?
Good point. Any example to share?
Oh wow_comma_ I am so sorry to hear that. May I ask what happened?
Oh_comma_ well I'm sure she was worried_comma_ but disowning you doesn't help! And now she won't know your child. That's very sad. 
I'm sure it was hard but worth it!
That's great I hope you get it!
I bet that was an awkward conversation. Did you feel embarassed?
Well that is good she prepared you_comma_ most parents just avoid the topic.
I've heard it's quite dangerous_comma_ are you scared?
I bet it's going to be hard to fit in culturally_comma_ are you religious?
Yea somethings are just worth trying to see how they'd go. You made it through welldone
Yes teachers do alot and they deserve credit
Wow that's so fun_comma_ you're lucky to have many people who care about you.
I hope you had fun.
That is so thoughtful!
I can only imagine with the stress of a new baby.
What kind of jacket did they steal from you?
Sorry to hear that_comma_ did you eventually get it back or no?
you shouldn't' have been playing in the kitchen
You should
That's great. It's been a hot summer. I hope you have fun.
Everybody likes beach trips.
Finding things to be grateful for have saved my sanity
What is your favorite part about each day?
Oh I don't know. Probably happy hour.
that is her maternal instinct
no i dont think it is
Oh no that is terrible. What did you take?
Oh boy_comma_ were you just trying to borrow it? I bet he was real disappointed.
Wow the zoo sounds like an amazing time. Lol the diaper thing happens.
Whew good thing for those back up diapers. Glad you guys had fun.
Wow_comma_ that sounds amazing. I would have died and gone to heaven if I had gotten one.
I cried_comma_ jumped_comma_ and screamed... when I got my first student loan bill! Congrats on the good work though!
what subject is it in?
i hope you perform well on your exam
Well_comma_ he could bring something home. Don't feel bad.
Don't feel too guilty. You can have that for dinner tomorrow night. Get pizza tonight.
Oh my gosh_comma_ how horrible! I hope she will be okay.
You are a nice friend_comma_ she's lucky to have you.
Dang. That is annoying
You must have informed them abou this
I bet that was really cool! Did you play with them for a little? You're never to old to play with toys
Thats awesome! Old toys are the best toys
That's great. How long have you been apart for?
Do you have some fun activities planned?
oh wow! I've always wanted to do that. You're quite brave
It's good to have someone with you who knows what they're doing_comma_ though. That certainly helps!
That is awesome! Why were you nervous?
I am so happy everything went well for you.
Wow.  That is a sight to wake up to.  What did you do?
I can imagine.  I would be burning that sheet set
Oh my god! Did it try to bite you?
That must have been a shock. I hope you took it outside after that.
What kind of task was it?
and well how did it go after all your research?
Fantastic.  Congratulations!
I bet you're so happy! I would be! 
who doesn't :) what are you planning to do?
Omg I am so sorry to hear that. :( Are you feeling at peace at all now? 
That is a long time so I am sure its been very hard. Im really sorry but I hope soon you can find peace. 
That's terrible and frustrating because you can't really do anything about it.
HAHA_comma_ best to find another job first. At least employment is looking pretty good these days.
Oh man_comma_ that sounds awful. I thought the 7 hour drives we did with 3 of us were awful.
That's rough. I feel for you! But_comma_ as you said it's over so life goes on :}
That's pretty amazing. I have tried juggling 3 small objects before and felt like it was impossible. 
I can understand that. After my failed attempt_comma_ my oldest son_comma_ then 13_comma_ came in the room juggling successfully a few minutes later. He watched a youtube video and learned in about 15 minutes...
I'm sorry to hear that.  What do they get treatment for?
I'm sure that's really tough.  I hope he appreciates all that you're doing for him_comma_ and I'm sure it'll work out :)
That's nice_comma_ must have saved you a lot of time.
It's election day here_comma_ that may be the cause of it.
I wish I got that many days off.  The good old days of childhood.
Wait until summer comes_comma_ you'll be ready for them to go back to school after a month.
oh i love perfume_comma_ whats it smell like? 
Oh for sure and its honestly insane to spend too much on a perfume! Call me cheap lol 
Great attitude! Yes whatever you put your mind too and work hard at_comma_ will happen!
You're so welcome! Good luck and I hope it's a great place with a good paycheck!
It's always good to see family! What concert was it?
Oh cool! What kind of music does he play?
I am so happy for you and the dog
I am sure she will be okay
Have you asked the teacher for any sort of help?
I think you should try to find different ways to go about the problem. I'm not great at math either but I think you could find some online forums willing to help you.
Are spending too much on unnecessary things?
Do you have any concrete financial plan on full repayment of your debts?
Congrats to your father! At what age did he get to finally relax!?
Good for him! He sounds like an awesome guy. 
That is nice. Are you excited
It should be a easy process
Oh great! Is it a college and what are you studying?
Oh man! I bet you are! Just remember to be confident in yourself and you'll do fine! Don't let trolls to you either
Oh I know how that feels. You can start over tomorrow though.
I hate those cravings. I need to start doing better too.
That's awesome! I love swimming. Are you going to the pool or the beach?
I love going to the pool. I hope you have a great time!
OH no. I really dislike theives.
Do you have insurance?
You should think about that for all of your stuff got situations like this.
Leaving you? why?
OK now I understand
we are too hard on ourselves! we really shouldnt care what others think but i would have felt the same 
im the same! give people a look when they look at you maybe some crazy eyes! lol 
Oh geez! That would suck! I hope it wasn't a cold day? Could you drive home and get new clothes?
Oh I have numbness in my hands so I am always spilling things so don't feel too bad! I understand though. As you can see- I don't like having stuff on my clothes either lol
Wow! How old is he?
Amazing! Congratulations. When so many children have issues_comma_ it is always great to see one that is healthy and well.
That sounds awful. Mine used to have a bad group of friends too at one point so I know how it feels. Sometimes you just want to yell "grow up!!!"
Yes!!! I cannot even express to you how much I agree!! My mom used to say "you are who you hang out with" and its one of the most true things I have ever been told by anyone!! 
That's awful. It sounds like a freak accident. What happend?
Wow_comma_ I am sorry to hear. I had a friend with an aneurysm pass suddenly about 2 years ago. It was hard and I can't imagine how you feel with it being your father. 
Why were you nervous
I do love a good sour
I can imagine she and the school appreciate that
That was a very nice gesture
How did it go?
We all get nervous about changing our surroundings
I have seen them
I am not sure I believe them most of the time though
Wow. That's pretty cool.
I would have been too. No one has ever bought me a car.
I am sorry_comma_ how old was it
That is a lot of memories
What was your excuse?
Wow_comma_ that is pretty bad.  At least it was a cousin and not a sibling.
Sounds like he's getting the hang of it_comma_ that's good.
Maybe I should of did the same for mines_comma_ to late now.
Thank you_comma_ I'll do that.
yes I do. Do you?
Is that a good or a bad thing?
Sticky paper is so gross. have you every used cloves? You can put the in your windows to keep flies out.
I don'r know. Once I found out about cloves that worked fr me. Maybe you should het an exterminator although that seems extreme.
Probablt. Im sorry I couldnt help you. 
Okay_comma_ How come?
That sounds great! I should look in too them more.
Thats pretty awesome! College or highschool testt?
Nice! Science is fun but for some reason the tests can be very hard!
I am sure no one noticed
I do get that way too sometimes
So you did get it?
Well good for you. Is it everything you wanted> I once had a job turn out to be the worst.
I do not yet
I bet that was scary at the time
New people make me so nervous.
I have never tried one of those. Did it help?
Well that's pretty cool. You should own the joint by now.
Oh yeah? I bet that was exciting for both of you. Open house at their school?
I had an experience similar to that as well. Their teachers look like they should still be in High School. But_comma_ they are so eager to do well I get excited with my kids for the school year.
Definatly. I would not want to do that job_comma_ with such alful pay unless I loved the work. Wouldn't be fair to anyone involved.
I love going to the thrift stores as well! What did you by
tell me about it!! I bought so many brand new shirts in a thrift store last year and they still look awesome because the quality was so great
having a few good friends or even one is better then having a bunch of fake ones. It is hard to make friends as an adult that are true friends even if you are great at it! So don't feel bad
I understand! I used to be the social butterfly but now after a lot of trauma I am very anxious as well and I don't care to have people I don't trust around me anyhow. Maybe try meetups or forums where people have the same interests?
What does he do that scares you?
He may just be on a different time schedule than you. My neighbor does something similar_comma_ he mows his lawn at 3am
That's kind of odd. Is he old?
Wow. That must be nice.
Good for you! I have never gotten a promotion before.
Most of them are like that_comma_ or they are fixated by what everything costs.
Yes_comma_ but isn't innocence a beautiful thing.
Me too. I hope you have nice memories.
Well thats good. Some people aren't so lucky
Oh no! What did you do?
that's not good :( i hope you don't drive under influence anymore_comma_ you could've gotten into an accident
Oh_comma_ that sound alful! Some people have zero respect for others belonging and even less for things we all need to share.
It is sad. Espically since if the same people acted like they cared and wanted to they could help make the enviroment better for everyone. 
Oh! I LOVE the sound of rain_comma_ I could just sit in the warm rain too! 
It does just bring about a great feeling doesn't it?
Oh thank goodness! If I may ask_comma_ what was he in the hospital for?
Was it anything serious? So many things can go wrong with out bodies!
I hate when people do that
I am not sure_comma_ that is a good question
What did they want?
Well_comma_ it was fortunate that you got it back ok.
Did something bad happen?
That is true. It is sad.
I've heard of that_comma_ is it any good?
I've found a lot of BBC shows are really good because they don't try to drag them out really far.
Wow that is crazy_comma_ sometimes not so uncommon depending on your area_comma_ sadly! 
Yes it is very disgusting_comma_ I just don't understand why it takes some people so long to get their act together!
Death can happen in an INSTANT! I have been there the past year. I am sorry!
Me too! So sorry! Life doesn't get any easier. It's just about trying to enjoy every day
Its always worth a shot
My mom was bipolar
What did he do?
Well that happens sometimes.
I do hate storms_comma_ they can be scary
I am glad you are okay though
That is exciting! So it will be the first real year of school for you and them? 
I forgot all about prek_comma_ you can see mine arent old enough yet. lol Well I am happy for you thats very exciting. 
Oh_comma_ that is exciting. What did you do with them?
That's a great idea. Such a good way to preserve a memory.
Wow thats amazing! How old are they and what do they play?
Oh! Two of the most beautiful instruments! Congrats! Does musical ability run in your family?
Awesome! What do you hope for their future?
What do you think that you'll have ?
I'm glad you seem to have it all figured out.
Oh geez. That is common with kids. Not the funnest times. Do you carry extra clothes too?
Oh yes! Always carry an extra onesie and pants. That has saved me many times!
How old is your gramma ? old people can get grumpy
i hope it all works out for your mom 
What happened to it
That doesnt sound so hard to fix
What was his excuse?
Ouch that's pretty bad.  Did he apologize?
That's very vague_comma_ did you like the shows? Or the program itself?
That's so cool! I liked the shows on that channel as well.
Doesn't that cost a lot?
They do always have snacks.
Oh! Do you feel scared at all and will miss her?
Do they have cameras there so you can watch her during the day?
I will look into that thank you so much thats kind of you! Any special diet or fitness online you are following? I know you can do this. 
I recently read about fasting myself! I tried it for a whole few days and of course stopped. I wish I had your determination! I wish you a lot of luck. :) 
I have a few friends doing keto and you seem to really like it so I am going to give it a go! Ill try your advice. thank you! 
Aw poor kitty! Well that is their fault for sure. Have you spoke to them about it? Also you can get these spray things that keep cast out of your yard- They spray them with water when they cross a barrier-
Oh man! Well some owners suck! I would definitely look in to the water sprayers. Is the cat fixed? 
You should make it a weekend project
you will get it done i believe in you
That is so beautiful! Are you going to do it every year now and make it tradition? 
Right! Thats what I am thinking too... so cool when communities come together like that. 
Wow_comma_ haven't people heard of knocking once and waiting? That sounds worrisome.
Was he a salesman?
so you got a lemon ? check your state laws
Things like this happen all the time
Oh man! I so understand that! Did you have to eat ramen and $1 meals? I did! It was awful! I am so glad you are in a better place now
Oh yes_comma_ I have been there to! Some food pantries are amazing but some have just crappy sugary foods. 
What did he do? 
Oh neighborhood_comma_ lol I thought it said neighbor for a second! Why wasnt it safe? 
Typos happen to the best of us right! Im glad the summer was atleast nice for them and that the bad people left! 
I'll be the judge of that
That's nothing. As long as you still get her a phone. I wouldnt be mad
Well give her the new phone and then you get one later. Happy wife happy life
Oh I hear you! It'
Sorry! It's so nice when you can afford nice stuff! I feel you there. I do not have a TV- I watch everything on the computer lol! As I am on it all the time
how long was it out for
i hear you 
That's very kind of you.  Did she feel better after?
That's good to hear.  Do parents often view the daycare cameras?
Oh man! I am so sorry! You must be devastated.
Oh man..I just had someone go through that. It is horrifying. Yes a long battle can be good or bad. I am sorry.
I bet that was a nice surprise
That is always a nice surprise
What does the teacher say happened?
Oh_comma_ that's rough. 
Sometimes depending on who they are.
That's so nice. Im happy for you.
Are you gonna see each other again soon?
a hurricane ?
we have a hurricane kit / emergency essential kit always . 
they are good to have . always to be prepared .
a good phone is something everyone must have 
you're the first person i know that has an xperia
I feel the same! I hate apple products. I refuse to use them
I didn't know that. Another reason to not like them
I am sure you will do great. What kind of biology is it?
You just need to know that the mitochondria is the powerhouse.
Yeah I could never do bio it was too much memorization. I like physics more which is why I'm in engineering.
what type of math is it?
Oh my god! That is so sad! I am so sorry!
That is a good way of looking at things.
Some people are just so careless... I am sure your mom was keeping a good eye on the child. shame on the parent tho. 
I know its a pain in the rear to lug them around but you have to. I lug mine around like a kangaroo with her kid in her pouch. 
That's the worst.. expectations can make and break us. I hope the next time around you get it! 
that is a good outlook to have
That is a great. I hope it was a good offer
Oh that sounds convenient
That is so true. 
I am thankful for every day I get to spend with my children. 
That makes me sad too. I wish there was more I could do to help out.
That's a good idea!
It feels good when your on top of things.
Well_comma_ I'm sure they will benefit greatly from all the preparation. They should be proud to have a mom who cares as much as you.
Oh thats wonderful! how long have your parents been together?
Oh geez_comma_ lol. Do you not like to cook? Congratulate your parents for me. It's great to find someone you love and then also to have it last so long!
I've seen that before. It is sad.
I do too. Everyone deserves to have someone in their corner.
Oh that's a bummer! Do you go to college locally?
Oh great! I am not a big fan of college anyway. Maybe you will find a new love while they are away :)
I don't think anything is worse than dealing with a period as a teenager!
I miss being so carefree and having the whole world at my fingertips!
Awesome! History is HARD! I always had a hard time remembering the dates and times especially.
Amazing! What was your final grade?
Its nice that you care so much about them
They are that
That's unfortunate. How many animals did you have?
What kind of animals were they?
ugh.. for the better or worst? How are you feeling? 
If you are feeling that way then it probably is! On to a fresh start. 
Me either. It is going to be interesting.
Two daughters and one son
Hope you've got a lot of storage room. We try to do that too.
how old are they ?
Wow_comma_ mothers have the best instincts when it comes to their children.
Exactly_comma_ take care of her. She is a treasure.
You're very lucky! A lot of people can't say that these days.
I wish I could do that.
That is so sad!  I would be so mad at the drunk driver!  How could he live with himself!
I agree!  There is no excuse for that to have happened!  Such a tragedy!
Why did they do that?
Oh shoot. Did you forget to pay?
I am sure that was embarrassing. Just a mistake. 
That's pretty cool. Did they win any games in the tournament?
Well that's amazing!
Who did they win it over?
That is awesome!
Did you pass?
That is great_comma_ good job.
That is disappointing. What will you do now?
I don't blame you.
THat is great.  SHe will have fun participating in spelling bees
That is outstanding!
what scared you
oh man how did you get it out
That's wonderful. I feel the same about my daughters.
10 and 13 now_comma_ but it never changes.
That sucks. I hope you had insurance.
Well he was the one that caused it_comma_ so that's what he gets.
What happened?
I'm sorry_comma_ you must miss them a lot if you don't see them as much as you used to.
He is a jerk.
Don't forgive him or your friend. Find new people 
Why have you wanted every career instead of focusing on just one?
I think you could still find one if you wanted too.
That sucks.  Have you investigated her
Sucks_comma_ I've had to work under scumbag managment before
Thats awesome! What have you been doing to reach it? 
ugh sounds like work...... but you did it! 
I'm 50 and haven't rode one since I was 2.
Don't have anywhere I need to go.
I can relate to that. 
That will be nice.  Having a side gig really helps a lot as long as it doesnt take too much time
Nice!  What was it for?
Awesome!  What do you do at your job?
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm sure you will be vindicated.
whoops_comma_ lots of people have done that. what'd she say?
hopefully you were able to work it out...if not...in the future don't tell girlfriends about exes.
And did you?
Great job!
That does sound awful!  The thought of being out in the middle of the ocean makes me nervous 
I agree.  Don't let it stop  from taking a nice getaway though
That sounds really annoying!  You should confront him and request he stop.
That would make me really angry.  Call a tow truck to teach him a lesson.
Why didnt you want to notify or leave some sort of little note on the car? 
happens sometimes just dont know what to do in those moments. 
That seems like it'd be strange.
well_comma_ you could always have left.
Do they play any instruments?
That's cool_comma_ can they sing too?
I hate when that happens_comma_ did you have to put all your stuff back?
Well it happens to everyone at least once probably_comma_ so no worries.
happens all the time in the city i live in_comma_ people are rude! 
yup! no reason to stoop to their level. you did right 
I hope you didn't use any.
Was the soup good at least?
What did you say?
What did you do instead?
That would freak me out.  What was it form?
Oh Wow!  Did he get caught?
What were you on edge about?
What movie did she see?
Sorry to hear that. What's wrong?
I know that feeling_comma_ it will get better. Just gotta stay positive
Ha_comma_ that sounds comical.
You could just think that maybe you were alone.
That was pretty crappy. What did you do instead.
that's really crappy.    You're racking up the bad karma.
That's got to be frustrating for you.
Have you tried asking for a raise yourself?
I have felt that way sometimes too
I am trying to teach that to my children. They are stubborn
What are you going to do about it? 
Get some hot shots raid spray it shoots like 20 to 30 feet in the air! I sprayed all the way from the ground to the top of my roof. Spray and run. lol! 
It is great to appreciate the things that we often take for granted
That is true. It makes some of our trivial problems seem so insignificant
That's never good. What was it?
At least it wasn't a stranger trying to break in!
Oh jeez!! Noooo... I hate them. They are evil and so mean. They literally come right at you for no reason. 
I cant handle any type of insect. I had a giant black one fly into my apartment today when I opened the door so I feel you. 
Haha_comma_ is she going with you?
Definitely take her with you! She will love it as much as you
What was the award?
Dang_comma_ that sucks. Did you get 2nd place?
I like to tan in the sun.
Yes_comma_ I always use sun screen.
No idea_comma_ what was it?
I love having a clean home and warm food! No better feeling. Did your husband do this for u?
Never heard of it but you better believe i will be googling. 
deff jumping on the internet now to read into it i do like spiderman! 
Oh no_comma_ what did you do ?
how long did you have to stay that way.
What prompted that?
I can understand that.  Reflecting on different times
Me too. We just need to keep at it and not give up.
I'm not even looking for anything serious like marriage_comma_ just a friend that I can relate to romantically.
I used to have the DVD but I sold all of the to upgrade to Bluray. I havent seen that in forever
The ;ast spiderman movie was really good. Did you see it?
What's going on on Friday? 
Oh awesome! I love taking vacations. Where are you going? 
What! You still got your discount tho right? So you get to use them over again!? 
thats righty! you better go buy a lotto ticket because you are deff lucky 
That sucks_comma_ I love my mom so much I can't imagine her being dead...
I will def do that_comma_ I need to be more grateful for while she is alive. Thank you for that
That's what family is for!
Why do you hate your parents?
great_comma_ I hope it works out for you.
what's your preferred field?
Yes_comma_ kids are a blessing.
Enjoy it because they grow up so fast.
That is so cool!  How old is your dog?
That is exciting!
Wow_comma_ she is talented. Is programming difficult/?
Oh_comma_ I thought you meant like computer programming. You must be so proud
Driving in the city is challenging_comma_ I hope she does ok!
There's also a lot of one ways in the city too. She's going to get used to it_comma_ it should be fine
I hear it is harder the second time around to get into shape but you sound motivated! 
Really? Thats good to know because I had no idea. I wish you a lot of luck in regaining your muscles back! 
I know that feeling but I crashed my car my dad bought for me like 1 year later. But that feeling of happiness was awesome!
A bad and good experience haha. Drive safely unlike me
Sounds like an amazing day honestly... i hope tomorrow goes the same for you. 
Oh yeah and I hate to admit it but if it doesnt go as planned I do let it ruin my day. 
What did you get started doing?
Oh no!  I would be too
how old is he?
I hope he was okay.
You have to do what you have to do. Did anyone walk out and see you? lol 
atleast they didnt see you! 
wow i am impressed
what are your long term goals /
It's always a pain waiting to hear back from a bank.  I always think something's gonna go wrong.
I'm sure everything will work out fine :)
Is that to become a bartender?
Are you nervous?
Was it good?
Did you return the movie?
Wow_comma_ they don't sound like good friends to me. 
You should give them the cold shoulder next time you see them. That's what I would do.
Nice! I bet you feel like a weight was lifted off your shoulders!
What is your side gig if you don't mind me asking?
There is a lot of buzz for that is there?
THat sounds cool.  What format do you play that on?
I don't watch a lot of baseball but was it an important game?
Well_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe they will reschedule it for a later date?
I do not have a car either.
I will never buy a car again.
i know that feeling_comma_ congraz
your first home ?
Sounds like it was worth the ticket_comma_ what kind of caR? 
deff worth it! 
I bet you're relieved!  Good friends are like that though_comma_ especially if they know you're struggling. 
Maybe when you pay him back_comma_ you can get him a little something extra to show your appreciation.
Oh no haha_comma_ were you prepared for it?
Nice_comma_ good job!
Waiting always kills me! How much longer do you have to wait? 
I am sending you good vibes and luck! 
What happened?!?
Oh no_comma_ that's never good. Is he doing fine now/
its a part of life you know
i remeber that day
that is outstanding!
Right.  Hopefully that will motivate her to keep up the good work!
Just tell her? She will be grateful for the honesty.
Dang_comma_ that's rough. I wouldn't know what to do either. It's like you choose to be a good friend and destroy their marriage or let her get married so she's happy. Goodl uck
Did you jump out or did you brave the war and kill it!?
Im sure!!! I had a gecko come in my house today and it was adorable yet i was still super scared to touch it. 
I feel the same way. I have social anxiety so standing in front of a crowd is pretty terrifying. 
Oh man! Just stay confident! You have to keep the negative thoughts in the back of your mind.
Yikes_comma_ I hope you have insurance.
Don't worry man_comma_ you'll be fine. Everyone makes mistakes
Thats good everything is so close. It really helps out a lot and walking is good for you! 
You and I both! 
Resist the temptation!
Food is the worst too because all that junk food is all around us.
I love those moments where you get to see all the hard work get payed off! How did she do?
I bet you are so proud of her!
Oh no!  I bet you regretted that fast!
That sounds bad. It was probably harder to get off too
How long are we talking about ?
Sounds like you know what to do.
What's wrong?
It should be getting better now that summer is over. Good luck
It's hard to admit when we are wrong. DO you think you will fess up?
I understand that
I believe in you! Where are you planning on going?
I was thinking a cruise sounds perfect for you and your kids!
Have you called her back since then?
I'm sorry_comma_ sometimes people_comma_ even family can be difficult. you can't be all things to all people. give yourself a break on this.
You guys sound like a strong family!
Sorry to hear that_comma_ maybe one day you entire family can get along
I feel the same way.  I don't trust people are paying attention
That is my biggest fear too
What happened?
I hope it was a mistake?
That was crazy!  I agree
Soccer is a fun sport to play. It would be good for you to do something you love also
Was it their fault?
Been there_comma_ done that lol.
What type of dog is she?
Haven't heard of that one before.
What happened?
Whoa_comma_ that sucks. You need to get away from them asap.
I've only been to a couple of minor leagure games in the city.
That's pretty cool.
I have never had any. Is it similar to eating crawfish?
Sometimes you just have to indulge and then do better next time.
I am with you right now! However tracking carbs accurately in an app has been a gamechanger this week
You will be so shocked at how well it works I promise.  You don't want to go over. 
That's awesome! How old is your cousins?
I hope you guys have a lot of fun! I think I'm going to meet my cousin in New Jersey on the 9th? It's so nice seeing famiy members after a long time.
Oh no. Did you get it back?
That's such a shame. It really makes you lose your trust in people.
I did the sae thing this year I took my daughter to see my favorite band. Who was the singer?
We saw Incubus. She had a good time.
Maybe she was tired or something. Don't make her feel bad_comma_ just encourage her!
I know that feeling. It's part of being human though and I hope you guys worked it out!
I bet you will! You seem prepared. 
Good luck! 
WHat are you anticipating for next year?
That is awesome to hear.  So relieving isn't it
"was" pretty sure ?
I'm sorry to hear that.
It's such a terrible situation. You just never know what circumstances have brought someone to where they are.
I know what you mean. 
That suck's_comma_ have you tried calling the bank to let them know about the mistake?
Did you get your money back?
What do you do in the summer?
I love going to concerts.
Who isn't? I am scared of death because I don't know what will happen afterwards. I fear the unknown.
Me too.
I am also_comma_ I love football.
I only watch football on Sundays.
Prom sounds exciting.  Do you have a date?
Nice! That sounds so fun.  Are you taking her to dinner first?
Music can do that to you sometimes. I listen to mine regularly.
I would agree with that 100%
I know right. If you invade my personal space_comma_ prepare for backlash.
I hate that so much_comma_ people need to learn manners.
Oh my gosh!  I would be mortified!  Did your face turn red?
Wow!  That had to be so embarrassing!  I would probably quit my job!
What all do you have stored so far?
Do you also have a go-bag?
Yes_comma_ I do not like that either.
Never_comma_ I am a nice guy.
Me too_comma_ it throws my frequency off. 
I think noise reduction headphones would be perfect for you_comma_ try Bose or something.
What kind of work did you do?
I guess you got a lot accomplished then. Do you work a regular job too?
Bummer. I enjoyed summer so much.
But at least Christmas is around the corner. I love Christmas just as much as the summer!
You can do it
I'm working on my debt too.
That would be a great time.  What did you do?
I bet.  I would be too
I bet you were. That is a great accomplishment! 
Are you you guys going to celebrate?
Like years. I use emails a lot but I don't feel the need to use actual paper letters. It's 2018!
I know right. That kind of stuff is very nostalgic
It seems like an almost unachievable goal_comma_ especially at my age.
50_comma_ yeah_comma_ but It's just not the same.
That sounds fun.  What kind?
Those are really cool looking
That must have been nerve-wracking?
Sounds like you have a very responsible young lady growing up.
Me too_comma_ I feel you bro. It's ok at least make sure you are being productive.
Try joining clubs or finding hobbies? Or you can always make friends on online video games!
Sounds gross lol
Omg. You should take your dog to an obedience school.
Those are always so much fun. Catching up with old friends.
Thats great. I have one coming up. I hope it turns out as good as your went.
That is disappointing.  Is there other things you can apply for?
Any other promotions where you are currently
Congrats! You must be excited to start your career.
I'm glad you stayed the course. There are a lot of big opportunities in store for you.
What is that?
Oh right.  I havnt heard of it.  Are you playing?
Oh no what happened? Everything ok?
Maybe you can bring it to the tire place. Maybe they can patch it real quick.
Oh no I hate that feeling.  Is it better now?
That is no good
Wow great_comma_  are you happy with your purchase?
Congratulation! i hope you enjoy it.
Was it a good deal?
Excellent that it was a great value 
That's cool_comma_ what was the interview about?
Local or national?\
are you making good money though ?
well in that case way to go
That is great.  Well done!
I know that for sure.  I am working that myself.
I hope you guys enjoy your visit! Are you guys really close?
Aww_comma_ I bet you miss her a lot. Well it's good you get to see her soon!
You must have felt nostalgic of the old days.
I understand it is usually hard moving to a new city leaving some many people and placed behind
What position was that?
Oh wow_comma_ I bet you were ready for that. Were you already working there?
That is great! I bet it feels good.
It sure is and it gives you something to be proud of.
Great_comma_ when will you start?
Fantastic_comma_ keep your spirits up and the sky's the limit.
That’s great! I bet he is ecstatic!
That is definitely something to you to be proud of!
That sounds great!  How old is he?
Nice_comma_ Did you do any fun activities together?
have you thought about investing
hopefully you will see great returns this year
I hope everything goes well friend.
Don't worry once they administer the anesthesia you shouldn't feel a thing.
thats awful_comma_ did it clean up easily?
well that's good to hear
That's great! I hope you enjoyed the food..
Keep it that way. If too many people find out it might ruin the experience.
Nice_comma_ softball is fun. I used to play baseball but always had fun playing softball in gym class
Yeah it's rewarding teaching kids and helping them learn how to become functioning human beings. I have a 2 year old nephew who's nuts and asks questions all the time
That’s interesting. What did you have to do?
That sounds cool!
That's amazing. I have only been on a few planes in my life.
I have not and will not ever.
Uh oh_comma_ did you apologize to the person after they answered or did you just hang up?
Oh wow! That's even worse than dialing a stranger. At least he didn't pick up!
That is something I need too.  How did they get new so cheap?
That sounds awesome
It is very important to stay close to family.
That is wonderful to hear.  When times are tough_comma_ family is all you have in this world.
You don't get any free time?
OH. I know what you mean.
Did you like them okay?
I'm sure she'll have a fun year.
I do too.  I have a fantastic recipe
That is really nice!
OH that sucks.
Do you think the other person deserved it at all.
Awesome!  What will you be doing?
That is awesome. They chose you for a reason. You will do great!
That's sad.
That's really bad. What is she going to do about it>
Have you eaten it all yet ?
Well_comma_ you've done well so far then .
What happened?
I would have peed my pants.
I am sure you are good at many other things though. 
That’s ok.  If you would like to learn start simple
I'm sorry for your loss. That sa to hear.
It must be really tough. It will get better.
Oh yea? What was the bet?
Everyone's got that low minimum wage job at one point in their life sometimes.
Take a power nap.
They really do recharger you.
That’s no good. How did she do that?
That explains it!
Did everything go okay?
Your friend probably understands if you couldnt make it.
lol c'mon man_comma_ show some class.
I understand_comma_ sometimes you just gotta "let a bomb drop".
Did it escape your house?
Have you put out signs? contacted the animal shelter?
Smores are a must when camping.
I don't know. They probably brought their cell phones
i have never been so lucky.
I've found a couple of dollars and lighters in the washing machine. Thats about it lol
Allergic to onions? I have never heard of anyone with that allergy. Must be tough 
I hate onions_comma_ I just don't like the texture of them
I would love to do that. Did it cost him much?
Well he sure did save a lot in labor costs.
Hoping the beta was okay.
Oh wow. A fish freezing in the sun? Or was it winter and sunny?
Did it?
Like beige and brown?
That would be nice_comma_ but it's highly unlikely.
It sure was.
That sounds familiar.  Is there someone she can get it from?
That’s a relief.  
What did you yell at her for?
Oh_comma_ that is sad_comma_ I hope she knows mistakes happen!
Mario is such a classic. Haven't played smash since gamecube I think.
Which character is your favorite?
Why don't ou call her?
Well send it to her with a note to say you miss her. She can call you if she has time.
Oh. Who did you vote for?
Wow. What does she do that peole would vote for her every year?
I have never tried and never will lol
That's what I think. Plus I'd miss bacon too much.
You must be his role model! That's awesome.
That's just funny! Well I'm glad to hear she's learning and improving! Good to start them young.
What's inside?
Why did she send you a shipment anyways? 
Appreciate them while they are with you and try not to worry.
It's unfortunately. If only we can all go together and not leave anyone behind.
Well you seem to have done a great job parenting!
That is awesome_comma_ that is hard to come by
Do you guys still spend the holidays together?
Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh no! Is what you have in there worth more than 500?
I know but if there is nothing valuable in there just forget about it.
I hate bullying. You should talk to the kiids parents.
Beat the kids up. That's what I would do.
For college?
There's still another month of summer left where I am.
I feel the same way. Everyone isn't as fortunate to have family.
I learned a long time ago how important family is and now I have my own.
Exactly
What show is that?
I did not know it was ending_comma_ sorry to hear that!
What are your goals?
Ah I see. It's always nice to have a goal to work towards.
Are you keeping them?
That's a lot to take in.
Oh. How was it different to the previous ones?
Yea. Didn't warrant a new version_comma_ hu?
I am sorry to hear that_comma_ why are you working extra?
Ah_comma_ I know that all too well_comma_ best of luck
Where are you headed?
Me neither_comma_ sounds like fun!
That's an incredible achievement. He must've worked really hard.
sometimes it's the one who keep it on the downlow who are the smartest.
how did you like it?
I'm not a big fan of spinach myself.
Wow. I have been trying. How did you do it?
That's great. I'll get there one day. I wanna see my great grandkids
I didn't know they were recreating that game! When does it come out?
I'll need to keep a look out for it!
That is terrible_comma_ I hope you feel better!
Yeah_comma_ I hope so!
What dog breed is it?
Oh wow_comma_ that is an energetic dog_comma_ good luck!
It sucks_comma_ but sometimes you just can't compare yourself to other people.
Yea_comma_ I get you. It's hard not to feel bad when someone seems to have it easier.
That's tough_comma_ it's good he has a friend like you to help him out though.
It's good you have a close friend to count on too if needed.
That's good to have reliable friends.
How many years now?
I think a lot of us have been afraid of the dark.
I'm glad you're not afraid of it anymore though!
Where are you going?
Ah_comma_ that should be fun_comma_ probably nice this time of year!
Why aren't you anymore? 
What were you most afraid of at night?
That is amazing! I'm happy to hear that. I can relate_comma_ I feel like I have undiagnosed ADD.
I have a very hard time focusing on what I'm reading_comma_ so it can definitely slow down the learning process.
I can relate to that! It's so mortifying because everyone begins to look at you like you're a bad parent!
That's usually the main culprit of those situations!
I'd probably stay loyal too_comma_ after weighing the pros and cons_comma_ making a list for myself.
good for you_comma_ wish i could say the same for myself. I'm not unhappy_comma_ just got more work to do.
Wow. Sounds like crazy stuff I wouldn't want to get involved in.
Sounds like you're a lot more mature about it.
I have not played it. Are you going to go back to the last and quit playing it?
Yes_comma_ I agree. I'd give it a week.
Thats good. I hate that your having difficulties. 
Yeah its tough. But_comma_ we just got to keep working.
Im so sorry. I know the feeling_comma_ Im really sorry!
Yes_comma_ I grew up with him and he got me through my parents splitting up and everything. (cause I didnt have many friends). I know everyone always says dont get another one too soon but for both my cats that passed and my dog_comma_ doing that really is what got me out of the rut. 
Oh man. At least_comma_ you've got some other assignments to bring that back up.
I'm surprised school started alraedy.
is it a major or minor surgery?
i hope everything goes well !
Families are really precious.
Yea. So many people take their loved ones for granted.
That is very sweet of them!
It sounds like it_comma_ people can be so sweet
That's really sweet_comma_ I think most people feel the same way as you. Families are really important.
I don't know what I would do without mine!
When is she getting married?
Oh wow_comma_ are you one of the bridesmaids?
So many people cheat nowadays. That's good to hear!
It is_comma_ but we can learn from them and not do the same thing.
That is not good_comma_ how much will it cost?
Oh wow_comma_ I could not afford that at all
I am sorry_comma_ why did you break up?
That is not fun_comma_ sorry to hear that...

Portability? Ah_comma_ so it can play all the older games?
It can help_comma_ but I could not watch it...
Me neither_comma_ which sucks cause it pays well
That's good to hear. I think family is very important.
I wouldn't be the person I am today without my family.
Our family are the first people in our life.
How many people are in your family?
Is it still in good shape?
Do you live far away from him now?
That's great. How long have you two been tegether?
Wow. That's a long time. Congrats!
That is a big burden_comma_ hope he is holding up okay
That is great to hear
Thats really good. Trust is important in a relationship.
That's the truth.

What type of dog is it?
I have never heard of that_comma_ I have a MaltiPoo
How many people are in your family?
Small family.
Thats sad. But_comma_ sometimes people need others to help take care of them.
Its good that he's there for her.
How did you do that?
That will do it_comma_ sorry to hear that!
Did that make you feel embarassed?
How old were you when you overcame it?
Why are you so tired?
What is your job?
People come into our lives for a reason sometimes.
I'm glad they were for positive reasons for you.
I'm not much for eating out_comma_ I heard Chipotle is good though.
Well I'm glad some people can enjoy it at least.
Oh nice. What instrument did they play?
That's pretty amazing!
How did that happen?
That is very sweet of them_comma_ do not take them for granted!
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yep. You just said that.
Do you have a guess?
I do too_comma_ that would not be good
That's awesome. How did you guys meet?
Oh man. Seems like if you didn't meet your sweetheart in school_comma_ it's more difficult to find a girlfriend.
That's exciting_comma_ what are you doing there?
Watch out for any spooky politicians haha.
Oh man_comma_ must make you feel bad.
It's better not to compare your situation to others sometimes.
That is a lot of food_comma_ hope you can eat all
That makes sense_comma_ hope you enjoy it!
she's a lucky girl.
Not a lot of guys say nice things about their girlfriends behind their back_comma_ haha!
That's nice to hear. How did you guys meet?
You guys still in college?
That is a lot_comma_ I hope he does!
I believe you_comma_ that would be hard to get around_comma_ a lot of money
Wow_comma_ have you tried calling it?
That is not good_comma_ where could you have left it?
They must have really been there for you.
haha most of the time.
That's a lot of money_comma_ how did it go?
That seems unlucky. Was it your first time in the stock market?
Oh wow. So who was the fairy?
She's an awesome lady. You're one lucky person.
were they expensive shoes?
What shoes were they?
When did you meet them?
Nice. How long have you all been together?
Why is that?
Ah_comma_ well did you like the other person?
Why were you afraid?
I see. I think I used to be afraid because I cuoldn't see anything.
How was that? Must have been a throwback!
I am sorry to hear that_comma_ hope you get some more?
Super Smash Bros is a classic!
How many people do you usually play with?
What is it called?
Oh_comma_ why did it go out of business?
I hope you get the job!
Interviews can be nerve wrecking.
Good_comma_ how big is your family?
How about your immediate family?
Was the nightlight in your room?
You're okay with it now?
i like alone time
i think its good to find a healthy balance between being alone and being social
That is super unfortunate_comma_ did you manage to save any of the fries by chance? 
I'm glad that you did not lose all of them_comma_ it would be terrible if you did all that work for nothing!
Why not? You only live once get out. Make the most out of every day!
Sorry to hear that. How did you meet your lady friend?
i bet that was fun_comma_ were you nervous?
it was probably really exciting though too
A little bump in a relationship should not affect it_comma_ that is good. Always love and take care of her.
A key to a long relationship is persistence_comma_ so keep at it! 
Oh no!  Was he OK?  I hope there was no permanent damage!
That had to be really scary for you.  I bet you will never make that mistake again!
Wow I could never do that_comma_ I really hate heights.
You're pretty brave for conquering that fear.
That is bad. What happened?
Wow. Did you call the police?
Yeah it sucks. I have noticed it too.
I know and it is really sad.
You really got lucky that day.
Be sure to play the lottery.It looks like you are on fire.
I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anyone around in your life?
That's horrible! I hope you're trying to do some fun things to take your mind off the pain.
How happy you must be!
will he go to college?
Aww how nice of him! I bet you were happy
How long had it been since you had seen him?
Oh I hate when I see that happen.
Sometimes I think parents need a training class.
That sounds troubling. How did your visit go?
Well that sounds like it worked out fairly well fortunatley.
Oh I hope you do get the job! What is it?
Well good luck_comma_ that sounds like a challenging role!
What are you going to do there?
Are you going with anyone?
Oh wow that's horrible. Was the kid ok?
Haha. You already gave him a whole cake. Did he need more dessert?
Sounds exciting! What's it about?
Sounds like a really heartwarming story. Hope you have fun!
Do you like her too?
Give it a go. You might be soulmates.
Were the lines long?
I agree. More people should get involved to make a change.
I'm sorry to hear that.
You will find the right one someday.
Oh_comma_ how come?
No one's perfect. Maybe you'll see her next time.
I am so sorry to hear that.
It must be devastating for her. Do you think she'll be able to overcome the loss?
Your friend must be superman! (or woman) Lol
Yes he does. He deserves it_comma_ I hope he is going to the college that he wants to go to_comma_ all that hard work should pay off for him!
That's always disappointing. What were you wanting to buy?
That's too bad.
That's pretty cool. What are you going to do?
Oh wow_comma_ bungee jumping is a huge step!
Wow_comma_ I"m surprised. Didn't know they were that generous.
Oh ok. I was thinking it was New York where the cabbies are notorious for being rude.
That's awesome_comma_ you must have done something right to make a kid so bright.
That's the way to do it_comma_ clearly.
It could be something good maybe.
I can only imagine how frustrating that is_comma_ that's why I work at home full time.
I'm glad you got through it.
How's life now?
How old is he? Is he excited? 
You will grow to love it. Football is amazing sport. Your son will love it. 
Just wait a few years. If he sticks with it he will be at practice 6 months a year then playing games in the snow.
Oh wow. How do you feel about that?
People get lucky sometimes. It's better not to compare yourself to someone else.
Are you anxious about it?
Sometimes people are not thoughtful of other people's time.
Yay! Congratulations! Have you been saving for awhile?
That's so exciting! Best of luck with your new computer!
Oh god. I hate that. What did you do?
I'm sorry that happened. How much did it cost to repair?
Pajamas are comfortable. No shame in that.
For wearing pajamas?
Oh wow! You must've been hungry.
Will you be able to eat all that? 
Some organizations are really life savers.
Not like mine then. So many fronting to donate_comma_ but they're actually stealing.
I'm sorry to hear that but he is lucky to have you.
Yes you are_comma_ I'm sorry to hear about you losing them.
Sorry to hear that_comma_ the trouble of going to the doctor just to "confirm" its strep throat is the worst. It's like I know I have it_comma_ just help me!
Hopefully you can avoid that_comma_ the swab to the back of your throat is a gross feeling!
Oh no! maybe she needs a break for a wahile
That's no good. I guess you'll have to find a nicer game.
Oh_comma_ that's curious... By different_comma_ what do you mean? Did you buy different stuff_comma_ or go to a different store_comma_ or what?
Oh yeah_comma_ totally. And then you don't end up buying too much or too little_comma_ and you don't waste time trying to remember things. There's also tons of little apps on your phone you can get that can make it really streamlined and convenient.
I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe give it one more try_comma_ and if you continue to like it_comma_ that might be your sign to stick with it. Good luck!
Oh my gosh_comma_ that's so annoying! How did you deal with it?
That was a good solution! Smart thinking!
Well that's good_comma_ are you enjoying the new stove?
Wow how kind.
It is always a bummer when you borrow something and it breaks right away. You feel responsible and have to replace it. 
Did you end up buying him a new one?
Were they related?
That's terrible to be yelling at a kid who probably doesn't know any better.
I hope she is okay also.
You should go with her next time so that doesn't happen.
I hope he's okay. I hate when my dog is sick.
What is the dog's name? I'll say a puppy prayer for him
Must make you feel jealous.
Maybe they don't even have enough for the cars themselves.
That is weird.  Do you know what happened?
That is creepy.  
Wow that would be a really awesome thing to discover! Did you use it for something fun?
That is fun for everyone. Especially if you've been having hot sunny weather.
You guys sound really happy together.
That's wonderful. How long have you been together?
Wow that sounds so scary!
You must be pretty strong to do that.
Well that's awfully generous of them. 
Wow are they a very close friend?
That's awful. I'm so sorry you had to experience that.
Guess she's estranged for a reason.
Nice. When was the last you have seen them?
Why you didn't contact them?
Will you explain it to them?
That's understandable. Hopefully_comma_ you won't make the same mistake next time.
Yikes. Did she have to walk?
Look at the bright side. She got some exercise. We all need more exercise.
I'm so sorry to hear that. What did you guys find?
You two must miss a lot.
Good for you. I loved spending time with my grandma!
She is the sweetest woman I have ever met
That sounds crazy!
What happened next?
Nice. Did you pre-order?
Sounds like it's gonna be a lot of fun.
I know where this is going lol
You obviously weren't alone
That should be fun.  Does he live pretty far away?
That has to be tough
Oh no. Did you need it?
Sometimes we forget stuff. It happens.
What happened? 
You could have still eaten it if you were daring.
Bright side_comma_ it would have been a great excuse to order pizza. 
A complete stranger? How the heck did that happen? I'm sure you must be confident that it's safe_comma_ if they're staying with you.
So_comma_ are they trying to apply for jobs and stuff? How long do you think you'll let them stay for?
I think we're just another number for them.
I'm actually doing one now. Need better pay. I wish us both the best of luck.
Oh no! Which author is it? That really stinks when you can't finish a story. An eternal cliff-hanger.
That's a good idea. I know everyone is worried about that when it comes to George RR Martin and game of thrones.
Wow. He didn't get you one_comma_ hu? Thanks Dad.
That's nice of you. I hope he feels better soon.
It's great that your kids are having such a great relationship with their grandparents.
Yea_comma_ they do_comma_ but they're getting old. Makes me scared.
That is a long time.  What are you going to do?
That is  good.  Might be a good time to work on you
That's insanely gross.
He will be single forever.
Tragic lol
That is a great thought! What makes you so sure?
I completely know the feeling. My kids are teenagers and I threaten them every day that I will move in with them when I am old and grey lol.
If only that actually worked_comma_ right? lol
Ugh that would freak me out! Did you ever find out if it was a real bat?
Oh well that's lucky for you haha my three sons hate bugs!
Why is it so shocking?
Well she is married right? some people say sister in law before its official
That sounds really good.  What kind do you like?
That sounds great
Oh. What's happening tomorrow?
I hope you're able to tough it out.
That is amazing_comma_ did it lower your insurance rates too?
That is a bummer_comma_ but congratulations on the highest score_comma_ that is something to be proud of. 
Oh no! That sounds awful. Were you able to stop on the way home?
Oh goodness! I am so sorry that happened to you! 
That sounds wonderful. 
Does he have a sister? lol
Holy cow_comma_ that's impressive. I bet they had to be carried back home. Did they even break a sweat?
Haha_comma_ that's so funny. I bet it was even funnier to watch. I can kind of understand it--pho is really popular. I've had it and it's not bad. My girlfriend loves it and has it like once a week_comma_ along with spring rolls.
Oh god_comma_ I've been through that. At least_comma_ a bike is easy to clean?
Oh man. Sorry that happened.
Make that wish when you blow out the candles
Birthday wishes come true. You will have to work at it still though.
aw how old are they now?
You definitely need to teach them not to do that.
What time is it there?
Well they should prbabl shut it down soon. It is only Thursday.
Oh no_comma_ how come?
Well_comma_ he sounds like he really loves you.
He's definitely going to learn a lot. How long will he be away for?
Will you miss him?
Did he take good care of your car?
That's great! Not too many 16 year olds are that responsible.
That's awesome. Did you get nervous prior? 
It gets easier as you get older. I'm sure you did great.
That's sad. If you can't trust your family how can you trust. Are you going to say something?
I don't know. If you let it go it could happen again and again.
Those were the days. I remember buying 25 cents popsicles.
yep. Those popsicles are like 1-3 dollars now
What is it?  am curious.
Oh yes_comma_ and remember Bagel Bites!
Stop making me miss my childhood!
Wide open? Or just unlocked? That's crazy! I guess you got lucky you didn't get robbed or have some animals become new roommates. Hard to believe decades ago people loved to go to bed with their doors unlocked.
Uh oh! That's scary. I bet you won't let that happen again. Well_comma_ I'm glad everything ended up okay.
That is really a shame.  Too bad they won't get help for the kids
You would think they would be motivated to keep their kids
That is so disappointing. Will you stay there?
That's too bad. Maybe explore some other options and see how you feel.
That's really nice! What does he usually get at the store?
Sounds a lot like me. I love going through the toys and gadgets section to see if I can find anything for my kids.
I love a good surprise party.
I never get gifts or a party. I need new friends and family
That really stinks. What game did she used to play?
Yup. Because as soon as you give him a sweet stack of cash_comma_ he's probably going to blow it at the slots. 
Haha_comma_ why?
I disagree with both Democrats and Republicans.
I am having a similar issue.  You shouldn’t have to pay for a service they aren’t providing. 
That just isn’t right!
Shopping is fun!  What do you plan on getting?
Hopefully you will catch those great deals!  Sounds exciting!
That;s awesome. high school?
I bet you are so proud. I cried when my daughter graduated 6th grade lol
In terms of grades or something else?
Oh I see now. Wow that is pretty lucky!
That's awesome that you devoted time to care for him!  How is he doing?
That's great you got him up to a healthy weight!  Kudos on you!  I'm sure those spots will even out eventually.
Oh that's cool_comma_ having a nice new car always feel so sleek and cool.
That's good!
Ah! That's always such a scary thing_comma_ because there's such a dreaded anticipation that goes along with it_comma_ a whole_comma_ "Will it? Won't it?" kind of game of seeing whether it will head in your direction. I live in the southeast_comma_ so I've dealt with worrying about plenty of them.
Yeah_comma_ there's always that fury of activity by everyone to go stock up on gas_comma_ groceries_comma_ and other materials like batteries_comma_ etc. So_comma_ did it ultimately end up hitting you_comma_ or no?
I really hope he gets accepted!
You sound like an amazing father.  He is so lucky!
I've never watched it but i've heard it's really good. Maybe I should give it a try
Really? I will definitely give it a try. My favorite tv show is stranger things
I know the feeling.
Three dollars?
Nice! What do you plan to do with a house empty of kids?
I am glad for you. Sometimes kids can be annoying.
Stressful. Was your work understanding? Is he ok?
Is he feeling better?
Like the creamsicles?
You wouldn't believe. I'm eating one right now.
Me too. They wer 50 cent on the ice cream truck.
That's cool. I buy the box of six and don't share with anyone
Why would you think that?
Why would you think they are jerks?
You must have lived there for a long time.
WOW
I am so sorry to hear that.  It will get better.
That seems pretty gross_comma_ especially the possums.
Nice and congrats! How long have you been together?
That's really nice. Been thinking about proposing to my girlfriend as well. We've been together for almost the same amount of time.
I'm sorry who is going in too 8th grade?
Oh awesome! Oh my gosh they do. I can't believe mine are in their 20's now! I hate it when they grow up honestly
Holy cow that's amazing!  Good on you!  How much weight have you lost?
Yeah I can relate.  I bet you feel and look amazing!  That determination is a quality to behold.  Keep working hard!
Where were you?
Did you forget your lines?
Oh that's terrible. 
I always hide my sweet whenever I buy any
Hmmm sounds like an unpleasant job. Maybe they ask you for help because you're the only one around? It doesn't hurt to help those in need.
That is a fair point. You can't have those that are there to protect us be distracted. This is a key tenant when I'm on watch in the Navy.
oh man_comma_ i'm glad you didn't get into an accident though. please be careful next time. did he give you a ticket?
At least he didn't take your driver's license and tow your car
They did!  That is so terrible!
I'm sorry_comma_ maybe they will get back together.
That is cool_comma_ did you film it?
That is awesome_comma_ is this your first kid.
That's typically a nerve wracking experience. Did you meet any kind people?
Yeah_comma_ if it is a bad neighborhood I suppose.
PHysics? I'm glad I never took that class.
Are you looking for a career that involves physics?
What is your degree in?
Wow_comma_ impressive. What do you want to do?
Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.
Well that's one nice thing to enjoy. That's sweet.
I bet you did great!
But that is still okay. Either way you accomplished something difficult!
That's the best part of the day
The first sip of a beer is pretty nice too lol
Have you met them yet?
That might be a bad sign
Why?
Can't you see the driver on the app?
Did you get a refund?
Just eat a sandwich.
How old is she?
Wow that's odd. At least you will save some money.
What is her style?
Lol have fun
Wow that will surely be a rewarding career. I am impressed that you want to help others.
Yeah I felt bad luckily he forgave me though.
I'm sorry to hear that. We're all human_comma_ and that does happen sometimes. I guess all you can do is do your best to not say or do anything you can't take back. Is everything resolved now?
Ah_comma_ an argument with your spouse? Those are always tricky. I hope you guys can work through it amicably_comma_ because that's obviously an important relationship.
Wow. How old is she now?
how old is the valentine
Thats sweet though
Why did you ask for onions then?
Oh I was confused.
Well did you get your money back?
Im sorry to hear that.
It will get better. I know that is a tough thing.
Oh yeah? What kind of car?
Hey at least it is still a car_comma_ don't feel bad.
Oh I know what you mean! Its so weird because for that first month or so you like dont even fit in..
I hope you eventually made friends! I know how much it stinks to feel left out of everything
I do hate flooding as well
Thank goodness nothing flooded then
What happened?
You can lose weight too.
Have you tried?
Did you love it? That was sweet
Maybe she should take some art courses.
Maybe not lol
That's no good. Are you going to report him to the police?
Yeah_comma_ mentally ill people shouldn't even be allowed to have dogs. There should be a screening process.
Oh my lord! How are you still alive?
Be careful! You can puncture your stomach like that and not make it. It happens to those with bulemia all the time. Stay safe!
How do you think you did once you took the test?
I am sure you knocked that test out of the park - sweat or not.
Awesome!  Happy Birthday.  What are you going to do?
That sounds like a great plan!
I'm sorry. I bet you you miss her. That is so hard.
That sounds like a really good idea to do. 
That's a good thing.
That's really good. What class is it?
5?
Psychology made me sleepy lol
Did you move to the country?
Well you have to be safe
Then you definitely have to be dafe
Of course lol
Some people are less fortunate
Well you should cherish them and let them know how you feel.
oh no_comma_ what did you do
wow you are a brave soul
They might win the east
They should be pretty good
Congrats for your brother! When is the wedding?
Fall is a wonderful time to have it. Are you going to be the best man?
Staying in is good sometimes
Netflix is always nice
Well that's nice. What are you going to do?
That's pretty cool. I don't see my friends much since I moved.
That is commendable.  I try to
I absolutely agree
Oh yeah! So was I. That was so awesome! 
Woo hoo! That would be so awesome! 
what ended up happening
oh thats cool
It's important to me too_comma_ since I work in customer service. 
I know. The customer is always right! Or so they teach us.
I hope you get the job. Just don't be nervous . It shoes.
Good luck. 
I feel you_comma_ that feeling is the worse.
It's like that feeling when you hit a bump on the road but 100x worse!
I do too. What is your ultimate dream car?
Porches are pretty nice. Not nice as Ford sedans_comma_ though.
Sounds pretty neat! Where are you going to hike?
That's good to hear. Just don't forget that bug spray!
I hate overeating especially when I'm on a diet. I feel so guilty about it all the time.
24 burritos_comma_ my god. You are a eating terminator!
Are you going to eat them?
Hillbillies love that stuff! They love roadkill hahaha
Dang_comma_ that is some nasty stuff. Did you take your shoe and shove it in the face of your sworn enemies?
I guess you shouldn't clean the poop off your shoe then. Save it for when the time comes.
Congrats! How old is your son?
What was his first word?
Dang_comma_ those are some long hours_comma_ my friend. Do you work in a Nike sweatshop? I hear they have some primo health benefits.
I love money too. Are you planning on spending it on anything once you get those fat stacks?
Work is always so boring for me.
Work is always miserable for me.
why is that
dont let her control you!
Yes that is awesome!  I bet it makes for good times!
Are the children having fun with each other?
oh wow.  Haha  Did you talk to them and make it right?
That is great of you
That sucks_comma_ I hope you win next time!
Just don't get too addicted and turn into a degenerate gambler!
I hear ya.. practice makes perfect tho!
good luck with that_comma_ i hope it works out!
Congratulations
How long you been together?
Me too. What kind of tv shows?
Yeah_comma_ seems like all tv shows are like that. My favorite is the Teletubbies.
tell me about it! It's good that you appreciate these things
It's hard not to! We get used to all the nice things we have
I know that feeling! Eating is so addicting...
Me too_comma_ you are not alone. It's a very common problem
how long have you been there?
thats what matters
You really think so? 
I do too honestly
I couldn't. I would love to be able to walk to work_comma_ but it's just too far.
If we had a better public transportation system where I live_comma_ I'd probably choose that over cars.
oh thats awesome_comma_
thats usually when it happens
I only watch when guys are around. 
And beer.. There has to be beer.
Dogs are loyal like that.
I did when I was a kid. Her name was Terror. she was nice though
Hey that makes for peaceful living doesn't it?
Wow.   WHY?  LOL.  That's crazy
haha.  Murder documentaries are my favorite too.
That is a great place to be.  Sometimes less is more.  
That is an awesome outlook on life.  It is important to be content with what you have.
You sound like a very faithful and loyal person!
Those are some great qualities to have_comma_ that's for sure.
I like not having plans too. I enjoy just relaxing sometimes.
I had plans today_comma_ but they got canceled. I wasn't too upset haha
My dad has diabetes too but he was born with it. I heard veggies help a lot.
Sounds like a very stressful time for you. I hope everything turns out well and wish you the best of luck
That's one of those things that never gets old to complain about_comma_ because it's one of life's time-tested annoyances. And what's worse is you open the door or window for them_comma_ and they still refuse to leave...
And you never have a fly-swatter when you need one. Like_comma_ who keeps one of those around? Although I always have flip-flops because I live near the coast_comma_ so that makes a decent fly-swatter.
That is hilarious
OH no. Im sorry I laughed then.
All of it! Dang.. I bet someone wasn't happy about that. Unless you live alone_comma_ in which case_comma_ no big deal. Did you just feel like eating it_comma_ or were you feeling sad about something?
Ah_comma_ the kids. Well_comma_ maybe that's a good excuse for them to skip the sugar for a few days. I'm sure you'll make it up to them anyhow.
Nice_comma_ what type of car?
Nice_comma_ it all starts with determination first. I believe in you man!
that sucks
Tell her its okay
That sucks! Why not?
Dang. It's so hot_comma_ swimming seems to be the only way to beat the heat.
Me too. I do it all the time
Im like that with food too
What's wrong with them?
That is so gross_comma_ tell them to clean up after themselves?
That really sucks man. Why don't you get a new job?
Oh wow. What kind of job did you pick up?
that;s terrible
I think the chat is messing up. I saw something about someone being in the hospital sorry. First words are awesome
So is mine! What makes yours awesome?
Haha that is awesome.
I do not like those movies because of that
I guess try and forget about it
Why was she not there?
I guess that's understandable then. I doubt it was personal.
Well_comma_ I guess that might have been a nice surprise?
That's great! Did you catch up or go do fun things together_comma_ perhaps both?
I can undersatnd that.  Big plans or just relax?
sounds great
band camp? you know what happens at band camp.

They wont win anything
They have 4 other stars
Let's hope so.
Well that's good. I wouldnt trust my neighbor with my ice cube tray
Not even friends or faimly?
Do you not like your room mate?
oh yea did he run away?
oh thats good
Why is that? Do you like him or do you like the Cavs?
Okay then now I understand  why you are happy.
That is a great thing! What do they do?
You are so lucky. Treasure them! Forgive easily :)
oh no that is not cool
I commend you for admitting your fault in it
What did he do if you don't mind me asking?
Was it his first offense?
Its okay_comma_ you can learn from it
You will feel better tomorrow
That sounds great!  You must have felt amazing!  Was it your birthday?
Congratulations!  What a wonderful surprise!
I bet you felt guilty about it afterwards. Just let them know you needed it really bad at the moment and maybe return it?
Yes! You will feel so much better afterwards
That's not fair
That's not their choice though.
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that
That's not good. Why is she refusing?
That always makes me feel nostalgic too.  What kind of music is it?
Cool.  What kind of memories does it remind you of back in the day?
It was nice seeing them dead right? Just kidding_comma_ I know you meant other people at the funeral haha
What is a pallbearer??
That's awesome! What kind?
Oh. I am very sorry to hear that. Did your parents buy it for him?
that actually sounds pretty amazing.
I hope one day to have great seats like that.
Its okay_comma_ you can learn from it
Dont be so hard on yourseld
What movie was it?
are you living alone in general or do you get anxious when you are alone?
aww_comma_ sorry to hear that. Dont worry_comma_ everything will be fine soon.
That is too bad. Are they getting along now.
Are they okay now?
The sounds like it might be bad... What was the mistake? Maybe you're overthinking it!
Oh_comma_ that? That's big deal. Everyone has done that at least once. You're definitely overthinking it. People make mistakes. What kind of candy bar was it?
I often dream of ending my own life because of being alone.
I often times wish I didn't have any family and friends_comma_ would make things easier.
Stay positive and hopeful! What's wrong ?
I know that feeling of getting used. I hope we both find solice
Do you think you did good?
Well that escalated quickyl
I am sorry to hear that. Do you know the reason why?
Perhaps talking to your doctor would be a good idea?
That sounds like so much fun? How old is she?
Awe! They are so cute at that age. I have a granddaughter that is 6 month old.
I experience that too.  It is frustrating
That is good to hear
You do just need to accept it
Be glad of who you are as well
That's cool. How long has it been?
Wow_comma_ that's a long time ago
Aww that's awful.  How did you handle it?
Yikes.  Sorry you had to go through that.  How did your best friend take it?
I used to live right by the beach. You just described my daily life.
I definitely miss it! And you are totally right. It is worth that drive.
Aww I miss my kids being little and having snuggle parties!
I am glad he is feeling better!
that sounds exciting.  Did a lot of people show?
Awesome.  I bet that was fun
I'm sorry! I can relate to that to some level_comma_ as I often feel leery of other's intentions as well. Any reason why?
Yes_comma_ it will take some time and being with a person that is worth your trust_comma_ but it can happen. Best of luck!
Its nice to appreciate things like that
Its always nice to be grateful in life
Wow_comma_ she is so selfish
Try to convince her to change her mind!!
LOL I'm not a fan of NBA that much but I do know I don't like Golden State
Until I tell you I'm a UK fan? LOL
oh im sorry to here that. always good to see family
hopefully things get better for you
That's so nice of her! What flavor was it?
Is that your favorite kind of cake?
That is so disgusting! What did you do?
That must have been a terrible situation.
How old was she?
Wow_comma_ that's pretty young for an elder. She is in a better place now
That is very random but very cool
I bet it was fun to see that
I am too.  I don't go out much so maybe you should make sure you do that
Make a point to do it even if you don't think you want to.  you will never regret it
It's hard to do it when your mind is playing tricks with you
I just hate rejection and it's so awful. Like why do I even try
oh im sorry to hear that. what happened?
oh that stinks...
I'm sorry.  I hope you didn't get your hopes up too much.  The odds of winning are really low!
Very true.  Somebody has to win!
Who hasn't cheated on a test at school? You'll be fine_comma_ don't feel so guilty.
Why do I not believe you haha
I am sure you look fine! You can get built if you want to!
You can do it! I have faith in you!
Diets always such honestly.
I say just let it go and eat what you want bro. it's just weight.
That sucks_comma_ I hope you find someone else
I feel you_comma_ it's hard to trust people again
Oh yes_comma_ kids can be a lot! apartments should always have kids on the bottom.
I don't know why some people have kids!
That was so nice of him! That's not common to hear about young people
The world needs more people willing to help others.
What happened?
Ah_comma_ gotcha. I hope it works out for him and you
yes_comma_ who do you like?
thats cool
What is your meeting about?
Oh wow! How nerve wrecking!
Are you?  What do you do?
I hear that!
I can feel your pain.
That is very good of you to stay faithful.
I'm sorry to hear that. I am sure you will get one soon.
I understand although everyone needs some alone time too.
That is really scary_comma_ did you find them?
That is a relief_comma_ that is one of my biggest fears
why did he do that
that sucks
how big is he?
i can imagine
I don't watch basketball. Is that bad?
Was he supposed to sign with another team?
That is awful!  You deserve so much better
I know.  I am so sorry that you had to go through that. 
Congratulations! Are you excited?
I love being an aunt! I get to spoil other people's kids!
How big was the spider?
Lol
whats the plan to get into one of those cars?!
you got the right idea
Ew_comma_ why not a napkin
Times are tough
I am sorry to hear that.  Will he be okay?
I'm confident everything will be fine.
I am sorry to hear that_comma_ that's terrible.
I'd gladly be your friend if you want.
Oh no! I am sure you were embarrassed. 
That's not very nice of them at all. Are you ok?
What happened?
Try smoking weed? It's a lot better than chemotherapy
When does it start?
Oh wow! I thought it didn't start until fall. What do you do during football season thats special?
that sounds like a good friend
thats good
Inflation sucks
Hopefully we don't turn out like Zimbabwe or the Weimar Republic
That is a very healthy way to think.
We all need to appreciate the good things in life.
That can be hard sometimes. Have you talked to them about it?
I would try and be honest with them about it and tell them it makes you uncomfortable. 
Thats great! So many do not have a safe place to go when they leave
I have been there. I didn't have anywhere to go. I am glad you got out!
Hugs!
thats awesome
thats all you can do to get where you want to go
Good luck!!!
I hope you win!
oh no_comma_ you ok?
well at least you are ok!
Why_comma_ what happened?
Are the dogs ok??
That is great news.
Did you tell him you are proud?
What happened?
Who killed who?
Yes_comma_ me too! That's very sad. We do have much to be grateful for!
Yes_comma_ that's all we can do. Keep trying to do better in life_comma_ and help others.
I bet you were afraid. Was everything fine?
Nice_comma_ I bet you were very prepared.
Oh goodness_comma_ what was it?
I'm glad it wasn't something serious.
I would be far more surprised if you did.
That's just stastics.
was everyone ok?
oh no
In a cool antique way or a disgusting way?
That is so gross. Did you complain to them?
Is it getting boring?
What do you do?
thats the worst!
yea thats rude
Ooo! What kind was it?
Oh! Great choice for the environment. Are you going to save up?
what are you gonna do? partyyyyy?
that sucks
I know what you mean. That's no fun.
Do you have any hobbies or do you like to read?
I'm sure it will be helpful
Bigger vehicles are so convenient for stuff like that!
Yes_comma_ it seems like that was just a couple of months ago.
Before we know it we will be voting for president again.
That is a horrible feeling I know_comma_ but you can start over again the next day.
Don't be too hard on yourself. Allow yourself to indulge every so often.
Where did they go?
What did you do while they are gone?
Aww.  Why?  Did something happen?
Yikes.  How are you today?  
That was nice of her.
Do you stay in touch?
Weekdays always seem to pass so slowly_comma_ but weekends fly by not even noticing them
Do you have any plans for this upcoming weekend?
Nice! Do you see yourself marrying her?
I hope everything turns out good for you two!
That's cool. I don't watch too much. Are you a fan?
Are the cowboys your favorite team? I prefer watching college. 
Wich one?? My favorite was the shining 
Yes_comma_ that one is very scary
I am too_comma_ things are going great.
I'm glad you're being enthusiastic.
What did you lie about?
I assume you were trying to be a good friend and protect them?
What did you eat?
Where did you go after you left?
Nice_comma_ what SUV?
I need to google that. Is it a big SUV?
My sons are always talking about the new video games coming out. What game are you waiting on?
I have never heard of that game. I bet it will be fun though.
What kind of paintings does she do?
Wow_comma_ does she sell them anywhere?
That's not a reason to dislike someone.
Yeah I do to. Does he plan on losing weight?
You like Donald Trump?
Me too_comma_ he's so real. He loves what I love. MMA_comma_ poker_comma_ guns_comma_ WWE_comma_ hahahah
Yes_comma_ but do you drive safe?
True but the odd's are slim.
I'm sorry that you feel lonely.
Absolutely_comma_ never be a victim.
happy birthday! What year is it?
Time flies fast! Make sure to do what you love and be with who you love
Oh I bet she will love that. How old is she?
Don't let the secret slip!
That's great! Congrats!
I am sure it was well-deserved.
Oh man I am so sorry! I have lost many this year too. I hope he had a long life
Oh man! What happened?
I sorry that you have to deal with that.
Yeah_comma_ you need to get of there quickly.
Why?  Previous bad experienec?
True.  It's always good to go outside with a friend.  And don't forget your towel!
I wish that was not the case_comma_ I would have came.
I hope you have much brighter days moving forward.
Oh wow! I would have been scared to let mine do such a thing.
That's good to hear. She must have a lot of your trust_comma_ sounds like a bright young lady!
Is that relaxing to you or lonely? 
Try to enjoy the quiet but not get down.
How did it go?
Well congratulations!
I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ did you lose your job?
I hope things work out for you.
Didn't you check your bought items more thoroughly before putting them in a bag
Seems some irresponsible employee of theirs mis-categorized the items when putting them in those shelves
Thats too bad. I hope everyone remained respectful. Seems like everyone is being kind of childish about politics lately and getting mean fast instead of keeping it decent.
I am seeing a lot of nastiness. Yes_comma_ just remember everyone can agree to disagree and be ok. I hope everything is ok!
How exciting! I am jealous!
That sounds very fun. I might have to take you up on that offer. I have a good friend that just moved there.
Do you trust them to be home alone?  I bet you're scared_comma_ huh?
That's good.  You're a good parent!  Good luck with everything!
I hope you guys are always safe!
I wish I was a good driver!
That sounds fun! 
I bet place that is so big you can't go through it all in one day
That's no good. Did you study?
I understand that. That just means you have to excel at the rest of your assignments so you have a chance to average it out!
That is so sad. I am sorry.
That's a very nice way to think of it.
Oh how exciting!  What is it?
Awesome!  I'm sure you will do amazingly.  Keep your head up!  Fake it til you  make it LOL
Aww_comma_ that is so sweet.
You are lucky to still have that.
Wow have you gone for a ride in it?
That's so cool_comma_ maybe one day you can save enough for you rown.
Oh is the new extra space a good thing?
I can imagine that being a bit lonely.
I know how that feels. It is horrible!
That is good to hear that it doesn't happen anymore.
sorry to hear that. What happened
sorry_comma_ i hope they apologized for that
sorry about that_comma_ did you try checking on another store?
am sorry_comma_ maybe you should wait until they are restocked
I'm sorry_comma_ did everything get resolved?
I'm glad everything worked out.
 Oh my gosh_comma_ seriously???
I am so sorry ab out that I hope things get better soon
That is so annoying. Maybe you'd have to get a chart to keep track.
That is too bad. I am sorry you have to deal with that.
Congratulations! You must be so proud.
Wow it sounds like he has life all planned out.
Oh yeah_comma_ do you love basketball a lot?
Well I hope you enjoy it!
Did everything turn out okay?
We all have our moments.
That's horrible. Must have been annoying_comma_ huh?
Wow_comma_ that's very fortunate. Mothers are great.
That's great! What's going on?
That's nice that you have a friend like that.
Wow_comma_ that sounds like a very busy household. How are you able to manage them all?
A nanny is a good idea. Would you consider using contraceptives? 
If you don't like such movies you should have told him at the beginning so he choose  a non scary one
It's ok though at least now you know that scary movies are not your kind of movies
Ouch! I know that hurts_comma_ been there too. Does it feel better now?
Yes_comma_ it makes you want to say more than darn_comma_ that's for sure!
Why did you go to the movies by yourself?
That is great being so independent.
Ooh_comma_ did you pick your own numbers?
That's awesome! I hope you win!
was it a young kid? sad nonetheless
Oh that's great! I tend to follow some missing children stories closely but I hate when there's a sad outcome
Ooh how fun you must have many adventures planned.
Well I hope it is super awesome!
I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ do you know any way to help yourself calm down?
Well you could also try praying! 
Wow that's fantastic!
You are very lucky to have such a smart boy!
Holy heck are you okay? Was it like_comma_ a fender bender or a full on collision? 
Freaking idiots on the road. Is your insurance going to be able to cover the damage?
Oh that sucks! I can barely do 5 without needing a break
That's quite unfortunate. I feel for you as I used to live in a small town where jobs were scarce. It's rough when there is no competition
Where are you going?
Oh that's never fun. I hate that too.
That is so cool you are moving into the job market. Yay!
I trust you did well too
How does it make you feel when you think about them?
Aww I am sorry to hear that. I hope you can regain contact with them someday. I'm sure they'd love to hear from you.
Why is that?
Oh maybe you should try joining  achurch.
those were the good times_comma_ now kids just want to be on their phones
I used to love riding my bike around the block
Oh no_comma_ that's terrible. Can it be replaced?
What kind was it?
That's sweet of her! You should put them all together in a nice photo album.
That is very kind. I'm honestly doubt that my grandma even knows what a printer is.
sorry to hear that. Sometimes there can be a technical  problem
sorry about that_comma_ seems their customer service is not welcoming
Some people think they know all the answers. It's sad as they usually don't grow as much as people
I hope he does_comma_ for his sake. But I imagine he will come around
If you report him to his wife_comma_ the shame will make him pay you back
Then talk to someone that he respects maybe they will talk senses into his "head"
It's a chance to turn a new leaf by  getting a high score even without cheating
That's good. The first step towards turning new is to resolve and take action. 
Good for you! Stealing from anyone is a really bad offence. 
Having proof is awesome_comma_ otherwise it would make your case a hard one to prove.
Wow_comma_ I would have been upset! How did you react?
Are they going to pay you back for it?
Wow_comma_ you must have done lots of reading then? i dont get As all the time
thats great. They now have confidence in you
No. I hope it was a pleasant day for you and not sad
If you know where you're going then you should be
That is very nice
Did they brought any special gift?
That is terrible! Why did you blame him?
I'm glad you understand that now.
Oh lol_comma_ I'm sure it was embarrassing but it's happened to most_comma_ so understandable. 
I'm sure_comma_ I'd be the same way too!
Are you stoked about something good?
That's great!  Where are you headed for your vacation?
Do you have anything you want to see there?
I feel the same as long as I am treated with respect
That is interesting
I have felt like that as well :)
I think the reason is because we want to know if they would fit or not or if we made a mistake or not_comma_ that's how it is when it's not bought from a physical store
Wow. You must be very proud
I wonder if he was self motivated
Awh_comma_ that really bites. It's the worst when it feels like everyone is having fun without you.
That's right! It will all pay off for you in a few years.
What is it about them that you don't like so much?
Ah yes_comma_ I know that feeling. Sitting in traffic is a major drag. I find that music or podcasts help it go by quicker
Aww!  Tell me about it will you?  
You should go to reddit.com/r/eyebleach.  There's nothing there but cute and nice things to look at.  It will ease your soul.
That's very unfortunate. That cashier needs to find a job they actually like doing.
They're supposed to either do that for you or get someone else to 
Are you ok?
I understand. It is difficult to have everyone staring at you
That's great! I don't know too many people who look forward to that. You must love your job
Great! I wish I loved my job and work environment as much as you do
I feel the same about my dog. They really are like family members.
I will just think they are happily watching down over us and try to go on one day at a time.
Oh really?!  Tell me about it I'm excited to hear!
Oh that is freaking awesome!  Congrats!  How are you going to treat yourself??
You must be a very special person to her. Is she single? 
Too bad_comma_ oh well_comma_ if things turn around in her status_comma_ you have someone in her that you can consider
Oh no! I hope you can make it! 
Whoa_comma_ that's quite a walk! I hope that doesn't happen. Do you have anyone to call for help?
Oh no_comma_ what happened? 
Who can blame you? We are taught to trust professionals.
Why's that?
Oh excellent.  What is your dream car?
Are you buying it outright?
What color are you shooting for?
That is a great accomplishment!
Congratulations_comma_ I'm sure it will be a good PC.
Good memories I take it? I loved not having to make it myself
Aw_comma_ well that's good that it did. I'm sure she wanted it to be!
Was she a bad employee?
Then what caused you to fire her?
sorry about that_comma_ you could have called a friend
yah_comma_ or get a comedy or get to watch a movie
Yeah I remember those days too!  What was your favorite gift from a family member?
Go Grandma!  What an awesome gift.  I bet you were stoked! :D
Excellent!  Those thoughts are beautiful.  Have a good day :)
How exciting! Do you know what your destination will be?
Nice! It will be a good time to relax and enjoy the beach and nightlife!
Oh_comma_ I know that feeling! I only just got my first decent smartphone this past year!
It's definitely different than what I was used to. It's crazy how fast technology upgrades. Sometimes I feel like a caveman.
I am sure you will find a great girl soon!
Just be patient and everything will fall into place.
Oh no! I hope it goes well as I've heard those can be tricky procedures
You'll be fine! Having hope is the best you can do
Really? It is a fine movie
Ok. I understand
Oh my god. What did you do?
That's great_comma_ I hope you weren't hurt!
Oh that's terrible.  Did he say how he lost it?
Do you remember the title?  Maybe you can get another copy.
How was that for you? Are you close?
I'll bet. It's always nice to see someone who can bring back good memories.
Why? Was it because you didn't take those last few moments to spend time with her? Sometimes we have so much going on_comma_ we don't have time to do it all!
Oh_comma_ no_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that. You had no idea that would be the last visit_comma_ but I can understand how you would feel that way. I have no doubt she understood why you didn't though.
Ooh_comma_ that's cool! What did you have in mind? 
That's a good idea. What restaurant were you thinkin? 
That's awesome. What kind of job?
You'll do great! That's right up your alley.
I've never been in one_comma_ but I always assumed they were cleaner!
Ew_comma_ that's gross. Some people have no sense of decency. 
Oh really?  What's the good news?
That's great!  What finally convinved the boss?
It's good to get noticed for that.  most of the time you only get attenton for messing up!
What model or brand of laptop were you considering?
Nice! So you've had a good experience with that brand?
That's fantastic! Congratulations! Is it at a restaurant or home prepared?
That sounds awesome_comma_ honestly. I hope you enjoy it!
Aww that's too bad.  What was the cause?
That's pretty rough.  Were her last years happy_comma_ at least?
I'm sorry you feel that way. If you feel that you do good_comma_ honest work_comma_ you should demand better pay!
If it's a personal matter_comma_ I would definitely take the issue over to human resources. It's better to stand up for yourself.
How long has he been a swimmer?
As you should be. I wish I liked to swim.
Oh my gosh_comma_ that's such a heavy thing to think about. Did you ask her or confront her?
Well_comma_ I hope they've figured it out together during this time. 
That sounds like a wonderful surprise. Was it something that you had seen before?
Are you going to wear it or put it up for safe keeping?
Those tests can be stressful. How did you do?
Awesome! Congratulations! It is always nice to accomplish something like that.
Sorry to hear that. How that happened?
I understand. Those thing happened from time to time.
That's so nice! What did you get her?
Wow_comma_ that is really thoughtful.
Ouch that's rough. Maybe she just isn't ready. 
Do you have any proof? If so you should bring it up to her.
oh you mean not having enough to pay your rent?
I am sure there is a special friend that can help you with that amount and when you have you can repay them back
Oh no! Are you thinking about buying another one?
The meaningfulness is definitely something you can never replace. I hope that it shows up_comma_ and if not_comma_ I hope this watch brings meaning to your life in new ways.
Wow_comma_ that's... odd.  Was it for a cake?
Hahaha Sorry I just assumed you were 5 years old or something.  Yeah getting practical gifts is more appealing as one gets older.
What kind of things did you get?
These days that is a great gift_comma_ am I right?
If it wasn't your fault_comma_ then what caused you to lose?
Multiplayer games can be fun_comma_ but that's certainly a downfall to them!
Oh my. How did that happen?
I see. Well it's an honest mistake. I've done different socks before
You will be fine_comma_ just get a new one
I understand how you feel_comma_ I used to have one like that_comma_ when It passed away_comma_ I got a puppy of the same exact breed and gave it the same name. with a few month_comma_ It looked like the one that passed away so It helped me to forget 
Really? did you use marijuana ?
Did you?
Wow_comma_ I bet that's exciting_comma_ but also makes you a bit nervous. Congratulations though_comma_ I'm sure you are proud to do it!
Well_comma_ I would probably feel the same way_comma_ but I'm sure you will be great. If they didn't have confidence in your abilities_comma_ they wouldn't have chosen you to do it!
Oh no! I hope you were able to get over the disagreement.
Customer service is very important_comma_ and it seems like that place needs to work on that.
What's wrong with your sight?
That's good _comma_a speed recovery I must say.I commend the opticians
Well_comma_ if the milleage is not too much and the car is clean go for it
I think in situations like this_comma_ you can take someone that knows about cars along
Congratulations! That is such a big step in life.
What is his name?
What's got you feeling down?
How inconvenient! Are you going to take it to a technician?
What was she doing?
There is a lot of that type of behavior now. It's like people have lost their minds.
That's awesome. What did you end up getting?
I love chocolate cake! You'll have to save me some.
That can be sad_comma_ but luckily you can plan to visit them in the future.
Yes_comma_ using social media really helps us connect with friends and family so much better.
Oh yea_comma_ I've had it happen a few times. It's even worse when they "lose the package" for a while
I don't blame you. I try to keep tabs on them because I don't trust they will be delivered in time. I also set up a camera to catch deliveries that don't deliver :}
Congratulations! I'm sure it's well deserved!
How are you going to celebrate?
I hate having car troubles! What is it this time?
My sister is recently going through the exact same thing. It was frustrating for her for a while_comma_ but things are looking up for her! I'm sure they will for you as well.
Of what?
Nice reminiscent
Oh yeah? What about?
Oh no_comma_ that is sad news indeed. I am sorry to hear that.
That's a shame. Is there someone else who can go with you? I'm available. LOL
I'm sure she really wanted to go. Sometimes we have to make choices we don't like. My offer still stands. 
What was your experience like?
I love looking at old photos_comma_ both happy and sad moments.
Me too! What did yours look like? 
Wow_comma_ that must've been really spoooky.
hi
not for the time
I'm happy to hear that
You must've worked hard to get there
What were you expected to be served?
So how did you handle it?
Why is that? and what was 
Congratulations. You must have the gods smiling on you
Happy birthday to him! What did he get? 
I bet_comma_ those sound like awesome presents!
That's awful. Did you have to cheat?
I hope she has forgiven you then
Oh_comma_ no! I hope you are feeling better! Did you go to the doctor to see why?
That was very sweet and thoughtful too. Glad you're better!
Wow_comma_ that's a long time! Kudos to you. It's hard for me to imagine being in one place for that long
Yea_comma_ benefits and pay seem to be the common motivators. I'm glad it worked out so well for you!
You will be alright_comma_ it's always like that 
Think about the positive aspects of this_comma_ you are moving forward
Really? What sort of things have you done that make you feel that way?
That sucks_comma_ hopefully nothing you can't replace. I'd suggest getting some help if your drinking has become distructive.
Why? What happened?
I see. lol. I hate cats_comma_ sorry
OK _comma_why would you in the first place?
Well _comma_you played hard! But did you work hard?
That's ok
Tell me all about it
ok_comma_ so sweet

yes_comma_ my patner is very important relationship.
Sorry about that_comma_ what is wrong
sorry_comma_ those horror movies can scare you to death.
Are you high young man? It's just wednesday..hahaha
Oh ok_comma_ I understand. Well_comma_ I have this girl that I have been wanting to date. I want to ask her to be my girlfriend this weekend
This is true.  I have often been told that I am the best.
Where do you go to school?
Whoa! What was in that burrito?
Wow_comma_ that's a food challenge type of thing! Did they get anything out of it?
That's great! What was it about?
I'm glad you really enjoyed it!
Good for you. Don't live with regrets. Learn from mistakes and move on.
That's a weird term to use
Why? Did something bad happen to you?
Well_comma_ I'm glad no one was hurt at least. :)
That's cool! Has it been a good transition?
It can be stressful sometimes. I am glad to hear you found something good.
Thats sweet.  How long have they been married?
Yes it is.. thats great that their love has lasted so long.
That's good! You should always encourage your children's talents and let them grow
I do not. I am still pretty young so I'd like to wait a few more years. I don't think I'm quite ready
Oh that's good. You will make some good money while having a good time remembering childhood
oh ok I understand 
LOL. Sorry. Was it embarrassing or did you laugh it off?
Oh my. But why do you care if they're your cousin..
Really? Please tell me more
So what did you do ?
That is quite interesting. You must be proud of yourself!
I am glad you are. A good career is essential to live a healthy life.
Congrats! Where are you going?
OH I'm so jealous! Have lots of fun!
Oh I love camping.   Was it relaxing?  Sometimes camping can be work.
Im glad.. it seems like we both are getting the vacations we need!
That's great to here. Anything good happen recently?
Sounds like you are doing great. Those are among the best things in life.
You did super well I guess
your parents must be really proud of you
Oh no! I hope your toe is feeling better!
Luckily it will heal soon and you can feel back to normal.
Thats so sweet.
thats super nice_comma_ thanks for sharing.
Oh no! Was it traumatic?
That's nuts! I would have been so scared
The little ones always feel so fragile_comma_ what did you do?
Little ones love rockers or swings_comma_ did you have a good time watching your cousin?
What grade did he get? He doesn't have to get an A in everything.
That's quite harsh for getting one bad grade. You should encourage him to do well without being so rash.
I am sorry to hear that_comma_ You can take it again though and try to get a better grade!
Oh_comma_ that is not good. You should have done better!
Well_comma_ good thing is you realized your mistakes 
You should get your mind ready for the worst if he does not take it too well
Thats always a good thing.  Did you give them a fun reward?
Thats so cool..  I live in Orlando.. I'll wave to you guys!
Wow! That is really impressive!
Luckily the phone didn't fall and crack the glass! Those phone covers aren't the best.
I bet he was stoked.
yea i 100% agree with that.
Oh wow_comma_ what subject is it on?
Well I hope you do good either way.
That is sad_comma_ Why were you not able to go?
Oh maybe next time!
I'm sorry to hear about that.  I hope you both can find a way to work things out with each other.
Oh_comma_ that's too bad.  Well then I hope you can find happiness again in the future.  Good luck to you!
That was nice of you. What type of food did you bring?
I see. That was nice of you to repay your friend with the meal.
Oh that sucks sounds like a good movie tho.
yea the cgi in movies is stellar.
Oh no.  Don't say that!  I start a new job today!
Why don't you talk to yours?  Im so sorry!
That is disgusting! You must talk to him about this!
Incredible_comma_ kick him out of the house!
Oh no! Sorry to hear that. How are you planning to get it fixed?
Ah_comma_ I see. Well I hope you figure it out soon. You need a way to get around town!
That sounds fun! I've never been myself_comma_ but I've always wanted to
I shall :) I need to make myself get out more. It would be good for me
Maybe you should buy it for keep sake 
oh ok_comma_ I understand
Oh that's got to be very tough! I'm sorry to hear that. How did you respond?
That would be pretty shocking overall! I hope you're able to move on from this somehow.
oh really find anything cool?
yea all of the nostalgia can do that.
You must felt really lonely because you need friends in college
I bet it can. I had no friends in college either.
Congrats. I hope you'll like what you're doing
That's like the toughest job out there.
Uh oh! So what happened? Did you end up passing it?
That's great. Good for you_comma_ bud.
Where did you land in then? India or something?
Aw well that seems like it would be a great time! I hear the beaches are beautiful.
Oh my goodness! Why did you do that?
You should tell your wife to clear your guilt.
oh my god!. I hope he loves her as much as you do
Did she know that  you crushed on him?
Oh that sounds kind of worrisome.
well thats a relief.
Did he? Where do you both go to school?
I bet it was_comma_ college is such a great time.
Wow that sounds pretty stressful. How do you think you did?
As long as you did your best_comma_ I say have no regrets. You made the most of a bad situation.
That's great! I'm happy for you. Will you be getting a raise?
I'll cross my fingers alongside you. It sounds like you deserve it!
Oh that must have been awkward.  Did you two talk to each other?
I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope you don't dwell on it too much and can be happy in the future.
Wow_comma_ where did you do that?
That's awesome! I really want to go paragliding someday.
Oh my_comma_ what did you do?
Its okay_comma_ hopefully it was not too expensive1
That's a very exciting time in life. Do you have any preference for gender?
I've heard that as well. I'm male I know I was much closer to my mom.
That's great_comma_ congratulations
He will turn out to be a great man
Oof i know how that can feel.
yea that would help clear you concision 
ok how did you manage the situation?
I think you should have talked to the hostel management to help you out on this as well
That has got to be hard on the poor guy. Did you offer any help?
I see. Well he's probably still there.
Oh wow! That's horrible! Did it fall down the drain?
Well hopefully she should be able to forgive you. It was an accident.
They're not very good friends then. You should confront them about this.
Could be_comma_ hopefully the wont dismiss you like that in the future!
Oh my_comma_ I hate when that happens. It makes me so angry.
I would be too_comma_ some people shouldnt be driving. 
oh yea why is that?
oh wow thats so stupid of him.
That is great_comma_ did you get the license?
Well hopefully you ace it!
That sounds great! What's your meeting about?
That sounds really interesting. Hopefully you'll get rewarded for your great performance!
Oh that sucks but i think he should understand the situation.
thats unfair of him.
Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Were you hurrt?
Hopefully insurance will be able to cover the car at least.
Oh wow that is an awesome car.
i can imagine you would_comma_ its an awesome situation.
You shouldnt feel bad. It happens to all of us at some point.
Its okay_comma_ it was just an accident.
I would be really frustrated with that as well. Did you exchange the colors?
Well it sounds like she's listening to you at least.
Congratulations. You have done well
I wish I can attend a party for this if there is
I agree_comma_ these shop mechanics can be extremely knowledgeable when it comes to computers.
yea but at least now you have found a good_comma_ trustworthy place.
Well that sounds like a good thing to do.
Well I'm happy for you as well that your needs are being meet.
He should be understanding of that and not keep on. That's just frustrating for everyone involved
Sounds very immature if you ask me
Omg!_comma_ does the place have camera? at least so that the police can track down the person
If you have insurance I think you will be fine
oh that sucks_comma_ i know how that feels_comma_ its why i got an extra job online
Yea it was scary but im happy its not bad anymore.
I agree. Do you have a new car?
Oh cool. I love visiting car shows myself.
OK let me in on it
So what was the experience like ?
Why does that make you feel bad? You're allowed to have fun sometimes.
Oh that would be tough. Have you told your partner?
You must be quite hopeful to get this new job then! I hope you do as well.
I agree_comma_ but stay positive. There is nothing you can do now.
I hope I will still be helping my kids when they are grown up. I like to feel they will always need me. 
Yes_comma_ but they can be a bit of a challenge when they are growing up!
You should definitley pick them up again. Don't let age stop you!
lol well as long as you're fairly active and fit it shouldn't be too big of a problem.
Why_comma_ did you hesitate in the first place?
I see than_comma_ I could tell you that you should just overcome yourself and do it_comma_ but its you own personal business...
Wow that sounds rough! Have you told your wife about it?
I could imagine. I hope you're able to work through this somehow.
Is there still time to get one? You can if you hurry!
Hmm I think you should make it up to her somehow. Take her to an expensive dinner. 
Oh my goodness. Who is that guy?
What an impostor. 
It's a great stage in your life_comma_ what is he majoring in?
Well I wish luck to both of you.
Is there anything that could spoil that?
Seems like you took all the precautions_comma_ the rest is not up to you.
I hate when that happens.  Things always seem to go that way.
All you can do is just keep doing the best job you can and hopefully someone will notice someday.
Your dog doesn't keep you good company?
I guess so but it should be able to alleviate a lot of that loneliness.
Congrats. Boy or girl?
I'm having a boy soon. 3 months or so
sorry to hear that. I hope he is okay now
he will be okay as long he got the tratment
Well_comma_ early happy birthday. What will you do to celebrate?

That's great_comma_ how much did you win?
Still more than you started with.  For that ticket anyway.  LOL.  Congrats.
Oh that sounds like so much fun! I love animals!
Hopefully she'll get more interested when she gets a bit older.
What happened to the cat??
My condolences to the owner. 
That is so aggravating! I am sorry to hear this happened to you!
Call the police! I hope you nab these guys and put them in jail!
That sounds horrible. Are you trying to motivate them?
I can understand the feeling. I always feel ignored.
Oh_comma_ sorry to hear that. I was under a lot of stress. What happened to you?
Oh no_comma_ sorry hope it wasn't a snake. My hound dog is alwayd barking.
Yah_comma_ lost my job and trying to find a new one.
Oh my_comma_ that is along time. Did you feel nostalgic? 
I see_comma_ you should rekindle your friendship.
I know that feeling! Maturity I suppose
Its that feeling you have to live with for now.. Lol!
Why_comma_ what did you do_comma_ to feel like that?
Are you planning to make up for it?
You are so lucky to have such caring sister
I hope you can reciprocate by sending her a birthday message  when it's time for it so she knows you care for her 
I'm really sorry to hear that. How long did you have it for?
That's really tough right now. I hope you're doing something fun to keep yourself occupied.
I really hope you are alright. Did they catch him?
Do you at least remember how he looks?
Are't you afraid to catch the fever?
Good for you_comma_ I hope your sister gets well too.
What do you mean they stepped up but you still had the title. Wouldn't they be the ones with that?
Oh cool. Well I'm happy for you guys

What's the first thing you would do if you won a few million?
oh wow_comma_ you should have known better
try harder next time and im sure you will do better!
i agree_comma_ I love Fridays_comma_ Did you have any plans?
Sounds like a great plan. Also a great way to get diabetes!

Really?
What happened?
5 what?
I would like that much money!
What business?
Did you have a back up plan?
Well_comma_ now you that such is life_comma_ it makes plans for you.

Oh yes. I love that show I can relate to real life families.
Yes_comma_ I saw him. Very blessed and talented man.

That's a great feeling_comma_ I agree! I rarely get a day where I just stay home

I like to be lazy as much as I can.
Sorry about that.I know how it feels_comma_especially with the family concerns
Please never stay idle _comma_fix yourself anywhere_comma_ I mean somewhere
Oh wow that is terrible I hope you recover everything that was taken from you
I completely understand I have had my car broken into a few times and had objects that held value and were sentimental to me as well
Good luck! Have you studied for it? Do you feel prepared?
Don't be paranoid. That just upsets you. Try to think positivley.
That sounds aggravating. Did you say anything to her?
Thats okay_comma_ you should call the police next time.
Yeah_comma_ Tuesday is just the beginning of the week and more to go. Is that why?
So true
It always feels exciting to do something big at work. It always feels good to feel like you are making progress in your career. 
Also_comma_ maybe this is something you can put on your resume and it will look good in the future. 
Sorry about that. You should try again and stay confident. The most important is to try.
Good. Stay focus and you will have success. We always learn something in our good and bad experiences.
Congratulations. Are you going by yourself? 
Have fun you two!
Eww_comma_ that must have so disgusting. You should report this to the FDA.
Oh I see_comma_ try and avoid expired food next time!
Oh?  Where is she going?
Aww man!  That is a long time to be without your wife.  I bet you're going to miss her :(
Oh_comma_ no I hope you found him and he is ok.
Do you know where he went
time to lay the smack down
yea i can believe it.. but it makes you feel better!
what...? you were in the toilet? and they were trying to get in? whut? i am so confused_comma_ why would they do that?
that is really weird_comma_ I would be so stunned if that was happening to me_comma_ and its not like theres only one toilet on a plane usually so wtf. was she still there when you got out?
Oh I'm sorry. Have you tried to talk to people?
You can try again to reach out to people. Otherwise_comma_ remember that it is only temporary... soon you will be in a different class with more opportunities to make friends.  
Nice_comma_ it is always to good to celebrate your birthday in a fancy way every few years!
That is quite interesting. I hope your day went very well!
That is gracious of you. I haven't done that in awhile.

Fun
That's really great that you have someone to take them out of the house and help out!
Becoming a parent is funny_comma_ I used to so look forward to summers. Now_comma_ even though its nice to have time with them it adds new challenges.
That is wonderful to have a personal touch for your wedding. It makes it all the more special. 
That's great that you had a backup plan for that. It sounds like it was great and I bet everyone was very impressed!
oh happy for you buddy
how much did it cost?
I'm sorry_comma_ how does that make you feel?
Well_comma_ you can always try to get a promotion next time! 
No_comma_ Congratulation. Do you have something planned today?
That is nice.
oh what really went wrong
yeah its problematic in such kind of job interviews
Are you talking about a co-worker of yours?
Did you have a conversation about not meeting deadlines?
How did it go?
Ok
Really?
What exactly did you do for the school year book?
That is wonderful. I use to love English classes in college.
Its great when family get together. Do you do that on special occasions only?
Exactly. You must feel very happy when that happens.
I understand
Then you need to take a break 
Nice_comma_ is that within your skill set?
That's fantastic. 
Yeah I agree.  Do you have a long trip coming up?
Awesome!  Is your family going with you?
That sounds like fun!  I hope you enjoy your trip!!! Be safe!

You can still turn it in! Just drop it off to the police or the people in charge at the subway. 
I would feel bad to but save up some cash put it back and bring it back. you got this. 
That is nice. You don't go anymore in family?
Sorry to hear that. It is good a idea.
very true.. do you live alone now?
i feel you.. but look on the bright side_comma_ it makes the moments being together far more special
oh damn.. it is kind of funny yes
lol.. i guess that would be a cool story to tell you child when she grows up huh?
I am sorry to hear that.  Do you have any meds that could help relieve the pain?
Maybe you should rethink going to the dentist if you're in so much pain.
Oh_comma_ how did you like it?
I'll have to check it out_comma_ thanks for the rec! I've been meaning to add more things to my "must watch" list.
oh wow I really hate snakes_comma_ I would've freaked out! What did you do?

hrmmm wonder if its a ghost or a rodent?
oh wow.. that is strange
lol_comma_ you are so lucky to have such a sweet brother. what do you buy him in return?
haha.. thats hilarious_comma_ i thought he was spoiling you!
Oh no_comma_ have you found him yet? 
I really hope so that sucks. Put out some dog food_comma_ some water_comma_ maybe one of his favorite toys.

oh wow i would think it would take longer

I would have moved that same night_comma_ and probably changed my identity thats terrifying!

i hope the cops took care of it
Oh god_comma_ how so what happened? 
Sounds like florida ugh 
Wow you too! It's crazy how many bad drivers there are.
Well I'm glad you weren't hurt.
Yikes_comma_ that's a tough place to be in. She's very forward for asking something like that too.
They do and you never know what could happen_comma_ let's say you guys get into a fight and then she trashes your house! Not a good outcome!
That sucks! I cant save money at all I always overspend even just for groceries. I hope you can save up atleast al ittle money and take like a "daycation" ! 
Im always living on a budget so even if you could atleast treat yourself for a day_comma_ or 1 night then do it! You deserve it I am sure you are working hard. 
Cool! Where are you going?
That's pretty awesome. I have never been that far!
Mexico. I went to cozumel once

oh thats nice 
Same as me! Everyone is always shocked to know that
Well_comma_ truth be told I've never gotten one ever which is even more rare. But good on your partner_comma_ really. That's hard to do!
Are you going to have any other roommate or you will be living alone?
Maybe you can post an ad on Craigslist. That way many will see and be interested 
Did the check end up hitting in time?
I would be too. ugh that sucks! 
Oh no. That has happened to me before. 
That is a long tedious process too. You have to have one thing to get the other and they make you run around and get more things. ugh
How many does she have? 
That is a lot wow_comma_ she must really love watching tv atleast it gives her something to do tho! 
That's great. You both must be excited
Are you moving to a better home?
That can be nerve wrecking. How did you do?
What kind of grade did you get?
That's great. Do you visit the casino often?
Yeah I don't have the best luck in casinos either.
Oh dear! Did you get sprayed? That would frighten me too_comma_ especially at night.
Well that's a relief! I'm glad neither of you got sprayed.
wow nice
oh its unfair and really hurts
iam gonna end chant now
Oh wow! how was that? I have never had Taco Bell breakfast.
Oh really? I can understand. I usually regret eating Taco Bell. Especially after the digestive process.
Oh wow! That is a bold move! Which state did you move to/from?
That is awesome. I have considered moving from Missouri down to either Lower Alabama or Florida. 
That's incredible! I would have never expected him to leave Cleveland.

Congratulations. I never payed any sports.

What grade is she in_comma_ and how did it go!? 
Thats awesome! wow congrats mom... I bet you are super excited. 
Do you have a favorite team?
Nice.  I grew up as a Redskin fan and hate the cowboys
How do you feel about New England?
i love all the cardinals in the woods behind my house
i dont want them to suffer either
why did it upset you?
What kind of plans did you have going on?
I hope you called the cops on him.
Good because he's no good for you. You deserve better.
I would love that too lol! What would you do if you won?
Be careful with flying over the ocean! It's a bit scary
its a gift and a curse as they say
thats very true
That's great! How exciting!
Yeah I know what you mean. It probably feels like you're losing a friend.
Wow! Where did they go?
Aw. You miss her. That's sweet. My daughter won't leave the house so I can miss her lol
thats great_comma_ are you usually not able to?
i understand how that goes
I would be mad too. What happened?
How long before you get what is owed to you?
for your job or mental health?
hope it turns out well for you
Don't say that. There is somebody for every single person on this earth.
Don't force it. They usually come around when your not looking.
thats cool.. take any pics?
thats cool
Nice_comma_ did you ace it
I hope you weren't smoking any weed 
What exactly do you mean? Did you expect them to be taken away from him?
Oh dear_comma_ I hope everything works out.
What kind of party?
A close friend? What kind of decorations did he get?
set an alarm on your phone
thanks
What happens on saturday?
Lol_comma_ nice
That's not good at all
Can't you just leave food out? Or set an alarm on your phone?
That sucks
Save up some money for the salon then
why what was the reason
oh that good to hear. nice human beings
yes i do
cause you ran out of candles?
Was it a birthday party?
You probably should feel really bad. Was it a kid's birthday?
Cute? Oh my word
I have never seen a skunk outside before. I'm glad too
Like penguns? that might be cute to see.
It's nice to see someone who loves school! What are you studying?
Lol! Oh my goodness. So you are going to be a police officer or a lawyer?
Oh I am sorry to hear that. Are you normally frightened to go home alone?
Do you have an alarm system. My wife and I have one_comma_ and it automatically texts me if I am away from home and the alarm goes off. 
That is amazing. It is so nice to have someone to share your life with. How long have y'all been together?
Wow! I have been married for a little over 2 years. What is the secret to a long lasting marriage?
Oh I have felt that way before. When did you graduate?
I can totally understand that. I was so excited to get out into the 'real' world. I did one enlistment in the military after high school_comma_ and now I am in college. Rude awakening after high school!
I hear you! What happened?
That's not good. I hope you both can communicate about it in a respectful way.
why any strange things do you found on your neighbour

yeah its great exprerience i loves to drive fast
wow amazing feels great 
wow congrats

oh its really bad to hear
why what happaned?
Oh that's okay! I am as well. Sometimes I trip for no reason whatsoever.
That happens to me often. I also trip walking up the stairs quite often. It can be quite embarrassing!
Me too_comma_ its the only place I get to get away from my wife's constant nagging.
It's no problem. My work comfort's me just like yours does.
That's great! It is so important to be content in life.
What do you do for a living? Does that contribute to your happiness?
Oh wow! Congratulations! I also recently applied for grad school to study Computer Science (seriously). What are you wanting to study?
That is very cool! I don't know about you_comma_ but I have been stressed out about the whole process.
That's great that you love your job_comma_ that is really important!
That is a powerful type of position.
That sounds exciting!  Where are you going?
I've had a lot of friends go there.  What are your specific plans while you're away?
what breed is he?
thats cute_comma_ i bet hes a great dog
I love Mexican food! How was it?
That sounds so good. 
That is great. I love dogs. Do you have any family 
Yay! That is great. Where are you going for vacation?
Wow! That's exciting! Was it what you were looking for?
That's great. Congrats on your home purchase!
That is scary! I've never flown before_comma_ the only time I have ever been on a plane was when I went skydiving.
I also enjoy traveling!
did you intervene?
that is awful
That does not sound good to me_comma_ either. I cannot stand pineapple!
I think it is too acidic for me.
It sounds like you have a fulfilling job. That's great
It's so refreshing to hear someone who really loves what they do.
congratulations!
i am really happy for you
That's awesome! What is the name of the book?
That's great. I produce audio and I have an album coming out by the end of the summer! Tell her to keep it up!
Oh wow! That must be quite nerve-wracking_comma_ although I am sure that you will do great! What are you planning to study?
Oh wow! Do you want to work in schools?
I hate it when salespeople do that. Did you buy something or leave?
ha That's a good strategy.
Probably ate it or threw it away!
Yeah I can!! You ought to put some laxatives in it for next time and see how much they like it then!
Oh that must be relieving.  College in general can be pretty stressful!
I completely understand_comma_ I'm 6 months away from my Associate's degree! Good luck
Thats awesome! You guys will remember that forever. Make sure to catch it on video so you can show her when shes all grown up!
Yes! Its the best feeling ever isn't it? 
That is great!  There is no better feeling than the one you get when your kid makes you proud and happy!
Wow!  He is ahead of the other kids his age!  No wonder why you are so proud!
What food was it
I do like that as well
Break ups normally have that affect 
yes. It is not easy at all. It will get better. one day at time 
Wow_comma_ that is very nice of her!
It's great that your aunt cares about you so much.
They are always busy
I do hate to wait as well
It is eerie_comma_ isn't it. You must have felt quite strange. Hope your poor doggie is ok!
That must've been terrifying for you. It's amazing how we can hear every little thing around us when we're alone!
That's great! You must feel so accomplished! What math class are you taking?
I can understand that! Math has never been my strongest subject. 
that is great! family is the best
i can imagine
That was so nice of him. He sounds very caring.
You are very lucky!
I am sure you will get used to them
That is a challenge_comma_ but thats not a bad thing
Oh man I am so sorry.  Had she had the dog for a long time?
That is so sad.  My dog had congestive heart failure and died so I know how sad that can be
Although you felt bad_comma_ I am sure your friend would understand. 
That is good. Everyone gets busy sometimes.
That does sound fun
I am sure there will be none of those there
I am so sorry to hear that. Dealing with the loss of a loved one is always difficult but feeling alone in the grief must be so much worse. I hope that you are feeling less alone now.
I am sure that it did. Were you very close with your father?
Oh YAY congrats! You should be proud of yourself_comma_ that's a good accomplishment
Yeah_comma_ people get comfortable even if they don't like it. It's sometimes good to try something new.
I did not understand the number 4
Well ... I hope you like it and above all that you study something amazing
It's something we've all done_comma_ dont feel bad. Would he have gotten mad?
If you dont mind me asking_comma_ where was it that you pretended to be?
Ya we've all been there lol. Just be careful and all that_comma_ you'll be fine.
Oh wow_comma_ what aspect of his presidency is bothering you?
I can understand why that upsets you. Are you a Hillary Clinton supporter?
Did you study hard for it?
That's awesome! Are you going to celebrate now or wait until the grades come in?
Mer to
yes_comma_ it it's.It's like a time machine.
I am sorry_comma_ what are you sad about
I have been there. I guess just remember the good times
That's awesome! Congratulations! Are you in college?
That is a wonderful memory. What school did you attend?
That's great! Are you in school or teaching?
That's awesome! I am currently in college myself. I actually just finished two summer courses today. Not going to lie though_comma_ I could use a bit of a break before the fall semester begins.
Oh wow! I am sure that you did great! Did you just finish high school?
I can relate to that. I went into the military after high school_comma_ and I am currently in college. It was a bit overwhelming getting back into the state of mind required for school_comma_ but it is all worth it! What school are you hoping to attend?
It's hard to make this decision ... I'm sorry ... What's your pet's name?
Omar sure will have some new owners who will love it
Why don't you see them anymore?
Aww_comma_ the best thing you can do is keep them alive through your memories.
Why are you happy
Oh wow_comma_ are you excited
I remember that feeling myself back on my first day of college
The first years is the best
Congratulations! That is exciting
but it's over now :) what kind of car?
that's a good car 
I bet that was pretty awkward.
Did the woman say anything to you?
Oh no what did you take?
Did you tell him about it at least?
I love surprises.  What was it?
Nice!  Where did he take you?
Oh wow! Did it work?
I bet you felt really bad. Did you end up telling her the truth?
I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anyone who's there to help her?
That was nice of you.  My parents did the same with my grandparents.  She's very fortunate to have you.
I am sorry to hear; drunk people can make a situation quite difficult to deal with. Have you been friends for long?
I can understand that. You sound like a good friend.
Oh no_comma_ I am so sorry to hear that. Does your mom know?
I am so sorry that your family is going through this horrible time. Is your dad unwilling to end the affair?
I can understand your apprehension. Have you ever served on jury duty before?
I have never served on jury duty either. The closest thing that I have experienced was serving as a guard during a military court martial.
What did she accomplish?
WOW... that is a biggie!
Good for you.You are a person with morals.
We all have thinking that sometimes_comma_ but acting is the wrong thing to do.
Oh mine too_comma_ he is 12 and lost eye sight
Wow_comma_ 15 cant do nothing but love them
were you qualified ?
its all apart of life sometimes
That was really lucky! And also very nice of your sister. What'd you do with the case?
That's really great. Are the trees really tall where you live?
That's terrible! Did he at least live a good life?
Oh man! Be sure to give em a proper sendoff. 
I don't think having designer brand is all that great.
Why does being cool matter though? Wouldn't you rather just be yourself?
Oh yeah.. what happened?
That is the worst.. I've had that happen to me before!
It is nice to have your own place. Think about just being able to do whatever you want. You can just punch your walls if you want.
It's ok just think about it this way. You don't have to pay property taxes or even be worried about your lawn.
do you live in the midwest
do you have an emergency shelter in your basement ?
I hate that_comma_ did you ask them to stop
That isnt good_comma_ sorry
That's fantastic! Senior year can be such a fun experience! I hope that she enjoys it. Is she going to take a senior trip?
That sounds exciting! I went on my first cruise in March; we had a blast!
Oh wow_comma_ he must be proud of himself!
That is some feat_comma_ I wish I could do that!
That would really upset me! How are you going to get to work?
Can you take an uber?
It can be scary_comma_ my sister's in-laws' house got struck by lightning recently.
I think so_comma_ not sure how the house is.
I am sure you will be okay
I am glad it wasnt
That is tough.  Does he help you study too??
Then why do you think he gets better grades?
Did you try watching movies or playing video games?
I understand.
Did you have a great Christmas then?
Holidays are always a nice time to get together. 
Sometimes being alone can be a good thing though
Well I am sure it was a good experience
Oh that is pretty neat. Who is your favorite band anyway?
Oh I like them too. I like that song I think it is called "Change". It is so good.
That would be discouraging.  Did you make new friends?
That's no fun. Hopefully you got some stuff done around the house then.
Oh no.. why what happened?
Thats awesome!  I am tired too I had to be up early today.
Oh! that is pretty nice to come home too.
You better keep him sounds like a keeper.
thats so great! i love my dad too
thats really awesome
Oh man I bet that is a very difficult test. I can't believe how many instruments are in a cockpit!
What a bummer. At least now you know what you need to study for when you take the exam again!
That's unfortunate.  Did the people you work with by any chance surprise you?  Please say yes!
Blow out them candles and make a wish!
Congrats!  What school?
How long must you attend school?
I bet that was fun
That will be fun
That is awesome. Was it high school or college?
Oh cool I bet he had to work really hard to get his degree. I am sure he appreciated your support.
I have those kinds of feelings as well. I think memories are a good thing though
I can understand that for sure_comma_ just remember the good ones
That sounds really nice!  Did you enjoy yourself and relax?
It is a good feeling when you get to just relax and feel laid back.
Ha_comma_ that will be fun though
Ha_comma_ I bet it will be fine
That must have felt sort of defeating.  There is still hope if there isn't a ring on her finger!
Try not to feel that way.  If it was meant to be_comma_ it would have happened.  There are plenty of other fish in the sea!
Oh wow that is awesome. I remember when those came out. Everyone wanted to have one!
It's crazy how many toys they have now. Disney is really pushing the merchandise out!
How'd he do that?
Sounds like a mess_comma_ how much did it cost to replace?
Oh that's not good! What happened?
That's always a pain! It can take forever but never lasts long enough
Man_comma_ that is so sad.  I don't know what I would do if my dog ran away!  Did you ever find him?
That's awesome!  I love a happy ending!
Yeah those guys sure charge a lot. They know they are needed for emergencies_comma_ hah!
That is a trade that can get very messy. I respect guys that get arm-deep in sewage lol!
Is it your birthday?
I hope a nice surprise.
That's always hard to deal with. What did he do?
I'm sorry he did that to you. Maybe it was just a misunderstanding.
I bet you will do well_comma_ sounds attentve
Way to_comma_ it really pays off to study_comma_ and a CPA thats impressive
How sad ... you must be desolate
There are other cats that need help
im sorry to hear that. no chance of working it out?
im sorry to hear that
did you give them the finger ?
i have come across that many times and just shake my head
That must have been really scary. Maybe you like cats instead?
Oh I see. Did you get tested to see if they had any diseases? Strays sometimes have rabies.
Wow_comma_ thank goodness you didnt hit it_comma_ for youre sake and the deer
That can happen_comma_ Ive seen deer walk across a highway
Oh my goodness_comma_ that is terrible.  They don't have insurance?
I was just about to mention that you should be careful that its not a scam of some sort.
Oh my. That would really tick me off. In my state they will lose their license for that.
Well I hope your insurance company sues them. They should really be more responsible.
in a good way or bad way?
a lot of people are suprised by the GDP
Whoa_comma_ that is a good neighbor. I hope you return the favor some time!
Dang. I bet there is a great story of how it got there!
Dang. Did she practice a lot leading up to the recital?
Wow! Maybe I should start taking some piano lessons and go to a recital of my own.
Oh wow. Do you think you are going to go?
That's pretty neat. Where is it at?
That sucks!  Bowling is definitely a hang out with friends kind of sport 
You should join a league and meet some friends with similar interests.
That's odd. Were they laughing about you?
Oh wow. You always have to be on the look out for the rogue rip in the pants! That's what got my uncle late in life. RIP in peace.
Whoa I hope you guys have a great honeymoon. Make sure to treat your fiancee right!
Well as long as you have a safe word you should be OK. You also may want to buy some life insurance.
what do you mean by 5?
Ha Ha!  Thats ok.  Ugg...that had to be annoying.  Is he just a puppy
what a joy ... as it is called
Thank God ... that's good
That's awful!
I would have been angry too_comma_ is it cleanable?
That's terrible! How did it feel when it happened? Were you mad?
I would be too. Hopefully you channeled your rage to let him know who is king of the road.
It is very nice. Where would you go first with your new car?
Nice
That's terrible. Are you guys still friends?
That's so sad. Perhaps you should buy him a cake and beg for his forgiveness.
That sounds so relaxing.  What book did you read?
ha ha ha.  Its a good book for sure!
That's too bad. What was supposed to be coming in the mail?
Well that's good. I hope whatever it is you're waiting for improves your life.
Did he do any damage?
Is the sword in one piece?
How is the food usually?
Dim Sum specifically
What kind of coffee will you get?
Are the coffees there expensive?
I agree with you. I think everything will be fine in the end.
It's good to see that you have a positive attitude about it like me.
That is very nice thing to do.
I understand. You are over the water. Nothing bad could happened.
What was the document?
I would imagine he'd be pretty upset
How did you feel?
What kind of car was it?
I had a similar experience the other day at the gas station. It's terrible when that stuff happens.
Yeah but people are only amused because something they fear is happening to someone else. Those people don't matter and it's happened to everyone
oh. was it cancelled?
Just ask him. Or you can make the plans
Oh? Did you have fun?
Ah_comma_ I've never really been into big TVs. I have a tiny one that's good enough for me!
Has he been needy?
How long do you think it'll take for him to recover?
It happens_comma_ sounds like you need to remove all the bad food from your home
Maybe ask a friend to help keep you in check
Wow. Did you call the police?
Just kidding. There is some products that you can use to avoid those bad experience.
Are they against Trump?
Well_comma_ I guess Canada doesn't like to take any shit from Trump
How many?
What are the books about? 
Which wireless service provider do you have?
I heard they have really cheap plans and you don't get locked into a shitty contract like other providers.
That sucks. I hate when my games are interrupted for any reason.
Oh no. You should invest in something new.
Don't let your ex manipulate you!
Tell him to f&^% off!
No rage quitting?
What do you play. I just preordered Call of Duty BO4
I'm gonna look that up
What kind of place is it?
What was your fav dish there?
That is great! You must be so proud!
That is nice that you are so supportive of her.
I bet that brings back a lot of great memories! Is the food good?
What type of food do they serve?
Where on your chest?
Hopefully it works out for you
Wow_comma_ she can already drive?
She sounds like a great babysitter
Like_comma_ What are your weaknesses?
You gonna get the job!
Do you not have them anymore?
I'm sorry to hear that
Well she is in a better place.
Ddi you take classes or something?
I think I have a good eye too.
My mom does that for a living. I could probably be good at it.
You and me both.
What about a soccer team?
That must save you some time.
One step at a time.
What kind of job does he have in the military?
How long has he been there?
Me too_comma_ do you like Trump?
I love how direct he is_comma_ he definitely one of the best presidents in recent years.
I saw the trailer_comma_ looks good.
I saw her fight once. She kicked butt.
I bet that is a great feeling
Well at least things are starting to look positive for you!
I couldn't get into that game.
I tried to play it. I couldnt get into battlefield either. Maps too huge?
Me either I love adventure movies!
Me too! I love them.
Wow_comma_ that is impressive.
What will you study?
It's nice to know there are faithful people still out there. Keep it up!
That must mean you really do love and care about her.
You must see them a lot.
At least you can talk on the phone.
I love the fall.
I used to love the piles of leaves when I was younger. Raking is no fun now.
Nice_comma_ whats the reason?
Will you not go out then?
What happened?
Oh god_comma_ you didn't get attacked_comma_ did you?!
Oh wow. I would have freaked out
Well at least you are okay now.
I love cruises. Where are you guys headed to on the cruise?
Nice! I think I went to Cozumel_comma_ Mexico with my family in like 2013? It was on the Carnival Imagination cruise_comma_ it was awesome!
I would be so mad. I am terrified of snakes.
When I was a kid I used to have nightmares that I was on a bridge in a car and the whole car and bridge were covered in snakes. It was awful.
I just read about that today.  Do you think he will be ready for it?
He definitely is cool to watch.
What did they call about?
Wow that is a long time ago.
That's no good.
People aren't tolerating that type of behavior anymore. She had better watch it.
Are you the mother or father? Time flies so fast..
I bet she is going to be a great person when she is older
What happened?
I bet you are super jealous!
She was probably disappointed at you.
Are you upset about this? I'd try meeting hr in person
Should have grabbed the gun.
I would have shot that thing dead and then burned it. Then ate it for dinner.
That is good to hear. Disabilities are never easy for people.
Nothing upsets me more than people getting handicapped plates and not being handicapped.
Maybe he should give you a raise so you can stay.
Well you have to think about yourself.
Really? Which one was it? 
Was that in the United States or somewhere else? I used to love All My Children and General Hospital. 
Sounds like fun! I wonder if you could find old episodes online now. 
Oh_comma_ cool! Any names I might know?
I was just talking about this with my friend. They are getting too old
i know right.
Did you have plans to pick up something special?
I know that was probably embarrassing then but can you at least laugh about it now?
Are you making some good progress?
You must be quite proud_comma_ how much can you lift?
I can't imagine my house on fire. That's I got home insurance!
I hope you didn't lose too much.
Yeah_comma_ the crime rate has steadily been rising. Not good.
I miss the good ol' days too!
That is awesome. I bet she worked really hard to get that promotion. Good for her.
Cool_comma_ I hope she continues to be successful. It's good you are encouraging her!
It feels nostalgic_comma_ what did you like most about that time period?
Must've been nice_comma_ being so free and enjoying your time.
Yes_comma_ I didn't like it at all. I'm not into jump scares.
Yeah_comma_ no thank you for me.
Was there any reason why?
That's awesome_comma_ I've never had good neighbors so I'm pretty jealous of you!
I call my sister that all the time. 
OH. I'm sorry. We do that to each other. I  didn't know she hurt your feelings.
Thats Sucks I download games so I don't have that problem
I used to have that problem too. Downloading would take days. Technology saved me there.
Oh no_comma_ why is that?
Well as long as they're good people than it shouldn't be that bad. 
What did she do?
Have you told her not to do that?
IT went by fast.
That sucks. Everyone deserves a vacay.
Oh no_comma_ that's the worst to spend time cooking something and then taking a bite and it's awful.
I've done it before so I feel your pain.
Nice! Are you going scuba divng?
Ah_comma_ gotcha. Sounds delicious!
What did you carry for her?
You're so sweet for doing that_comma_ did she thank you?
What ahappened to the vase?
People still play with those?
Who did she blame?
Well if the cat didn't tell the truth he didn't mind atking the fall.
Hey. It happened to me. It could happen to you too!
Have you ever put butter in your noodles. It elevates them lol
I've never used cheese. Learn something new every day.
You know_comma_ thinking about it. I don't think I've ever had a honey bun...
Wow_comma_ that sucks. I bet you are so disappointed...
What kind of list is that? Are you bringing them some Christmas cookies?
Oh so maybe you will leave some coal on their doorstep instead. They should be more considerate.
Ok. That's kinda neat.
Oh I know how that feels.
Aww that's sweet! How old are your kids? 
Yeah I like to have pictures of my loved ones and pets and such at work. It really helps when I'm having a rough day.
Oh no. I would have screamed.
That's nice. No police were involved?
Well at least you're safe.
That's nice.
Aw. No one cooks for me :(
I'm sorry to hear that. What's holding you back? 
You'll get there one day!
Just keep working at it. 
Wow_comma_ the last one? How many seasons have they made?
I need to watch that show in my free time. EVeryone I know talks about that show constantly!
did you get an A?
Come clean and take an F then
Me too. I can focus on myself for a while
I feel the same way.
At least you are thinking back on it and doing some self-reflecting. 
That's so mean. I bet he just wanted to say good morning to you.
What did you do?
Did you buy a new battery?
Yeah_comma_ I really liked those hunting trophies he got. We should be allowed to kill any animals we see!
Oh I was thinking of his son. I don't know much about the Donald besides the Twitter stuff.
No_comma_ that's a little too expensive for me.
It's snails_comma_ isn't it? Why would anyone want to eat that is beyond me.
That is terrible. What was it for?
Now That's a no no. Kill him
Oh wow. I have no advice there.
Maybe you should calming ask about it. 
What are you planning on buying? 
You self-entitled brat! Just kidding_comma_ your mother loves you
Storms? Why?
Everything closes when we get an inch of snow in the south. 
What is this weekend?
Have you met them before?
I am waiting for Halloween. Its my favorite.
Lol. I do themes with me and my kids. Then I eat all of their candy
That's awesome. You guys sound very close!
That is so messed up lol
Oh yeah? I heard the circus had to close recently. What is your favorite part?
Elephants are pretty cool. I wonder if they actually like peanuts?
Did you clean it again?
That was nice of them.
Congratulations
Well that a good thing to study too
Im in school now for psychology. ITs so boring
What do you miss most about being a kid?
Just relaxing and playing?
How old will you be?
Maybe they will party at your house after.
They did? I've never seen a baseball game lol
There are some real die har fans I miaght have to check it out
I don't believe you.
How did you get the opportunity to meet him?
What will be lit?
That sounds boring.
That is scary! As a 26 year old I cannot imagine actually having kids at this age. I'd be running around like a chicken
That's rough! I'm glad you're ok now (I hope)_comma_ but that must have been really traumatic 
Oh no!  Did you have a cell phone or did anyone come out to help you?  I literally hate car problems.
Oh great!  I do not have that kind of knowledge at all - maybe you could come with me on the next road trip - LOL!!  
What kind did they get?
Are you a bit jealous?
It's sad actually. But be happy she become independent.
Yeah_comma_ let her free.
That's crazy! I hope to propose one day. Congratulations!
That's great! Disney is a wonderful place to go. I actually live near The Magic Kingdom!
Ugh_comma_ that is so annoying. Did you say anything?
Good_comma_ maybe he'll learn not to be a jerk next time.
Did you try taken him to a specialist to help with that?
Did you try closing your room?
Rainy days are boring_comma_ but I do like the sound of them. It's calming in a way
Yea_comma_ it is better in moderation. That's true
Who?
That's terrifying. I refuse to swim in the ocean. Too scary.
Glad you are both safe.
Well_comma_ at least you followed the law and didn't end up running a red light.
Yes_comma_ Better safe than sorry I guess.
no _comma_ but i heard about it in commercials 
i will try on do this asap _comma_ dude yesterday i forgot to pay some money i owed my friend_comma_ i felt kinda of ashamed 
i got payed _comma_ went shopping ate dinner_comma_ then my friend messaged me asking for his money .... i had totally forgot about this
Well_comma_ maybe your friend will understand.
I know how you feel.
That is a great accomplishment!
Yeah_comma_ kids grow up so fast!
That makes me mad
Some people should be more considerate
Where did you move to?
Im sorry.. I moved once from MD to FL so I know how you feel being without your peeps.
Oh. That's kind of exciting though
Well be yourself. If it doesnt work out_comma_ think of it as practice!
Hey great! What did you eat?
It is good to just treat yourself sometimes!
Oh don't feel bad! We need to treat ourselves sometimes!
Thats terrible.
I have heard of that. 
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Oh_comma_ I remember those days.
Are you going to punish them for it?
What did you do?
I have had that happen a few times.
Why is he 2 now?
It won't last much longer.  Before you know it he will be grown up and married.
By yourself?
Well you should enjoy it
That sounds nice.  What did you get?
That is terrible.  I am so sorry
I wish my family lived close. You are lucky
We see each other once a year.
How so? Just used to the way things are?
Oh no_comma_ are there things you could do outside of your comfort zone? Things you never considered before?
That's awesome.
That's great. I hope she likes the new position.
Why are you so nervous?
Okay_comma_ I totally understand your feelings.
That's great. What is he doing now?
That's even more awesome. I hope he does well.
I do that a lot. 
Aint that the truth!
thats cool that you have one every year.
That could be fun!
That's great. I've never gotten a bonuse at work.
I just went on a vaction with my kids. Its was so relaxing. Have fun
Are you tired?
I understand. Taking some rest is important.
Did you get caught?
Don't feel too bad.  Its not like the government gives you money once a year.
Oh no_comma_ is there a storm approaching?
That is a very good idea.
I'm sure they're not - what makes you think that?
Perhaps next time the bill arrives_comma_ say something like_comma_ "ok_comma_ so that's $25 each" and take out $25 and put it on the table. They may take the hint.
Congrats! That is great!
That is definitely  something to be proud of.
What happened?
Sometimes when kids are young they don't get the importance of school
That can be nerve wrecking.
Do you think you did well?
How far are you going?  What school?
Way cool!  Congratulations!  Should be a great experience
I hope you get a good grade. Were you well prepared?
So_comma_ you don't have to worry about it.
Aw_comma_ that's so sad_comma_ I hope you had fun though
At least you had fun_comma_ too bad the friend missed out_comma_ their loss
Oh cool!  How pregnant are you?
Ohhhh so you already had her!  Congratulations!
That would be annoying.  How about meeting up with a friend or something?
I’m sorry. What are you going to do?
I like being emotional
I bet.  Its probably cheaper than therapy though!
What did you do?
Lol. I've done that before.
Sometimes we don't have it. God knows.
I would imagine so.  It is difficult to be away from family for long.
That would probably do the trick.  If not_comma_ video call your family to touch base more often?
Thats awesome.  Where are you wanting to go?
I live near Disney.. have you ever been?
That can be stressful. Is she ok?
I’m so sorry to hear that. 
Wow_comma_ that rocks!
I love winning things.  It just makes the whole day perfect_comma_ lol.
That's kind of you
I bet she really appreciates you
When does it come out?
What is it about?
Wow_comma_ that sucks.
That's kind of you to help her through hard times!
I am sure you will do great.
Good luck!
Lol. Are you embarrased?
I don't like that either.
What did you do?
That's no good.  Did you get anything good with it?
That is something to be grateful for.
MY boyfriend once said if he ever had to be in a wheelchair he wanted me to kill him. I broke up with him
How old are they?
It's always nice to have a balance in life
I bet you are apprehensive.
They sound very selfish trying to blackmail you like that. I would tell the teachers or professors asap
I am very content with having no car.
That can be very unhealthy for you but it's so convenient
Yeah that stuff is addicting
I love Tom Hardy!
He is. And he is nice to look at too lol
What is the dish?
Maybe she can help you and guide you step by step
Oh no! 
You had better sleep with one eye open
Me too_comma_ I like to see them as inspiration
If you work hard enough maybe you can afford in the future!
What is the class?
Economics is pretty cool
Are you a guy too? I bet you were envious of his looks and age hahah
Nice_comma_ I bet it was super fast!
I hate them too. I havent been on one in ten years.
I would be fine if I never rode one ever again
That's terrible. Won't the bank help you out?
I'm sorry. That really sucks
Are guitars expensive?
Does she want an acoustic or electric one?
What shows are you referring to?
I'll need to check that out!
That's terrible. Will you be able to get it back?
Well at least you will get it back though.
how long were u together
well then maybe you're better off lol
Nice_comma_ is it expensive?
I bet you are so proud of yourself! I need to learn how to be self reliant like you!
Congratulations! What's the job?
Oooohhh Fancy! lol
That's nice of you_comma_ do you usually let her go out?
My parents usually did that do. If I don't do the chores around the house_comma_ I don't get to head out
Lol. That sucks
That has happened to me once or twice.
Dang_comma_ that sucks. Did you find another class that is open?
I hate it when that happens.
Good luck. What is the class?
Lol. Good luck anyway
That is terrible.  What can you do?
I am sure they will work with you.  Don't stress out.
Aww. That's nice. Did you dosomething special?
I wish my parents would get my kids. They are too busy having fun themselves lol
Oh no_comma_ do you know what's wrong? I hate car problems..
Last time my car had problems_comma_ I had to spend so much money. It was awful.
You should definitely first talk to your friend and clear out the concerns with him before talking to his partner
As I said_comma_ first ask your friend why is he behaving in such an unacceptable way
Are you going to tell me?
You're not the only one. I am afraid of complete silence. I think I'm about to be murdered.
Im almost afraid to ask
hahaha I am so not one of those people.  I am too old for the technology!
I know right. I was just talking about that with my friends.
tell who what?
It's okay. You'll get through it_comma_ And yes you should tell her lol
I hope it didn't rain
Good thing nothing bad happen! I would be so devastated if my phone got stolen like that!
That sounds awesome!  What are you going to do?
That is sweet!
What part is that?
Is it the lead role?
LOL.. You crack me up.  
What kinda gun do you have?
Yay! What made you very happy?
Oh yeah!!! I need to get my ass to a legal state to get my card too!
That is no good.  What are they doing?
That is annoying.  Have you thought about talking to them?
4
7
What are they pictures of?
Those were the best! weren't they?
THat sounds bad.  Are you alright?
It sounds like you need soe distance from them
Are you a helicopter parent?  Do you spin?
Maybe you have went so long without hanging with your friends you forgot you had them.
OH. That's terrible. 
What is DiGiorno?
Did you give them a home?
Well that's nice. Every one deserves to be in a safe and loving home.
Would you like me to take them? :) I like kids_comma_ sometimes! I totally understand needing a break
Ah!!! Nice lol Summer went by so fast! Summer for parents now
That is awesome.  I love gambling.  Was it a scratch off?  Pick 3?
Its awesome... you can win 50-100 often on a 5$ scratch off..
Cool_comma_ where are you heading to?
Oh wow! I always thought kangaroos were really interesting animals!
That sounds like fun! What kind of park is it?
Great! Make sure to pack sunscreen. Hot here where I am
That sounds terrible.  What can you do?
I definitely agree you need to set up the boundaries.  Make sure you keep that up for the sake of everyone involved.
I had to buy a fruit fly trap this summer as well.  But as soon as I set it up they stopped flying around.
I feel your pain.. I really do!
Oh lord_comma_ I hate the vets! What happened?
Oh man! You know some meds can cause that. Look in too Similasan. They have one that prevents cataracts etc. Expensive ingredients but some are the some from people and dog meds for cataracts/dry eye etc.
That sounds great.  What do they like to do in the yard?
THat is so sweet.  I hope the weather stays nice
Going for a road trip?
Awesome_comma_ sounds like fun! I hope you have a safe trip.
Aww_comma_ how cute. Do you miss playing with your cat?
It's alright. Your cat is somewhere up in heaven.
What are you going to school for? Online or in person?
Oh that is tough! Oh man_comma_ especially at an alternative one. Make sure you do a lot of self care and don't take stuff too personally from kids :)
What did that do.. 
I am sorry that someone did that to you..
I know how you feel. I hate lairs.
But you have to do it otherwise you wont be able to trust her.
That's unfortunate.  Especially when there's nothing you can do to stop it.
It can be a vicious cycle. I've seen it before.
Oh man! Are they car keys as well?
Oh my god! Well please get ALL your locks changed. The car will be more difficult however hopefully they have no idea where you live so you should be ok.
Oh god! How did you get in finally_comma_ did you contact your mom?
That is very difficult. I wish you will find a solution.
I understand. Take it easy.
What are you studying?
Oh great! That has a lot of jobs. I hope you did well!
Tell me about it! I think about getting off as soon as I walk in!
Yeah. A job is better than no job_comma_ I suppose.
That is no good.  I bet he regrets it!
I hope so that is frustrating. 
Aww_comma_ that is so sad to hear. I'm glad that she has a good home now_comma_ though!
That's amazing! I wish more people were willing to do what you're doing to help out our furry friends!
What are the pros of switching jobs?
Well actually desk jobs are much harder on my body and can be really bad for your back and hips etc_comma_ if it's a desk job? Well if you are getting older you might want to start saving up_comma_ have a side hustle and maybe think about it? Less pay but more peace_comma_ health and time is always worth it :)
I also have a dog that was starved when she was young! She is so afraid of everything even to this day_comma_ but she's almost 8!
What breed of dog is she and how old? That's so awesome! Dogs are so resilient and it can teach us a lot about how we should live our own lives.
Awesome! Mine is also a pitbull mix! I call her my little bunny in pitbull form! They are the best dogs ever.
OHH! I Love chickens ! I have always wanted some. I have a duck! lol- What kind of chickens are they?
Oh man! They fight sometimes. I hope they aren't too bad about waking you up in the morning. Chickens can be very sweet though!
Maybe you should be straight with him?  That’s the only thing that will make it good in my opinion. 
I know the type.  There are better people out there that you just have to be patient for. 
Were you all best friends as children?
Oh geez_comma_ that's hard! I am glad you get to see them again. treasure such moments!
Now that's dedication!
Keep it up. One day you might appear in a fitness magazine. 
I love that when that happens! What is it for?
Love that! Glad you found it
Yeah_comma_ dogs have to learn how to play.  Kinda funny you don't always consider that.
It depends on how young they are.  I have a rescue that was abused but she was real young.  She snapped out of it.
I'm great how are you doing?
What's wrong?
thats great to hear _comma_ getting along better with the other students ?
Thats awful _comma_ i hate bullying have you told the principle ?
what did they advice _comma_ any martial arts schools around your area_comma_ maybe start your kid in it
Do you know who sent them?
Awesome_comma_ was there any special occasion?
I bet that was fun to look through
That would be cool.  Are you going to keep them?
i hope that you did well on them
thats great
I can't stand people who treat animals horribly.
I hope you call the cops on them_comma_ so they can go to jail for animal abuse.
I understand. Did you catch some of them in action?
That is bad. I would have the same feeling if I was in your situation.
I hear you! How old are you? As we get older_comma_ all kinds of stuff doesn't work the same
Try keto and fasting_comma_ or find a diet like RAW and you will be amazed at your energy and strength again!
Some people have incredible energy and drive! 
True! Often managers do not deserve that role. I am glad he does!
Oh my god_comma_ I HATE when people do that! That stuff can land on someone's windshield!
Wow_comma_ that's horrible! I would have been so pissed.
Oh my goodness! Why did he move away?
Are you all still together? Long distance can be hard but honestly absence makes you love them even more!
How come you can sit also?
That’s too bad
That is nice. Babysitting kids is sometime nice.
How old are they?
That is terrible.  How do they get away with it?
I am sorry you have to deal with that
That is always good! Errands can be a pain!
I am glad you got some things done! Now you can rest
I guess I never  thought about weather or not car insurance covers your own injuries too
Yeah they're really expensive. 
It's been a mix of a rollercoaster lol.
Wow! Are you going to stay now?
I understand! I would be too! 
That is great_comma_ what was wrong with the dog_comma_ how was it abused 
That is absolutely awful to hear_comma_ poor dogs don not deserve to be mistreated in such ways _comma_ im happy the dogs better 
Me also when I was young.
I understand
That is disappointing. I am sorry
Have you tried talking to them?
I hate bullies_comma_ but they usually get what's coming to them.
I know how you feel. Sometimes you just have to show them the error of their ways. If not karma will catch up with them.
That is incredibly kind of you_comma_ I hope he is a good driver :)
You are a great friend! We all need help at some point
Oh wow! I'd be afraid to go outside! I hope you are able to stay safe!
That sounds very scary. Ever thought of moving?
I wish you luck! I really hope you can get out of there soon.
I hear you! Have you thought about starting a side business?
great! there are SO many opportunities out there with the internet
That is very nice of him to welcome that poor dog
That is really cool.  good on you for welcoming them
Payday is fantastic! What kind of clothes did you buy?
Do you ever use poshmark or mercari? Those are good for deals. Sounds like you got some nice stuff! Payday is always a fun day
I SO HEAR YOU! lol! Being grown up has it's perks but it's not as great as we thought it would be with all the responsibilities. We ARE the mom and dad now ha
i freakin  hate that_comma_ like dude be sad or mad on your own dont take it out on your family_comma_ friends _comma_ or co workers 
Exactly great minds think alike _comma_ that is always so annoying as hell 
That is good to hear! Are there any issues?
Oh lord :( I have a partner doing the same thing and he feels more like a son a lot. That must be so hard. Being a parent is the HARDESt job ever. I am so very sorry. I hope he snaps out of it soon.
How come you were worried about it?
It sounds like it might be time to consider moving on without them
Things were much simpler when we were kids. You are your brother must have a close relationship.
I'm sorry to hear that. I guess it makes the times you do see each other even more special!
Oh no!  Was anyone around?
That is no good. I bet that was embarrassing. 
That's disgusting. Did you move to another table?
That's awful.  Some people are disgusting.
I am sorry to hear that. How are you feeling now?
I understand. It is tough.
Wow_comma_ that doesn't happen very often. Well done. Those things are normally quite expensive_comma_ aren't they?
Me too. Clearance is the first place I head for in the store! It must be so difficult to be gluten intolerant - seems as if there's gluten in everything these days.
Something I found which helped me lots was to eat e.g. bread made from organic wheat. So long as I don't overindulge I'm fine - fingers crossed.
Boy_comma_ you are having a tough time. Someone suggested buying imported pasta from Italy as the wheat doesn't have the same pesticides sprayed on it as us wheat. Dunno if it works tho'.
How long has it been?
Whoa! SO needed! What did you guys do?
I am sorry that you had to go through that.  
That is too bad.  It sounds like you need some knew people to surround you
You were suppose to start the conversation with a situation based on the context chosen.
I hope the hit will not be rejected.
im sorry to hear that_comma_ i was born with a lot of anxiety so i can somewhat relate
I honestly started taking cbd oil by charlottes web_comma_ and my anxiety went away after a few days of using it 
OH! That is the best isn't it? What will you do with it?
Oh awesome! It's always nice to have those little surprises in life.
What good thing are you waiting for_comma_ exactly?
I'm sure you'll find someone. 
It is good to maintain that contact with people
That is ok sometimes but getting out is important for you too
Oh yes_comma_ what is the temperature where you are?
OH! I love around 70! That is perfect. Oh it's over 80 here_comma_ getting a little hot but it will  be nice when it's night time :) Nothing like a good  summer to lift the spirits
That is awesome!  Congratulations!  So_comma_ you are prepared for everything that is about to happen?
It sure sounds like you have done everything you can to make the day special!
Did you tell his parents?
That must of been no fun_comma_ hopefully he won't do it again.
I know_comma_ Christmas was the best when we were children. Now that were adults it's not as exciting.
Yeah_comma_ I used to love waking up in the morning and run downstairs to open my presents.
What is going on?  Have you seen the dr?
I am so sorry you have to worry about that 
That is nice. Are you planning activities to do with them?
That is great
which country?
thats cool i bet she will have fun
That is really a bummer. Have you looked online for it somewhere else?
That’s no good. 
That's awesome. How come you guys didn't get to see each other often before?
Was it for work_comma_ school_comma_ etc?
Why did she leave?
Does she have another job already?
Wow that must have been embarrassing. 
That is so true!
That sounds really nice! Does it just look better or is travel better?
That will make getting exercise during or after work a lot easier.
That is a very nice person. You are lucky.
I lost my wallet once but didn't find money in it when it was returned to me.
Old photos can be so nostalgic. Do you have a favorite memory?
Adult life can definitely be difficult_comma_ but we get a lot of freedom now though.
That's amazing! What are you studying?
what kind of job are you hoping to get?
That sounds amazing!
It's pretty early to have Christmas planned already. I should get on that as well.
When will you find out?
Hopefully you win_comma_ what is the prize?
i used to be_comma_ not quite as much anymore
yes my friends play it
Oh me too. Have you ever messed with them?
That is great!
Where are you going boating?
What do you like to do on the lake?
thats crazy! was he ok?
thats great.  i love kids
Thats unfortunate
Was it for a contest or a class?
Oh no_comma_ must be disappointing. Are you putting off making it now or will you go in search for the missing mustard?
Will it taste the same?
Do you like museums?
Same here. Neither do I_comma_ but there are impressive museums out there that kinda make you change your stance.
I love going to Costco.
I always get rice and steak there.
Oh_comma_ cool!  What kind of turtle was it?
It sounds like it may have been a box turtle.  They are good as pets!
Maybe you can have them get you on one of the kiddie ones first?
Hope you have fun!
I always worry about that too. Is it early in the morning?
Will you be able to leave a little bit earlier to allow time for any traffic delays?
Are you in your basement?
That is smart_comma_ hopefully thou it doesn't happen.
thats unfortunate_comma_ sucks missing out on time with your family
you definitely gotta appreciate them while you can
That's really nice.   Sometimes things work out ok.
Did you just forget your wallet or did you not have any money at all?
lol a trap for what?
I guess you're not at all attracted to her then?
Aww_comma_ I just had to put my dog down last month.
It was very sad and I am sorry you had to go through that_comma_
That was very nice of him.
How long have you known him?
Oh_comma_ are you guys distant?
I'm glad you guys can start to come together again.
Oh no_comma_ why didn't they?
I guess you might have to reconsider this friendship.
When is the competition?
What is the grand prize?
i love taking trips_comma_ where was your favorite place to go'?
ive been there several times but its not my favorite place
That was nice of him_comma_ did you put gas in it?
Did you drive it fast?
Oh god_comma_ why did he do that?
Bad situations make you things you wouldn't normally sometimes. Did you talk to him about it?
Oh my! Were you okay?
Yeah that would be a little embarrassing I am sure. 
That's sad. is she going to get another one?
That's good. Its important for the elderly to have some company.
thats great its always good to plan ahead
im the same way
If you love the house. go for it.
You need to do some prosmection and you will find the rate interest that you want.
We've all done stupid things. I'm sure they'll let it go eventually.
You'll know for next time now. I know you must feel really bad.
Uh oh!  What happens if you can't get an earlier flight?  Will you miss the wedding?
I would be feeling quite anxious if I were you!  I am sure it will work out for you!
That sounds terrifying! Are you okay now?
Makes you appreciate life more_comma_ doesn't it.
I love Korean barbeque.
Is it open 24 hours a day?
I'm so sorry to hear that. How long ago was this?
it's terrible to lose someone. Was this expected or sudden?
have you swam before?
just gotta be careful where you swim
That was a wonderful surprise I am sure.
Oh wow! What a blessing!
Oh my gosh! I'm so sorry to hear that.
I know that's gonna to be a terrible loss for the family. 
Did it ruin the laptop?
Are you going to buy him a new one?
Was it your first race?
That must really disappointing. Will you race again?
where has he been?
thats cool. what does he do for a living?
Are you going to take one?
Yikes that's a little crazy.   Are they cat collectors?
Is it gonna turn out bad without it?
That's a relief then! Hope it's still delicious!
thats really awesome!
im really glad to hear it got worked out
Those little guys are quite nimble!  Did is surprise you?
Yeah_comma_ I guess they need to be agile to escape all the neighborhood cats!
That sounds awful! Did they give an explanation?
You must be disappointed. I'm sorry.
What are your thoughts on that?
I'm inclined to agree with you.  That's kinda strange.  The guy's ok with it? 
How was it?
Must've been really nostalgic. Did you guys catch up on your lives now?
what kind of cake do you like?
haha me too_comma_ never met a cake i didn't like.
Going to a new restaurant is always fun!  I am sure it will be great if there are a bunch of positive reviews!
Yummmy!  That sounds amazing!  I am sure you will have fun!
It's nice to know the time your spent studying paid off! Congrats!
Better to be over prepared than under.
maybe they went to see a movie?
can you call them on their cell?
Thats exciting.  How did that go?
That's almost a little strange.  Do you still have any interest in her?
What dish are you trying out?
Oh now you're just making me hungry!
Boo!  Did it make you mad?  I would have been!
Rightly so!  Nothing worse than expecting something and then it not being there!
Must be really lonely. You're not trying to go on a guys' night out or anything?
That's really sweet! Maybe they miss you_comma_ too.
That sounds so relaxing! What kind of dog do you have.
Dogs are a good source of entertainment.
that is interesting.  did you ever date?
oh yes that's true.  i thought you might have dated later in life. 
That's prett cool. Has she shown you?
Oh so you're both hunters!
Some habits die hard.  My mom's always trying to send me food still.. I'm a grown man.
I know_comma_ right.  Its kind of annoying but_comma_ also kind of nice.
wow_comma_ where did ya'll live at the time.
So you guys never did visits or anything?
Oh no. What happened?
Must feel terrible. Well_comma_ at least_comma_ you don't have to look after them then.
I love dogs! what kind?
mutts are the most loveable.
That sounds like a good night.  what movie?
hachi.  best dog movie ever.
That sounds exciting.  How long will you be staying?
That's cool. Do you have everything planned out?
Sounds nice. What's the temperature where you are?
I think I wouldn't go outside in close to 100 degree weather. That's crazy.
That's great! I wish more people would garden_comma_ so much healthier to grow your own food.
That's fabulous.  Love it when the older generation teaches the younger ones.
That's awesome! You must be feeling more alive and well
It's amazing how reaching those kinds of health goals brings things that you would have never even imagined before going through with it
Right_comma_ you always see the before and after pictures of other people but as you're doing it_comma_ it seems to take forever
Yeah_comma_ a lot of the times it would just come back as fast as it got lost
Insurance companies suck.  I hate dealing with them.
They're trying to not pay if they don't have too.    more $ in their bank.
That is awesome!  I would love to get something like that from a relative!  Does it have any sentimental value?
That was so nice that your were chosen to get it and hopefully pass it on again!
Wow! 6th grade_comma_ that's amazing. Are you planning on celebrating?
Fun! He must be really passionate about learning 
That's really special_comma_ and a great attitude to have
Looks like the future is bright for him
What's wellington?
Cool_comma_ where do you get your venison from?
Anymore? Are they ever safe??
What made hers unsafe?
Cool_comma_ you guys can race and whoever loses gets a new one
Good_comma_ How long haven't you talk to each other?
Wow_comma_ she is a little weird.
I bet that feels good
It definitely does.  You shouldn't have to stress about your job
It sounds like you have a lot of animals!
For sure_comma_ they can teach us a lot
That is very considerate of you. What are your duties as class mom?
Ah_comma_ I miss naps. If only I could go back to Kindergarten.
Those are so gross.
Did you put the cat in time out?
Oh cool.  You got it then?
Oh no!  Are you alright?
Oh I bet! How long has it been?
That will be a very nice reunion.
I miss mine too. Where did you guys grow up?
Canada is such a beautiful country. Was there a lot of things to do there for you kids?
Nice. Good luck with that. You are interviewing for which position?
Wow. Good luck. I hope you get the position.
That sounds relaxing
What game did you play?
It is a great feeling when we can say that. My 37th child just became self-sufficient last year as well!
I know! I think my wife is calling it quits after the 38th_comma_ though.
Sorry to hear!  What all did you order?  And what was wrong with it?
Cold fries are the *worst* b/c the potatoes are just gross at that point.  Did you get your money back_comma_ at least?
Oh bless your heart!  I'm sorry to hear!  I'd have returned it and gotten the whole meal free for the cold messed up fries!
That's good! Hopefully you'll be compensated in some way for the fries.  Ugh_comma_ cold fries!  You're way nicer about it than I would have been.
Nice. What did you buy?
Ah_comma_ a must in a household of rugrats.
Are you mad at them?
Oh my word! I thought bobcats were mythical like unicorns.
wow. was it expensive?
That's crazy!
Awesome!  Are you excited to go?
You sound prepared!  I am sure you will make a good impression on the other party goers!
Oh wow!  You were pretty angry
I guess you are right
Neat! Where are you going?
Sweet! What are you going to be doing there? Always wanted to take a journey to the South.
Oh. wow. Did you cry?
Your kid should be on America's got Talent! unless you're not in america.
What is your new job like?
That's pretty neat! I work in a Nike sweatshop in Siberia_comma_ so I really can't say the same!
Physics? That must be crazy hard.
Well good luck. I think you'll do well if you studied that hard.
All one? I prefer to be all two in my house.
Yeah_comma_ being alone a big ole house is often times more spooky than not. I almost got nabbed by a ghost the last time I was alone.
Ugh_comma_ that's the worst!  Bright side - at least you weren't far from home that you were able to clean everything up_comma_ right?
*blinks*  One_comma_ I didn't know possums travelled in herds and two_comma_ I am only hoping your day didn't get worse from there?
Bless it!  And you survived all of that to tell the tale!  And all of this over a busted garbage bag!  We gotta get you a better brand of garbage bags_comma_ friend.  :)
Good job!  How are you doing so far?
It is tough.  Don't be too hard on yourself.  Just do better moving forward
That's nice
That's so true. I was scared to put my kids in daycare
Wow! They are pretty lucky!
Yes that would be nice.
Awesome_comma_ a bird left the nest.  How old is he?
Awe a little sentimental? 
That wonderful!  Did he initiate it?
That’s great and a relief
I know the feeling
I definitely know that feeling lol
Are you still close?
That's sad. Have you reached out to her?
That's not bad. I only see people in my family once ever few years.
Oh wow! Congrats?  Boy or girl?
That is great that you are prepared!
It's always nice to have some good friends.
I do have a few really good ones. 
That sounds exciting!  Are you nervous about it?
It's not the easiest thing to do_comma_ and so very few states ask for it.  The state I come from requires it.  It's just something you use in so very few situations_comma_ I'm surprised they still test for it.
Sounds like a plan!  that's the only way you'll get better!
Are you scared or excited?
My first few years I went from the east coast to Colorado. It will be the best time of your life.
Enjoy it before you get old. Before you know it college will be over and you will be a slave to student loan payments.
I've been there.
That's sweet.
What kind of restaurant?
Man that is pretty crazy being that young even.
Me two. No bills and just relax and play.
Being stressed never helps. 
It could always be worse. People in the 3rd world are on the edge of death from having no food.
What happened?
It is ok. If the teacher was not angry_comma_ it should be fine.

We have cold winters but hardly ever any snow. I'm glad too
Did you follow him home and confront him?
Perhaps he thought the same about you?
How'd she do?  Did she get the right clothes?
Were the three things not in the dress code?
Yiiiiiiiiiiikes!  Long sleeves in the heat!  *cringes*  Times like these make me glad our schools went to uniforms!  But I understand about the heat - we're in short sleeved polos until November at the earliest.
Sounds like what kids would do!  But the bright side is_comma_ if you have two days worth of fall or winter_comma_ she's prepared!
Oh no_comma_ what was it?  Not too bad I hope.
That isn't half as bad as what I was thinking it might be.  Glad to hear it was just overindulging in food.  Oh well_comma_ you always have tomorrow to be better!
What did you do?
That is awesome. You should marry her again lol
That's awesome!  I know that took a lot of hard work!
That's the best way to go about it - make sure you have time for all the things you need time for.  That way you're not running around like a chicken with your head cut off.
Are you gonna try to keep that sort of balance going forward?
Are you going to eat them?
Give them to a homeless person.
That is great when that can happen but it doesn't always if one or both love a lot! I hope you remain friends.
I hope so too!
That is terrible.  Did you lose all the food that was in there or were you able to save it?
That is so terrible.  It would be nice if the refrigerator company had to replace all of your groceries if their product breaks!  Did you get a new one yet?
That's awesome. Congratulatios
Just hope for a happy healthy baby!
Congratulations. Yes it can be very hard to get pregnant and carry children for some. I know how that goes
I do but both are in heaven. But they are still my children..doctors/midwive mistakes on me (in a lawsuit) and so it affected the second one. Not trying again until I can go to a specialized doctor and get in perfect health.
Be very careful. It was just an untreated UTI in me and then they wouldn't help me when I had HELLP syndrome for awhile..I went to a few doctors too..none were good-and I was full term..I almost bled out..The littlest things sometimes can really hurt you and your baby. I am so sorry! I am so glad you had 1_comma_ take good care of yourself and follow your gut :)
Oh_comma_ how adorable! There are so many bunnies around right now.  My parents house has especially a lot of them and they don't really run off like normal either.
That is so precious.  I have never seen that before.  Baby bunnies are the best!  I've had 3 bunnies/rabbits in my lifetime and they were great pets.  What are your bunnies' names?
lol_comma_ oh no!  My albino rabbit I had when I was younger was like that....skittish beyond belief!  Those are adorable names!
Not to me!  Some part of me is anxious to be holding a grandchild_comma_ and then when they poop or get fussy_comma_ to hand them riiiiiiight back to their parents!
On the one hand I miss them because there's nothing in the world like baby smell.  On the other_comma_ the best day of my life so far was when my youngest was potty-trained!
A.ww that must have been so cute
I've never seen a bunny. That;s weird
Oh no! That is a hard thing to think about. You might want to take some time apart and find it out to be fair to him
Well think about what qualities he has- There are so many dishonest people out there and abusive people. Sometimes we don't connect with someone good..but will regret it later. Definitely think on it as you'd never want to lose a good trustworthy person even if you just keep them as a friend
Is that a good or a bad thing?
Aw_comma_ I am sorry_comma_ they will be back soon though?
Never bad_comma_ good mom or dad :) They are only young once
That makes me mad too
People let things get out of hand and it is so unecessary.
Uh oh! Was everything ruined?
Oh how disappointing. 
That must feel awesome
I feel that way when my kids are gone
I swear_comma_ the DMV is the *worst*!
Yeah_comma_ but the state would never get out of debt if they had to pay the people for missing work just to wait in inefficient lines at the DMV.
That's understandable. What happened?
That's hard. Are they in a new relationship? I hope it wasn't a bad breakup?
That's hard! If he was bad to you_comma_ I hope you are able to get over it_comma_ if not_comma_ you can always reach out :)
that sucks
you have to let those people go
Lol. That's gross
I wouldn't either. She should find another job lol
That's no good. How did that happen?
Dang. Well I bet that really worked to get your point across haha
Oh_comma_ wow.  That's a long time.  How old were you when you first went in?
Ha ha.  Now I know you're kidding me.  50 years?  I think you served your time for that offense_comma_ wiouldn't you say?
South Carolina is really nice. What are you planning on doing there?
Sounds like a grand ole time. Everyone likes the good ole carriage ride every now and again.
Did you get a call back?
We believe it and you just might
Oh darn that is stressful I bet.
That's no good. How does that happen?
I happy you're not being abused either.
Some people make it to the other side. I'm glad ou did.
I hear you :) I do the same
I know right? I am working on a side business so I can do that one day. You should totally get a side hustle.
I understand! What are you going to school for?
I bet_comma_ it can help people and pay a lot in a career as well. Good luck!
Ouch_comma_ sounds like you really like working out with your friends.
I'm no doctor_comma_ but it sounds like you might need even more to balance things out.
After being married for that long_comma_ I really don't blame you. Do you want to move on and find someone else?
Well_comma_ if that's how you feel then maybe it is best if you stay in the dugout and don't play the field. No shame in that.
Did she get into any trouble?
Well that was very nice of her. Did you give her anything in return?
Did she get a cute bandaid?
That's sweet. You should've took a picture and framed it so you guys can cherish that moment forever
I hear ya there.  When did you lose her
That is exactly how I would describe my grandma.  YOu are lucky to have had her
That is very nice to friendly neighboors.
Yes_comma_ Now days_comma_ most neighbors don't talk to each other.
Congratulations!  I'm sure everything is going to turn out well.  You probably have to see your doctor more than usual to make sure everything is okay.
That's definitely a good sign!
That sucks. Why did he/she do that?
Yeah_comma_ ignorance in youthfulness is sometimes a good thing. That's really terrible of your ex_comma_ though. He should be burned at the stake.
I used to think that too. I could sleep if it wasn't closed all the way
And you could have caught him in the closet!!!
Oh wow!  Did the guy get caught?
That would be.  I am so sorry you had to go through that.
That sounds like you have some good help now. How old are they?
Its good that they are thoughtful_comma_ sound like very well mannered kids!!!
What position do you play?
Are you taking some orange slices to spice things up?
What was holding you back?
If you could do it all over again_comma_ how would you overcome _comma_ and pardon me for saying this_comma_ your wimpy-ness?
That is awesome.  Did you find out what it was for?
That is great
That sounds like a jolly good time_comma_ ole chap. What shows/movies are you planning on watching?
Nice. The Office is one of my favorite shows. I do enjoy Steve Carrell's character.
Awwwww!  You guys are doing the right thing.  How is it doing today?
That's fair enough.  I wouldn't know what to do with a hurt bird.
That is bad. Did you already made reservation and purchase airline tickets?
Good. There was no else that could replace the person sick?
Wow. I bet that was a nice surprise. Did you get a lot of presents? 
Sounds great. You are lucky to have such thoughtful coworkers. 
Oh wow that is disgusting
What are you going to do?
Where do you guys work?
That's pretty neat. I imagine is very nice working from home. I wish I could so that I can stop working at the Nike sweatshop.
That's a bummer. Did you get it repaired?
Well_comma_ that's good. At least everything turned out okay in the end.
Oh wow_comma_ I bet that made you smile
That is very awesome
That sounds like a lot of fun. Did you ride a lot of rides?
Did you ride any that made you sick? Some of the ones that go upside down always make me sick. haha.
I bet you were proud
I am sure they learned from you
I am as well. Even if it is a simple thatched roof.
Indeed. The world can use a lot less people.
How come it felt bad?
That is terrible.  WHy?
Yes_comma_ thats always a good thing. Have you been working long?
Wow. I bet you are grateful to be working. Being jobless is a horrible place to be. 
That is no good. How is she doing now?
That is great to hear
That is horrible!  I would've been too.  That actually happened to me but thankfully it was an old account that I didn't use.  Did they take money from you?
I just think that's the worst way for the IRS to do things though. Life is hard and once you have debt from any numbers of things_comma_ it can be hard to climb back out of the red.  I'm so sorry you had that shock and I hope they work with you on payments.  
He'll have a great time_comma_ though.  He'll make tons of friends and his days will be full of joy!  You will need some hobbies though.
With all the extra time you have you should start a counseling service.  I know your mom would use you!
Did you have fun
I do love getting gifts
That's awesome. Are you and your aunt close?
That's cool man. I'm really not close to any of my relatives.
Im sorry to hear that. What made you scared?
Wow! I bet that is scary. Good to know you made it okay. 
what did you do?
what did they advise you to do?
Awesome.  Are you nervous?
You definitely will
That's really neat. Did you guys have an easter egg hunt?
That's cool. Who collected the most eggs?
I understand.
What band was it?
You need to speak up next time
Good_comma_ thats what needed to happen
How come you were afraid?
I can understand that
goodluck!
yea i think we have all been there
I am sorry_comma_ I am sure he will be safe
I am sure you are
Four is a pretty cool number. I am a bigger fan of 5_comma_ though.
What was wrong with your Dad?
Oh no. I'm so sorry.  I feel you.  I lost my sweet springer spaniel_comma_ Pepper_comma_ not long ago. Are you coping okay?
Well_comma_ that's a wonderful thing.  You had a good time with the first one and this new one will breathe life into your day and pull any sadness away.  What will you name it?
It's nice to have someone that is helpful around the house.  Does he work_comma_ too?
Well that is too bad.  Maybe there is some way you can motivate him to work harder.
why is that
i hope it turns out well for you!
It is.  What are you referring to?
of course you were
Wow. How did you manage to eat that many? Maybe you should have shared. 
You should enter a eating contest. Sounds like you could win. 
That sucks. How does that make you feel?
Yeah_comma_ that's how it was with my younger brother too. He always go his way.
That’s no good. Why?
That would scare me too
why is that
oh sorry to hear that
Dang_comma_ that sucks. When do you find out if you got the job?
I think you are overreacting. Just try to find your medicine and calm yourself down. I am sure you will get the job.
That sounds terrible! I'm sorry that happened to you. I hope everything is okay now. Do you know what caused it?
Eww.. Rotten eggs.. That's terrible. I know eggs are so healthy for you_comma_ but I never touch them partly because of how they smell when they're cooked/prepared in certain ways. Again_comma_ I'm sorry you had to deal with that. Was there anybody nice enough to help you when you were on the bus_comma_ or how did that end up?
That is pretty impressive
That is really something to be proud of
Why not just call him? Its not unheard of.
Maybe he is just busy right now. I wouldn't lose hope yet. 
That is a good news. Did he kept them with him for a long period of time?
That is nice.
That sucks. What sport?
You're not good at a single one of those? I was a strong swimmer when I was a kid.
i can understand that
the NICU thats wonderful
Oh fun!  What kind of dog does she have?  What's its name?
My mom had a husky named Heidi for almost 16 years.  They are beautiful dogs but boy can they run away fast if they get an opportunity.
Sometimes sibling rivalry dies hard -- even when you've well outgrown it. Are y'all far apart in age?
I love your heart. That's important. Are you a brother or a sister to them?
Please do. Sometimes it takes time to mature on an emotional level. It's cool that you have that on them :-)
Nice! Where did you meet your date?
That's really cool. Where is the date going to be at?
That is nasty. What are you going to do?
I am with you 
How did that feel?
that is awesome
That must be hard sometimes_comma_ but I guess also has its advantages. 
I bet. Maybe he will move closer to you soon. 
That's awesome.  What level of math is it?
I always had trouble with math so anything above counting is beyond what I feel competent in.  Good luck on the test!
That's really cool! What kind of memories resurfaced?
Oh_comma_ I am sorry for being so insensitive. I am sure your mother is in a better place.
Wow! What happened?  I hope everything is  okay.
What? Nothing too bad I guess...
did he get ma?
hellz yea.. all about number 1
That is terrible_comma_ my friend. How do you think it is going to affect your friendship>
I'm sure it won't be too bad. You just have to work hard and hopefully you'll get promoted next time.
Oh cool!  Do you play in the game or get to be the cooler part of the team_comma_ the waterboy?
Ha ha! Awesome!  I bet you're great at it!  Get out a hose and just water them down! Its faster.  Hope you have a great game tomorrow!  Don't forget the orange slices.
Why are you going to the court?
I understand. I hope things will go smoothly.
I can understand that
That is good.  You will feel better
That is horrible. Were you able to do anything about it.?
I am so sorry to hear that. I wish there was something more you could do.
Ir is almost all kid that do that. He will get used to it.
People can be bad some time. I hope it will be better.
what happened
well at least you made it through
oh yea im not surprised though.
yea after the finals_comma_ at least he didnt go to the GSW haha
What is your interview for?
That's pretty cool. Do you think you will get the job?
That sounds really peaceful
That is so good for the soul
I bet that brought back memories. Hopefully good ones. 
Wow_comma_ I bet that was a happy surprise. I love looking at old pictures. 
Are you alright?
I am sorry you have to deal with that. 
how did it go? congrats btw
hah .. it gets better
Why did your family leave? Sorry that you felt that way.
What did you do all by yourself?
Oh my god. Did you guys have a fight?
It's just an extra tomato_comma_ man. You're going to let that ruin your relationship with your turtle?
Oh yeah? What is going to be your hallmark meal?
Can't go wrong the sushi and steak special. A classic in Alaska.
That's too bad. Why were you all alone?
Interesting. Why wouldn't they take you along?
oh wow.. how are you feeling
thats good
It was the right thing to do. Getting used to not having someone around is going to take some time.
It will take time_comma_ but I'm sure you'll be okay.
What a monumental event!  I bet you're so excited.  What took her away for so long?
She sounds smart.  Are you nervous at all or just thrilled to be with her again?
Is the dog potty trained?
That pool noodle must be terrifying for her.
Did your cat show the bird who's boss?
That's somewhat offensive.
No I haven't. Is it good? 
Sounds interesting. I will have to check it out. 
I will. But I dont scare easily. 
That's so sad. I'm sorry
Have you ever tried writing? That's what I do
You're hosting a party? or attending one? Either way_comma_ social gatherings can always be a lot of pressure_comma_ so that's why I usually avoid them_comma_ unfortunately. What are some of your worries_comma_ if you don't mind me asking?
Oh_comma_ so you're hosting. Man_comma_ that's definitely hard. I really do feel for you_comma_ as I wouldn't have the courage to do that. Well_comma_ since you're worried about it_comma_ at least it shows you care. And you still have plenty of time to prepare! Do you have anyone that can help?
That is so sweet!
It is a good sign that she shows that kind of care to them
damn did you do it all alone or you had help? are you lebron james living in a mansion?
ah thats understandable 
I'm sorry to hear that! Did you find your dog?
Did you try calling your local shelter?
Oh no. You didn't have anyone to go with?
Wow. That's some friends you have there.
Did everyone end up contributing to the project?
I am sure they will. They have to if they want to get a good grade.
Tornados are terrifing. Are you ok?
That's good to hear. Glad you're ok.
Lectures can be boring
I do miss some of my class
where you going?
oh that sounds great. good luck
why did they say no?
Im so sorry.. I wish I could fix that for you.
That sounds like it could be fun_comma_ or was it sad?
Oh no! Well those aren't such good friends.
That is too bad. Why are you on the keto diet?
Yeah_comma_ that diet is somewhat expensive. Has it been hard sticking to it?
History is a lot of memorizing. Glad you did well.
How were the rest of your exams?
Oh well_comma_ there is always next weekend
I am sure you will find something
Oh lord_comma_ that made me almost vomit! I choke easy too_comma_ I am sorry!
Not your fault at all! Somethings can't be helped.
Oh I know that feeling. What are some of the things that you can eat?
It has to be tough to not know what to eat. I hope you'll get that allergy test soon to figure things out.
I do hate those too
I would not like that at all
Sounds nice.. where did you go?
Thats nice this time of year..
Aww_comma_ that's terrible but good she has you. I have had many family members that had that fight. 
It really is. I found being positive is key and you're probably more helpful than you realize. Even though you feel it's not exactly right_comma_ doesn't hurt to ask too. 
what did you do?
thats a good selection
I'm not familiar with basketball. Why would it be hard for him to leave?
I hope the lakers treats him well.
Thats exciting.  Do they know what they are having?
I just might  you never know these days!
Online classes takes some dedication versus going to class. Good for you!
You're very modest!
That is really good.  Starting off right is one of the most important things for a successful School year.  Where are you going?
I did attend college_comma_ but I am one of those statistics you hear about....a dropout.
I'm sorry to hear that. Sometimes kids don't know how to interact well with each other. But it's an important part of the socializing part of life that they work their way through it. All you can do is tell them how to respectfully and appropriately respond and defend themselves.
Ah.. so it's that kind of situation. Yeah_comma_ it can be one thing if it's just something where kids are acting like kids_comma_ and you can't physically intervene in time. But it's another if you think it's neglect and that they're not responding appropriately to the situation. I would trust your judgment. I hope everything ends well with it though! I'm sure you gave your child lots of love afterward.
It happens even when we study hard sometimes!
true! Life is full of learning_comma_ I am glad you have learned something from it_comma_ so many don't. Kudos!
I am sorry_comma_ was the cat okay
That does sound scary
Good for her. Never too late to go back to school.
Oh wow. She sounds like super woman!
I don't blame you. Those things are creepy
I got a clown for my daughters 4 birthday. Every single kids cried lol
I understand that_comma_ I am not either with some of my family! We are not always born in too families that are like us_comma_
I am sorry_comma_ are they very mean or abusive?
Well then it's no loss! Find family in others. That is no family!
Cat room? I've never heard of such a thing.
Did any of the cats get out?
Maybe you should get cameras
wow thats great
every few years.. and its enough!
Yeah_comma_ that's never something to complain about--well_comma_ unless you were fired_comma_ I guess_comma_ but that doesn't sound like that was the case! I'm happy for you_comma_ too. Did you do anything fun with your extra time?
Well_comma_ that was nice of you. I'm glad you got a chance to squeeze in more family time and didn't go spend it just sitting around or something. I hope that happens more often for you.
Fun!  Those can be addictive for me.  I only get them around Christmas time...not sure why but its a fun stocking stuffer.  Did you win?
I hope you win too!  Scratch them now and let me know if you win.  Now I'm excited for you! Hope you hit a big bank!
Oh wow.. are you going there to surprise her
well don't worry too much ... the food isnt the most important thing and I am sure it will at least be satisfactory.  Focus on the family
That is not good. So no way to get the info back
I am sorry_comma_ that sounds terrible
Does your dad still live nearby?
I am so sorry to hear that. His memory lives on though.
Oh gross! What restaurant?
I would blast them on social media. That is not good_comma_ especially for them not to take responsibility for it.
Yea. Floors get dirty pretty quickly with dust. Will you be replacing the vacuum?
I actually got a vacuum myself but made a bad decision. The thing does not suck well.
What breed is it?
I love boxers_comma_ and their cut off tails.
Wow. I hope it was a clean diaper.
Who knew a diaper would be so terrifying.
That sounds like so much fun.  I hope you have a good_comma_ relaxing time.  Where are you going?
I hope it's a better experience by the pier than mine.  hahahaha.
That's good. Are you getting the hang of it?
It's better to write things down than try to keep things in your head.
That sucks. What store is it?
We have a lot of those where I live.
Nice! Is this your first time having that done?
How come_comma_ what happened?
Oh geez! lol! Just watch tv online :) I do- that way always something I like_comma_ I can watch
I love cheesecake
Oh no! Was is plain or did it have sweet toppings too?
I wish I could make a cheescake.
What stores are you going to
News clothes are always nice
oh my gosh!  I am glad you are ok!!!
Where do you live?  Kansas?
Oh dogs are so sweet. Was it your first time?
he lived? Oh no. What happened?!
what did you do
good luck next time!
That's amazing_comma_ first child?
Cherish every moment_comma_ they grow up SO fast!
Isn't that the best feeling when something you really want is actually on deep discount_comma_ and you are just in the right place at the right time!
I am right there with you.  I hope this is a sign of a great week to come!
I'm glad they won!
Were the opposing team a really tough one?
Oh I bet you enjoyed that
I bet you will
I am sorry_comma_ why didn't he come?
I bet he hated missing it too! Work is good for bills but it interferes a lot with life
That is not good. I am glad they are okay though
I would be too
You seem a bit jealous.
You should talk to your friend about it. 
How precious!  How old is she now?  What does the ornament look like?
What a wonderful nostalgic piece.  My daughter is 8 and growing up way too fast.  I have a hand print ornament she made and I can't believe one day she'll be 13!
That's awesome. What subject was it?
History is one my favorites as well!
Thats bad timing for sure
Well at least they got out
You are a good parent.  How do you have space for it all?
I guess you'll have to get a storage unit.  The question then is what goes in the storage unit?  Furniture or the kids crafts.  Haha.
Thats always a plus
That happens to me too. I go to the store almost every day
Does he live far away?
That makes sense. Did you have fun?
What movie is it
Well as long as they love it
That sounds amazing!   What do you have planned?
That sounds great!
That's so neat when friendships last so long.
I am sure you guys have a great bond and many fun memories.
No one came to take care of you?
Was the cat nice? I know they can be sassy when they don't get all of the attention lol
Healthy is important
I guess_comma_ but they can always teach them
Oh wow_comma_ you must have been thrilled!
That's great when someone you love puts in the extra effort to be there for you
Thats not good_comma_ I remember bad times at school. What happened?
One good friend who you can trust is better than a bunch you can't. It's just part of growing up sometimes. School can be an exercise in mental strength.
Yes_comma_ I hope she can find her self worth in who she is. It's just part of growing up. It's hard
What kind of birds are they?
Thats so sweet of you.
That can be one of the hardest parts of life. Very tough
How did it go? Is it college?
I am sorry_comma_ roommates can be annoying sometimes
I will not either
Ah! That's kind of a scary thought_comma_ but I bet that would also be kind of fun. I live in a city with a very extensive history that is utilized a lot in "haunted" trips and stuff like that_comma_ so I have seen them around and have wondered about going on one. Do you believe in ghosts?
Yeah_comma_ I can totally understand that. It can be exhilarating and a different experience_comma_ I would imagine. But I would understand that you wouldn't want to have to deal with the after effects. I never have trouble with nightmares_comma_ so I don't worry about that. As for me_comma_ I'm still on the fence about ghosts.
That's really too bad. I know how that feels. Have you tried telling her how you feel about it?
That must be really difficult and lonely for you. I hope you guys can get something figured out.
Sounds like a good kid. What has he been working on.
That's great! How old is he?
That is nice of you.  Where has he been?
that is really nice of you
Sometimes you gotta stand up for yourself.
If they know you_comma_ they should know better.
Talk about an unwelcome guest! I would have immediately slammed my door shut! I never know how to respond in those situations_comma_ as in whether or not they're dangerous_comma_ etc. What did you do?
I did not expect that kind of reaction! But I guess I don't know enough about possums. Maybe that makes sense. I compare them almost to raccoons_comma_ who I've seen be very aggressive. Well_comma_ it looks you made a new friend. I hope you named them!
You are so lucky!
I know exactly what you mean. Someone returned my purse at the casino once. It still had my money in it!
That must be incredibly annoying to have to deal with. To constantly have to battle for what you feel is justified support_comma_ and to always be worrying about it in the back of your head. You have to be really resilient to go through that.
Wow.. That's almost noble. I hope you're able to still properly survive without it_comma_ especially since it's unfair that you're not getting it in the first place. I'm sorry you're being put in that position. One day I'm sure your children will recognize and appreciate you had to go through for them.
Don't be too hard on yourself. You taught yourself a lesson for next time.
I'm in college I understand. Just have to keep pushing forward and you'll so great
Oh no.  I have experienced that before and its not pleasant.  Its hard to be kind and careful with your speech and actions when you're near a snob.
Seriously!  I just keep thinking that they are a person just like me and it doesn't always means they are better than me just because they are entitled.  As they say_comma_ everyone puts their pants on one leg at a time.
Ugh! So you have corrupt police officers in your town too? That is a bummer!
I would too! Most officers dont show up for that.
Your mom is awesome
Maybe you should go on a trip together
Oh yeah? That sounds awesome. That's how it should be! Can you tell me a little bit about them?
Haha_comma_ that's incredible. A lot of parents wouldn't feel that way... After 18_comma_ they're done. That's pretty cool of you to feel that way_comma_ but I guess that speaks volumes about the kind of kids you have and how good they are. It sounds like you raised them right.
Why is that?
I can understand that
I hops so too! Work does come first or the bills can't be paid! :)
What kind of birthday are you having?
Wow! Enjoy it! What did you accomplish if I may ask?
That is something that is a dream! Enjoy it so much! congrats
I am so sorry to hear that.  When will you see them again?
That is so sad to hear.  I hope things go well with the therapy and you are reunited soon.
There's absolutely nothing I can say to make you feel better about that. I'm sorry for your great losses. Just from those few sentences alone_comma_ I can tell you were very passionate about them. What were their names_comma_ if you don't mind me asking?
Those are great names! And that does sound like a good idea_comma_ as long as you're comfortable with it. It's such a tenuous situation.. to want another pet to fill the void_comma_ but to be scared that you will be disappointed when they don't live up to their predecessors. My girlfriend will be in the same situation when her dog passes. She's already getting nervous since her dog is 10-years-old.
Oh gross!  I've heard of flies or ants being in an ear_comma_ but a roach?  That gives me chills because I hate roaches sooooo much.  Now I might have nightmares tonight!
EW!  I might start sleeping with ear plugs in now too.  I've heard you eat 8 spiders on average in a lifetime_comma_ some in your sleep.  So many things to be scared of with bugs! I'm so glad they were able to get it out.  Tell her I hope she gets over the trauma of it okay.
Oh_comma_ how come?
Oh my god! I have done something similar before. I don't get embarrassed easy but I know such things do sting a bit!
That is terrible
Police here do that sometimes. It sucks.
I can imagine that. I've never lived alone before.
When did you start living by yourself?
That is great! Being without a job can be very scary
What kind of job is it?
Yu should report him
Well thats what I mean. I hate when people take advantage of others
Oh that could be tough sometimes. I'm glad you were able to get all the ones you wanted.
It's all behind you now.
My neighbors are terrible so I hope you have a good relationship
I actually had some move in a couple of days ago. I have figured them out yet lol
That is doing something. It's what we call relaxing.
Have you been busy lately?
That happens over time
I wonder what my old school looks like now
Oh no_comma_ what happened?
You should check if they raised your rates unexpectedly or maybe something you bought is eating up a lot of electricity.
That's terrible_comma_ what did you do?
I hope he learned his lesson.
How was it?
What did you order?
yes! Yin and yang_comma_ it's hard to appreciate the quiet without the loud :)
Remember to cherish them as we can all go at any minute :)
Oh_comma_ I love cleaning_comma_ so tools to do it with that are new are always welcomed. What kind of brand?
A Hoover seems like a reliable choice. My girlfriend is a neat freak_comma_ and decided to go with a big purchase_comma_ a Dyson_comma_ which is more expensive. I've used it and it's not bad. Still not sure I'd pay as much as she did for a vacuum cleaner_comma_ but who am I to argue. Anyway_comma_ I'm happy for you.
Woah! I'm soooo glad you're okay!  Those big rigs are so dangerous and make me so nervous.  I stay as far away from them as I can.
Well_comma_ that's understandable.  I've had two kids of my own and labor would not be fun in the car.  Was she in shock when you guys were almost hit?
I completely understand that.  Things are always scary when it is happening to your kids_comma_ but there is hope!  Have you ever heard of whole foods plant based diet?  Or doctor Fuhrman_comma_ or doctor Michael Greger?  I think it could heal your son!
You will likely never hear about any of this stuff in a doctors office_comma_ but it can heal almost anything!  I hope your son is better before the end of summer.  Keep hope alive!
What happened to it?
That sucks.
What are they doing?
Oh lol_comma_ Well it
Sorry! I meant that kids do that_comma_ enjoy it mom while they are little :)
I feel sorr for the poor guy!
Yea_comma_ they're his parents. I can imagine everyone being hesitant about telling them what not to do with their own child.
That's nice of you to say about someone else. It's nice when someone can recognize someone else's hard work and dedication without feeling jealous or annoyed. I'm sure he knows how proud of him you are.
That's a good way to look at it_comma_ to use them as motivation and a goal to strive for. Are you in school yourself_comma_ or just working?
Oops.  That's doesn't have to be a bad thing.  No one can resist fries from McDonalds.  How did she react?
Well_comma_ there you go.  She enjoyed it and if she didn't complain or scoff at you_comma_ then she sounds like a keeper!
You must really miss him! So glad you'll finally be reunited with him.
Oh you have kids_comma_ too? They're going to be so happy!
I've never done that before.
I bet its fun. I cant swim though
IT? Haven't heard of it. What's it about?
Are you thinking about telling her you don't want to see it?
That's a great idea!  For what cause though?
That is very thoughtful of you.
Oh no. That has happened to us so many times. I thought fidh were easy
Wow. Im sorry
People can be inconsiderate sometimes. I hope you don't get sick!
That's true. It's nice of you to put yourself in their shoes.
Oh man_comma_ Costco pizza is great_comma_ and so cheap_comma_ too. It may not be the best_comma_ but for the price and quantity_comma_ you can't really beat it. Do you like shopping at Costco often?
Yeah_comma_ I guess it depends on your household. I just tag along with my parents from time to time to get certain things in bulk. But I think you need to have a certain amount of people in your family for it to be worth the membership. Still_comma_ I really appreciate the business and the owner as a whole.
That was so nice of you.  What did they need to use it for?  Were you able to live without it?
What?!! That's terrible.  I don't understand how people don't take care of things that don't belong to them when its a privilege to use borrowed things.  
That is terrible. Some people ar just no good.
I hate that happened to you. I know the feeling too. Someone stole my car from the work parking lot once. I had just soent over 1500 getting things fixed on it.
Family conflict is always hard.  Maybe you don't need to take a side and try to work for peace.
It is rarely easy to know the right thing to do in these sorts of situations.  This might be a situation that calls for some professional help.
Whoa! Was that a good surprise_comma_ or a bad surprise? I could see that going either way_comma_ but at least it would be exciting! I had that happen when I got one for Christmas. Well_comma_ actually it was in my parent's bed_comma_ and I barged into their room to ask if we could go downstairs and open presents_comma_ and I saw the one they had gotten me and had been hiding to surprise me with.
That's pretty cool! I hope everything goes well with the training and raising of it. Your wife sounds really cool to do that for you.
Did you call her? I hope she's ok!
I'm glad you're going to talk about it instead of being passive aggressive about it.
Oh_comma_ that's kind of nice. It's nice to have those natural landmarks near where you live_comma_ so you can visit them and get a sense of relaxation and peace. I've lived near the ocean all my life_comma_ and while I do take it for granted from time to time_comma_ I try to remember how useful and beautiful it is.
Sometimes it means increased work commute_comma_ or higher costs of living. But sometimes that can be worth it in terms of the health benefits and lifestyle improvements that come along with it. It's all a balance. I'm glad you seem to have found yours!
that is awesome! 
It will save you a lot of money too
Oh nice. What will you be binge watching?
Hope you find something you like.
She will do great. OR she might not want to have kids be he is such a handful
Lids today are so picky about everything. Its sort of strange. Its nothing like when I was growing up
That's terrible. Sometimes it's hard to know who your real friends are_comma_ and it takes repeated attempts to hang out with them_comma_ only to have them bail on you_comma_ to realize that you're not valued by them. I say cut your ties sooner rather than later. Life's too short.
Oh man... When you consider all that_comma_ then yeah_comma_ definitely cut ties. If they did that to me more than twice_comma_ then I would realize really quick that they weren't the type to depend on or waste time on. I feel sorry for you. People should have friends that recognize their worth and be able to respect that relationship. Go out and find you someone who will.
Wow_comma_ that sounds exciting!
I love a good rock concert!
Oh god. Someone did pick up their dog's poop_comma_ hu?
It must've been. I hope that never happens to you again.
I bet it did.
Not too many of those around nowadays
oh that was good of you.
oh haha i know that feeling.
thats a good idea.
Thats a bummer
Whos concert?
Nice. Are you excited?
I hope it's what you expected to be!
That is so sweet of your cat.
Well_comma_ I hope you get better soon.
Oh sweet. Sin city! What do you look forward to doing?
Oh yea. I heard the buffets there are amazing.
Good for you.You are an exampler brother.
That is so hard to imagine.She will need all the help she can get from you.
That is great to hear.  Anything in particular?
Cthat sounds amazing!
Oh god that's terrifying haha. I hate snakes.
I know what you mean_comma_ they are cool to look at but if they are near me it spooks me hard.
That's tough. I have two older brothers_comma_ so I know how that is. We're separated by four and eight years_comma_ respectively_comma_ so we weren't as close as you two seem to be_comma_ but I always liked having them around.
Well_comma_ absence always does make the heart grow fonder. It will make your relationship a little strained_comma_ but the time you guys do get to spend together maybe will mean more and you can enjoy it more. Hopefully his college work doesn't stress him out too much for him to be able to enjoy hanging out.
Your husband sounds awesome. That's interesting that you're the type of person that actually likes birthday parties. Most people I know would be too embarrassed or self-conscious to enjoy them_comma_ and they'd feel uncomfortable. Especially me. But for you_comma_ I'm glad you can get into them. 
Oh_comma_ I didn't mean anything about the age! Who cares about that. I'm just a doofus when it comes to social interaction_comma_ so I get nervous and avoid things that put attention on me. But I hope you have a lot of fun_comma_ especially since your husband went through so much effort. I bet he knows you and what you like well and it will be great.
Oh no!  My gut feels sick for you having to go through that.  It happens to all of us but its so painful and awkward.  How did the neighbors take it?
Its so commendable that you went over and told them right away.  Not everyone would do that.  Your actions increases my faith in the goodness of people.
That is cool.  When did you learn?
That is awesome
Oh that's rare. How come?
Oh now I see lol. Who's your favorite team?
Oh wow_comma_ that's nice of you! What kind?
I love BMWs. They must've been so happy!
I'm so sorry.  Are you okay?
Oh goodness_comma_ you will find someone better.
Are you exited about it.Do you play the piano.
Well_comma_ there is your chance
Oh  yea? What's happening this weekend?
That's awesome. How long are you guys going to be there?
That sucks. Did you get a raincheck on your birthday though?
I'm glad they did that for you. So it wasn't all that bad having to work on your birthday then.
Uh oh. Was someone in there?
Oh wow! That is kind of scary.
That's good to have land you own.
Privacy is so important to have sometimes.
That isn't cool.  Is there anyone else that sells it?
That is good
That's great.  What is the good news?
I am very happy for you!
Oh me too! I heard it will be the last one.
Me too! I hope we both enjoy it a lot!
Good for you. I always had communication problems with my parents 
Yes_comma_ you should_comma_You are very lucky.
You and me both my friend
I know it is so disturbing
That is great_comma_ how long has it been since?
Well I hope you have fun!
That’s awesome!  Is she a good one?
I am really glad to hear that. 
That was nice. I just recenlt had a baby. It was amazing!
Thanks! What band did yall see?
That's interesting. What makes you confident? 
Ah I see. That would be a good guess then.
Is there a reason.Are you expecting bad news?
I am sure you are prepared for this interview.
What did you see?
Wow! That is a miracle!
Good luck in your camping.I hope you have a lot of fun.
You are going to ace that interview
What are you planning?
That sounds really fun. Hopefully you have some help.
What do you think?
I can understand that
Why? What did they do?
I understand your frustration.
Really?? You probably were been very scared.
What kind of ghost it was?
Inclined to do what?
That is cool.  How did you do?
Yes! sometimes I like such gatherings
Ha ha ha. yes indeed!
Why would they do that?
Man did you say anything?
That was really sweet of him!
I am very happy for you!
Why is that?
Oh that's so bad. But_comma_ at least you realized your mistake. You are a good person.
Yes_comma_ I did.I t was a great game.
Are you kidding?? They were the favorites all the way.
What are you afraid of?
Wow_comma_ that sounds terrible.
Are you happy for him or jealous?
Well_comma_if he really is your friend you shouldn't.
ohh! why?
Yes! that's very bad. I don't like it either
Did you miss someone or a place maybe.?
I am sorry to hear that.I am sure he is in a better place.
What is the reason? Did he get a great job offer?
Families move all the time.The kids will be fine.
What did she do?
Oh wow! That is very impressive!
I'm sorry to hear that.  Will you dog be okay?
I wish only the best for him.
I love scary movies. What was it?  Was it good?
That’s fun though
oh wow i hope it went well for him that takes a lot of courage.
that is really great.
Wow_comma_ that is really gross.
I can sympathize with you.
Congratulations.You must be very proud of her.
I am sure she will graduate with honors and get a great job
That is not good. What seems to be the cause?
I am so sorry. That must be very difficult.
Oh really? Why would you be scared?
I see. A war would be horrible.
I am sorry to hear that.What is the reason for this?
I am sorry to hear that.Do you have full cover insurance.
that really sucks_comma_ i dont know the feeling tho.
she sounds like a rude person.
Oh that's cool_comma_ how long did the graduation last?
That's a little annoying_comma_ since you just have to sit there and wait for it to end haha.
That is cool_comma_ sounds like a good time.
I totally agree with you. He's great!
I can not disagree with you.
I am sorry to hear that.We you expecting somthing very expensive?
Did you get in touch with  the postal office?
oh thats a weird thing to say.
saying you are scary is weird tho???
I am sorry to hear that.Following a diet is very stresffull.
You probably need to get more motivated.
I'm so sorry.  Will you be okay?
I hope you will feel better.
What show is that?
Do you watch any other shows?
Will you be hosting a Thanksgiving party at your home?
Does your Mother's house have any animals?
When did you find out?
I guess she didn't get a cat then.
It is good to stay informed.
I am glad people still pay attention to the outside world.
That is very bad_comma_ you should return it.
When did you do it?
That's good. What kind of parade was it?
Oh my gosh! I would have been so mad. Did you call them and complain? They need to fix it.
That is a good thing. I am sure you are a great mom.
I do have kids. Being a mom can be hard_comma_ but it is so rewarding.
That's a shame_comma_ you shouldn't have to do that.
Things will get better soon.
Did you call the manager and complain?
You should of called and told them.
I'm sorry_comma_ how do you feel?
I hope you can forgive yourself.
Do you talk softly?
You should tell them.
It is great to have a brother you can count.
I am sure he can also count on you for everything
How long have you been married?
Do you have any children?
I am sure you looked just fine.
I am sure it was not that bad.
Did you take the offer?
That was nice of him.
Oh no that is horrible. Is he okay?
I hope he can do so quickly!
Why do you feel at peace?
What did you do with them?
wow thats crazy.
i bet it was with something like that.
I am so happy for you!
Did you go on any rides?
I think he is doing a great job.
No_comma_ I am well educated. He lowered taxes. 
Really?.You are a loser
You should better yourself and fix this situation.
That is very nice of her.
That's nice you can rely on her.
That wasn't very nice.
You should return it.
Oh wow_comma_ that's exciting!
I'm also going to college in the fall_comma_ but I'm gonna be a sophomore.
How did she dump you?
Will you still be friends with her?
oh wow that is awesome.
yea i bet it does.
Did she not get it?
Will she apply elsewhere?
It is unacceptable for a friendship. I think you should not behave in such a way ever again
You should. You must immediately let your friend know and apologize for your behavior
That is a very nice gesture by them.
You must have some great people in your life.
What did you do?
You should sue them.
Oh no_comma_ what did you steal?
That is not right.  Do you feel bad?
Really? That's amazing_comma_ what words?
That's really exciting_comma_ I'm happy for you.
Did you hurt yourself?
Did they laugh at you?
oh thats so cool.
i bet you were so happy.
That was smart of you.
You would be a good planner.
Did you do it in person?
You should of done it in person.
Don't worry_comma_ you will be fine.
Just have faith and everything will work out.
That is good that you are happy about his efforts. 
I guess it depends on what the next couple of years hold.
That is nice of them.
You are well prepared.
That's good. Anything special happening?
Ah_comma_ so you feel confident about it?
When is she coming?
How long is she staying?
I've never had to do it before_comma_ have you?
I'm sure it was_comma_ I hope the next time isn't as bad for you.
Did you expect it?
There are other girls out there.
How did you do?
When do you get the grade?
I'm sorry_comma_ why did you get fired?
Things will work out if you stay positive.
Do you live in a place where it regularly rains? 
As it is summer_comma_ i was a bit surprised to see raining in your place
oh my gosh i completely agree on the loneliness thing
i dont to be honest just try to get through the day but ive never been in a relationship so it gets bad
oh my_comma_ was it worth it?
what a joke! are you going to sue?
How did that happen?
That's okay_comma_ she will forgive you.
What did you do with it?
What did you spend it on?
I have never played that game.
How old are you
Oh damn_comma_ you had cancer before?
I'm sure it was_comma_ hopefully it's gone for good.
oh yea im the same_comma_ gonna be wild.
oh thats awesome_comma_ you are a good person_comma_ we need more booze people
Did you watch TV?
What do you watch on netflix?
I love it too! It's really fancy.
I know right! It's weird how it's faster than a gasoline car.
Did you run away?
Did you kill it?
Is this your first home?
How big is the house?
Good for you. Many are getting into car loan and struggling with car payments
You should be grateful for having such a caring father
I hope you do too!
Hard work always pays off.
That was nice of him.
Will he let you drive it?
That is so sweet of you> I am sure that makes her so happy.
You are making memories that will last a lifetime.
What are you going to do while he is away?
Will you be able to call him?
oh thats a very big position.
dang thats shooting high
Who invited you?
Are you going to accept the invite?
I wish I was also tall. It must be nice.
That would be very helpful.
How long did you have it for?
Can you buy a new one?
I am sure your hard work will pay off!
It is always a good thing to stay optimistic.
That is wonderful. Is he now considering going to college?
Good for him. Has he taken any SAT tests yet?
I'm sorry_comma_ are you jealous?
You will find a good career.
Did they have permission to take it?
I hope you can learn to forgive them for it. 
oh no! did you block your cards?
what are you going to do about it?
I'm happy about that. Got a party planned?
You seem very excited. I hope it turns out the way you want it to.
eww thats awful.
i bet it was.
That sounds like fun!
I'm sure you had a good time!
That sounds like you were confident in your decision. Did you think it through?
That sounds like you were happy with the decision that you made. 
Why your parents? Can't you buy it yourself_comma_ all on your own like a grown ups?
I am sorry to hear that. I think you should join your parents when they go shopping for a pet to a store
I really love those types of shows. Remember what it was called?
Oh cool_comma_ I've never watched that one before!
Physics is an interesting subject_comma_ but it can get difficult to understand sometimes.
Hopefully you won't have to take an additional Physics course in the future!
Well that's not very nice! Why'd you do that?!
I would sure hope so! That poor kid.
That sounds like a fun project!
Patience is always a good thing.
Why did you have to do that?
Oh I bet that was embarrassing. I have had that happen too.
When and where is his first solo concert?
Fantastic_comma_ I imagine you must be so proud.
oh that really suckks.
i see what you mean i would be too
That sounds like a fun night.
I am happy for you.
did he get you?
they do look a little scary! 
Oh thats great_comma_ good work.
oh yea i work out a lot and im no where close so you must work hard
Did you do it on purpose?
You've got to be careful_comma_ that can cause a very serious accident!
Really? lol
It will be
Are you okay?
I'm glad you didn't get hurt.
oh no. are you at an elevated area?
always good to be prepared
Congrats! That is a good feeling.
Your hard work is paying off! Keep it up.
I'm afraid of public speaking or performing in crowds_comma_ so that takes courage! How did it go?
That's great! You have to keep a good attitude about it. I hope you get the part you want!
can you even find one like that now?
definitely good old days!
That's really impressive! Education is really important.
That's cool. It's good to be supportive of your friends.
thats scary_comma_ i hate that stuff.
haha thats quite funny
I am sure it does. It is same for me. I was also raised in the 90s.
Yes it was. I miss that time in my life.
That sounds amazing! I love it when families adopt and give a loving child a home.
That's so sweet!! I see you said she was a baby_comma_ but how old is she currently? 
Oh cool! What part of Texas were you going to check out?
Yes_comma_ the beaches there would be really fun to go explore. Plus lots of sight seeing!
thats horrible so sad :/
i bet it is_comma_ so sad.
thats nice of you but so hard to deal with
That's good to hear he's doing so well. Did you have a lot of input?
Teachers? Well it's not always the case. I never let school interfere with my education
Is there something specific that you are scared about?
Slow down. Do not jump into such conclusions so fast. I highly recommend you to immediately reach out to a doctor
Really.Did anybody get hurt.
Do you have full cover on you car?
So sorry to hear that. It's not easy
Well done. I'm sure she'll appreciate it
That does sound boring because you had no one to interact with_comma_ but at least you had some privacy.
I see. It would be quite lonely without a roommate to share the experience with.
thats so nice of you.
i bet it is.
I have never had an accident. Been driving for 22 years now
Trash cans? How odd. Maybe you should complain to the city
Maybe it is your imagination.The were probably catching up.
You should not be so insecure about your partner.It is not healthy.
It seems under Trump_comma_ the economy is booming as he promised
Indeed. Many thought that way_comma_ but he actually delivered on his promises
That is sad. Did he pass away?
I bet it does. I am so sorry. Try to think of all the good times with him.
Did she.How did it go?
Congratulations.You probably are very proud of her.
Me either_comma_  they have done so much for me in my life.
wow_comma_ thats so nice.  there are alot of people in life who have no one.
Yes there are. It is so sad.
It is difficult when we all have busy lives and limited resources.
oh no. how many people do you think noticed?
funny how nobody told you about it
I bet that is really enjoyable. Are you going anywhere fun?
Have fun! That sounds like a great time.
Oh_comma_ that sounds rough. Were you successful?
That's great! I'm happy for you. I hope you get along real well
Sounds rough. Did it do any major damage?
Good! I'm glad it worked out for you guys at least
You must have been overjoyed. I know what he meant to you.
Be sure and put it in a safe place.
Well that's not right no matter what your excuse because now you're not trustworthy see
It's better to end things than to wait for years. Don't waste any more time like I did. 4 years
That's always good to hear. What's going on?
That sounds like a fun time! Enjoy!
That sounds like it is exciting but also a lot of work. 
Wow how kind of her! You are lucky to have such a good mom.
wow_comma_ And did you ever end up finishing the project?
I see_comma_  what did you do instead
Really?
Sometimes I do
I'm not sure what you mean_comma_ but disntance does tend to make things more difficult
That's hard_comma_ but he will be back! Try to take your mind off him by doing some fun activities
That's horrible!  This is why they say never a lender nor a borrower be..
I hope it wasn't a lot of money.  Sometimes it takes a hard lesson to learn whom to let in your life.
Sorry to hear.  Will you be planning anything special?
If you have other family member around you_comma_ ask around and get everyone involved.  It should be nice.
I bet that was a nice surprise.
That is so cool. 
Wow_comma_ how are you adjusting?
Have you tried to go out and make friends?
I'm so sorry to hear that. I love my dog
He can live on in memories perhaps
who did?
did you like what she bought?
Really? That is a crazy thing to do
Did anything happen to him?
I'm sorry to hear that. Did you have the files backed up at all?
Wow_comma_ that's so lucky! I should do that as well just in case!
Aw_comma_ that's adorable! I bet he's the cutest thing
That's awesome. I want a baby nephew :(
I can understand your feelings. That's a tough situation.
That is good that you trust him_comma_ but temptation is never good for anyone.
That's really tough.  But one closed door leads to the next great opportunity.
That's horrible!  If you don't have insurance there are a lot of pro bono lawyers that will take your case.  Report it to the police so it is documented and justice will prevail.  You don't deserve or need to put up with that.
What a nice gift! My little brother did the same for me actually. Xbox one S last year
Oh yes. Got like 400 games on it.
Knew who_comma_ exactly?
Someone randomly walked up to you and kissed you? That's odd
Really? Why did you do that?
OK
When will she be returning?
How are you keeping yourself occupied?
Wow that sounds like a lot of fun!
What was your favorite part of the trip?
Oh yeah? What is it?
Oh my days lol. That's a classic. I like 2 stupid dogs myself
Has she taught him to sit?
wow she must be a really good dog owner_comma_ is this her first?
That had to make you feel good. It is so easy to forget when your trying so hard to remember. LOL
I always make a list before a trip and triple check it before I leave.
That's terrible!  How did you find out?
It's hard to find forgiveness for something like that.  Still it's better that he confessed than you having to find out otherwise.  If only a little better/
Congratulation. How it went?
That is very nice. Congratulation.
Oh no! I hate that happened and I bet it was scary because it looked like someone broke in. But now you have a repair bill. Sorry that happened to you.
I hope the person's conscience makes them feel guilty and they come clean about the situation! And hopefully reimburse you!
Sounds like fun. What you got planned ?
Got any family out there? Cousins perhaps
What kind is it_comma_ Cuban?
Cool_comma_ I like those_comma_ but they are crazy expensive_comma_ if you want a thick one.
Why you don't invite a friend to come with you?
Why don't you take a guide or a book to help visit?
Oh no I am so sorry. Did you have flood insurance at least?
Did you lose anything you can't replace? Important documents or pictures? Must be some bright light.
i bet_comma_ sounds like it would be nice.
yea but exams can still really suckk
Movies can be emotional_comma_ do you remember the film?
That's a good movie. Yes_comma_ time really goes by fast and those memories remind us of the good times.
What was it about?
Did succeed at anything?
Wow that's so cool! Which comics were they?
Oh yeah that would be such a fun find!
Sweet_comma_ where abouts are you going?
No doubt_comma_ do you have a tour guide or is it just free for you to roam about?
What about 5?
I still have no idea what do you mean?
Oh god_comma_ that's awful! Is she alright?
That would make sense_comma_ assuming she is getting pretty old.
Oh no_comma_ did she say something really upsetting?
Oh that's the worst...I wish people would just say what they want to say
oh do you have summer classes?
eh its not bad_comma_ its quite productive 
Man that sounds like the dream. Watching anything good?
The British version of the U.S. version? 
Not my pick but I am glad you get a laugh out of it.
Oh my gosh. Why did your pants fall?
Were you able to laugh it off or were you so mortified you wanted to crawl out of the room?
I understand. Were you able to manage the situation?
It is ok. It was a scary situation.
What kind of problems?
Do you have enough time for it?
Why_comma_ what did he tell you?
She must really be a good friend_comma_ how are you repaying here?
Is it a type of work you've been wanting to get into for a while?
Wow_comma_ engineering_comma_ sounds impressive.  I'm sure the income will be awesome.
That sounds great! What are you growing?
That sounds delicious and healthy also.
It's nice to be able to look back. It can really give you perspective on your life now.
That is so true. After all we can't change the past only learn from it.
Why would they do such a thing?
That is so bad_comma_ the police should be called for that.
I understand.
Those kind of thing happened from time to time.
oh yea i know the feeling
oof thats harsh i feel for you
yea its insane that hes a political figure
yea and immigarants
That is disgusting_comma_ What did you do to clean it?
Did the smell went away?
Family members are awesome_comma_ what was the situation? 
I am glad everything turned out alright!
I bet you are happy as never before.
You are lucky that your girlfriend is a gamer.
Good for them for taking the initiative and helping the family.
You must of done something right in raising them. 
Why would you do such a thing?!
That is unacceptable_comma_ find a job!
That's great. What made you feel that.
That's a great feeling_comma_ I don't like having any kind of bill anyway.
Did you got the grade?
That is nice. Congratulation.
thats horrible
oh thats nice
That is great! What actor is it?
That sounds like a great time. I hope you have fun.
I hear this from a lot of people. You should get over that fear somehow.
Yes_comma_ but not impossible.
oh yea i can imagine
yea seems very boring
I do like netflix as well
Those are the best days
Oh I am sorry to hear that. What was the test?
I hope everything turns out well for you.
Oh no! How was your co-worker doing afterwards?
He had a good amount of time to recuperate. That's good to hear.
What movie was it?
Oh a western.  I used to watch westerns with my dad as well.
ooh sorry how is it now does he have a job
ok sorry for that 
What was?
I am not sure what you are talking about
That is very kind of you. You sound like a good husband.
What did you get for her?
Sorry to hear that. Did you try to find similar job position on the job market?
I understand.
wow me too we had fun
yeah it was fun too
That would be weird
Sorry you had to see that
I bet that was embarrassing
I am sorry_comma_ bad on them
Why did you have to give the dog away? It must have been very upsetting.
Oh I see_comma_ but you can still see it right? If you visit the new owner.
Why did you do that? You must feel terribly guilty for stealing someone's money.
Well_comma_ its good that you realize it was a bad action. I would say pass some money on to a person in need.
That must have been a very special moment in your life.
Did you get professional photos taken?
What did you like
Oh that sounds nervewracking
so good
good i dint get as a kid
You must have been well prepared then!
Good_comma_ I wish my teammates would practice as much.
That is not good
I am sorry_comma_ you will get another one
ooooh thats so bad what happened
sorry now how is the situation
What was a good time?
I am not sure what you enjoyed
yeah me too
yeah its such nice
What is so bad?
Did you see this for yourself?
That's sweet.  What kinds of things would he do to make you feel better?
When I was a kid my dad would put my medication on a small plate guarded by a green army man.
haha that was serious 
ok what happened next
I'm not sure what we are talking about here. 
That's terrible. Did you kick her to the curb?
Family time is a very important part of life.
What did you have for Thanksgiving dinner?
I am glad you found it
You can always research it more
Its okay_comma_ you were young
You shouldnt do that
Sometimes we have to part ways with our loved ones. Dont be mad at him.
You are not what anymore?
hahahahahaha he must be cunning
ooooh no i feel sorry but punish him
You should be. You should be paid on time for your hard work.
You should report them to the police.
That is pretty gross! I hope he cleaned it up later.
That should be the last time you let him borrow it.
That is so nice to hear. How long have you been together?
That is a long time. I wish the both of you well and excitement! 
I am sorry that happened_comma_ you will find another job
You just need to start looking
It seems you were anticipating for a long time. Which movie did you watch/
I have heard its good. Did you like it?
Congratulations to you both.  You must be a very proud parent.
I bet he will enoy that immensely.  A good reward for succeeding at a difficult challenge.
Oh my_comma_ is he alright?
That is good to hear. You must be strong for him! 
I am sure it will go away
That does sound annoying
oh sorry 
did you improve
I do love to work
I hope you work hard going forward
I am happy for you
That sounds fun
Well life can be surprising! Why did he move home?
Oh I see_comma_ did he go to college?
Were you okay
I am sure everyone forgot about it
You must have been well prepared for it! Good on you
Did you get an A?
I bet that was fun
Wine can be good
That is sad to hear. But these things happen in life
You just have to move on and be positive!
Thats not good_comma_ at least they got there
There is always next year
That must have been exciting for you. What car was it?
Nice do you still have it or did you sell it?
that's cool what was it a about
ok cool how was it
Yes he is very much
That is a good thing
I bet that was scary
Ha_comma_ that is funny
Yea you should just make an excuse and ask for excusal_comma_ like me!
Save it for next time! 
oooh sorry did you give up
no you should not that's not the end of you 
What was a joy?
I see_comma_ you must have felt very happy about it!
Wow_comma_ you must have been pretty confident then.
I hope you did your best and got the grade you wanted.
oh thats good why is that
thats wonderful
Glad to hear you made it through.  What caused the accident?
Drunk drivers are the worst.  I am always on the look out for them because.  I'd be thanking God too if I was in your shoes.
oh no that was bad
sorry what did you do the next day
it doesnt happen often as i am a supervisor at work
yea i would too
That is such good news. What did you get?
Wonderful choice. Those are very dependable and fun to drive.
When I was younger I lived in an apartment by myself. I missed having family around.
I wanted to be on my own but I just didn't realize how it would be by myself.
Oh no! You should never lash out on people while drunk_comma_ the worst of things can happen under the influence.
I think the best thing to do is talk to her and apologize. If you admit to you being foolish she may find it to forgive you.
Were you as freaked out as I would have been?
What did he do with it?
It is good to reflect every now and then. Do you have any regrets?
Thats nice_comma_ i took feel emotional when thinking about the old days.
I'm sure you were worried sick. Did you find it?
Is there anything I can do to help find it? 
that sucks
thats understandlble
wow where were you going
ooh i guess you were afraid
I feel ashamed of myself_comma_ what about you?
You should never think that way. Failure is a part of life.
Why were mad?  Where did the dog go?
Maybe he/she had a significant other.  Dogs need love too.
Oh no_comma_ what happened? Did the invitations not get out or were people busy?
That is so weird_comma_ maybe try contacting them and see what happened. Sorry to hear.
Oh no. Did it run off or stay close by?
Hopefully he didn't get hurt. It might be time to put a lock on the gate.
who saved you?
well that was observant of her.. sometimes people dont even notice 
I bet you were happy
That is always nice
What was the name of the movie?
I know this movie but it seems a nice movie. What did it reminded you from your childhood?
What did you do
I am not sure what you picked up
wow that's nice 
yeah i can  imagine
I wish you luck in that_comma_ the chances of winning the lottery are super slim!
Never give up hope. I like your thinking.
I am too_comma_ it looks good
That has been fun
That is very nice of your aunt. What kind of laptop was it?
I have dells are really reliable! 
thats gross
yea i wouldnt either
That is very nice. In which industry did you get your job?
I didn't understand you.
i believe i am
Rightly said! It always comes in handy!
oh wow i couldnt even imagine
yuk
I hope you were no too upset.  The odd of winning are super low!
That is a good outlook to have.  A little chance is better than no chance!
Aw really? He is a great player anyways
Hopefully he continues his streak at LA as well
Hopefully so_comma_ he is not making it easy for them or anyone!
Apparently everyone is our enemy now_comma_ how sad!
Aww_comma_ what happened? You missed something emergency?
So sorry to hear that man.. i hope you get to go very soon
How hopeful.. I will make sure to pray for you guys. best wishes
I really hope you guys get it
What don't you like about the cars?
That could be possible_comma_ make sure you watch out during the night time!
Thats a good attitude to have. Did you do well?
Awesome! So happy for you my friend
Aww_comma_ did you miss your plans?
Sorry to hear that my friend.. hopefully it works out better next time
I would have to loved to see that btw! Do you dance with friends or alone?
I can understand that. You are more passionate than others
Try not to be too envious!  What kind of car is it that you want so bad?
I guess you can just start trying to save for it.  Don't be jealous or it will eat you up inside!
I understand how you feel. I wonder how those people afford it.
I'm sure if you work hard you could afford it too.
oh no.. what happened?
Sorry to hear that my friend. I hope things work out for you at work soon enough
Oh that would be awesome! How much is the lottery for?
I really hope you get it buddy
Sorry to hear that.. Did you miss something important?
Oh shoot.. I wish you get to go soon enough buddy
oh cool buddy.. how much did you win?
Alright_comma_ anyways good for you!
No_comma_ I missed it_comma_ but I do usually watch UFC fights!  Were there quick knock outs?
Knock outs are the best!  When was UFC established?  I feel like it was been around for a while!
That is insane.  You might want to take it elsewhere.
The prices have risen alot with all the technology and electrical components.
Oh no. I can't imagine not having AC in this heat.
I hope you can get it fixed easily. I know they are not cheap to replace.
Good reason to be scared.  What steps are you both taking to increase security?
A good sound plan.  You're right it is a father's responsibility to protect his family.
I found a bunch of dead mice few days ago
Haha.. thats a really funny story!
That sounds like a nice plan.  Do you often get the chance to take days off?
I've been thinking of forcing myself to take time off.  We all need a break from time to time.
Friends and UFC sounds like a great night!  I missed the fight.  Were there any good knock outs?
Awesome!  Was that who you were hoping would win?
I hope you get it too!  Best of luck!  We all could use extra money in the pocket!
When will you find out?
Sounds promising.  Are you coming out of long dry spell?
That's pretty short.  I went 7 years.  Decided the next girl I met I'd marry_comma_ we just celebrated 13 years toghether.
Holy cow that's awesome for you!  How are you feeling today?
That's amazing.  Did something happen recently that made you happy?
Awesome!  You must be excited!  Where are you going?
I am sure he will!  Florida is a great place to visit!
Oh no. Did it eat something bad?
I'm sure she is okay. My dog throws up randomly too sometimes.
oh cool.. Is it in the field you like?
Good for you :) I wish and pray you get it buddy
What a nice thing to do.  Do you know what breed?
Is he a young dog or old?
Awesome!  What are you all going to do there?
That sounds awesome!  Any beer drinking at the beach?  That's my favorite!
Are you also going for a trip?
Nice. Where is your destination?
I love when my dog does that.  Did it take you long to train him.
How do you reward her?
That sucks_comma_ so did you waste a lot of time on it?
Yeah_comma_ I would be too_comma_ it only takes like a couple minutes to email..  So are you going to get in trouble?
Cool. Are you going alone or with friends?
Good for you. To be honest_comma_ i do not really enjoy attending live concerts
What happened?  Do tell :)
Well.. I guess I will never know...
Oh Snap!  wow... That was a surprise!  
I bet! Where are you going on vacation?
Wow! Hawaii sounds like a great place to vacay.  I have never been there_comma_ have you?
Oh yeah_comma_ I didn't even think about that.  It was terrifying to watch on tv.  I hope you are staying somewhere safe.
That's awesome.  Are you traveling with others?
I am so sorry.  That has been happening a lot lately on the East Coast.
I feel your pain I am in Florida.
That's sad. Did you give him a burial at sea?
Do you plan on getting another fish?
I feel you_comma_ nothing irritates me more than a dog that won't stop barking.  Any plans to fix the problem?
Ha_comma_ neither.  Look into some barking collars or maybe some training.
Is it something that you want to do?
That's a great invitation then. Will you be able to go?
Did you pay a locksmith to come get it open for you?
I had to go that route once.  and my truck has some sort of special chip in the key. I literally had to have my truck towed to  the dealership.
Congrats!! That's wonderful. why do you feel unease ?
i understand. It is hard to start but i'm sure you will make new friends at your new job!
Well I love my husband and I have cheated so it really one doesn't have much to do with the other.
its not about cheating... you can love someone but if they don't meet certain needs_comma_ not just sexual... you can get it elsewhere but that doesnt negate your love for the person who is unable to fulfill your needs
Same here.  Is it because of needed prepartations or because of family drama?
Drama is never good.  I usually don't re-invite people who bring it with them.
what is CBD oil? I feel bad for you.. i fell you though_comma_ i recently started having bad anxiety attacks_comma_ i will see a doctor in 2 weeks
I don't think i would ever be comfortable using cannabis. even if it's legal. but i'm really glad it worked for you
It can be infuriating.  Do you call or send texts?
My Mom sends me texts a lot.  But I'm not always looking at my phone.  When she calls though I usually answer.
Oh no! Were you drunk!
Did you wake up with a big bruise?
It happens. Have to be careful sometimes.
Look on the bright side_comma_ you'll have some extra free time
I think you'll end up fine.  Its an important milestone.
Now that's a nice surprise.  You must have really impressed them.
I'd take it.  You sound like you might be good at it.
i wish i could send our rain your way! It's been raining here for weeks!!
It's been very nasty humid and hot in VA for the past 3 weeks
Good for you. Religion can be a source of hope and optimism for many people in times of distress
I also try to find some time and attend church services whenever possible
oh that's ok_comma_ put more efforts next time. i believe you will come out of flying colors
is the work you are doing interests you_comma_ or else you would need to change the job
Sounds like a good time.  I'm not surprised. Do you take them often?
That sounds like lots of fun.
Oh that's so rough. I had a dog die a few years ago and it was traumatic.
How did she die?
I'm sorry. At least she isn't suffering anymore.
Takes a good student to get that honar.  Wad he speach good?
I used to be scared of it too.  Trick for me was to memorize my speaches and tune out while giving them.
that's really good! Huge step :) How do you like your new place?
Maybe you could get a pet? 
Congrats! I bet that makes you feel great!
That is really not a good feeling. I am glad you came out of it.
good for you my friend! Darkness is nothing to be scared about
I'm so happy for you_comma_ way to go!
I hear great reviews_comma_ people who have played it are raving about it
I wish you get it as soon as possible buddy
Oh shoot.. What did you do? did you find it back?
damn.. hope your affairs are in control
By this time you probably have the process all down pat!
I have heard that_comma_ diapers and formula are expensive for no reason
They sure are! I try to breastfeed but usually can't do that for more than 6 months so I'm hoping I can keep my milk supply up longer. It really does cost a fortune.  I also use reusable diapers at home.
That is so cool!  Also_comma_ its great how proud you were of him.  When did that happen?
What happened?
oh no :( It happens though_comma_ it wasn't your fault!
tell me about it! My phone keeps freezing and it's so slow. 
It is frustrating! Especially when you need to call someone or text someone quickly and you need to wait for your phone to start working
I can relate.  I have a colleague that seems better at everything than me and is now supervisor.  Just don't let jealousy take over your life. That will only hurt you.
Just focus on what you do have_comma_ which I'm positive is a lot going for you!  You can also develop so many more good skills with focus and determination.  Just give it time and the hard work you're already doing.
They went into your yard to take the tree out?? Is that even legal?
Wow_comma_ well I hope it is a simple case and you get reimbursed heavily!
Some times kids deserved to be yelled at.
True.  Kids can be pretty infuriating. Especially at very young ages.
That's awesome. I just started working out.
Both. I'd like to lose 40 pounds and be more defined.
Aw_comma_ how sweet. Tell the little one that i said congrats
I think so too. something is wrong
That would have been nice_comma_ gotta play to win as my grandma always said
Do you play often?
sorry hear that.
yea thats true
Hey that's awesome!  Congrats!
I know.  I'm proud of you though.  That takes commitment and courage!  
Was it someone you were close to?
Oh_comma_ well I am still sorry for your loss
Oh no.. I hope you were not hurt
No actually_comma_ i always wanted to though
I feel you buddy.. Family is above everything
Very true_comma_ family is always a sense of support
don't feel sad_comma_day will pass and present is the best moment and live
Be faithful in small things because it is in them that your strength lies 
thats a good person to have around it appears
nah i am a supervisor so we really cant discuss anything going on with them
oh man :( i hate when it happens! Did you have to go home?
sorry to hear that.
She waht?
Well what did she do? Everyone gets angry sometimes
don't be so hard on yourself! I'm sure there is something you are really good at and he is not
You will! Just concentrate on what you can do good and don't worry about other people
holddddd up.. he is making america great again
i dont know about all that 
You don't have any friends or family?
That means that you are right now at an immigration detention_comma_ right?
I have heard that if you look at one person in the audience and focus on them in their underwear you will relax
There is many ways to find the "relax zone" when speaking in front of a group.
did any competition have you attend in pool 
that good it makes you healthy 
That's a good way of saying live a good life.
Treat everyone the way you want to be treated.
That is impressive. Which law school have you applied?
I have a friend who recently graduated from there and have landed a job in a law firm
Ouch.  Debt ration does play a big factor in the scoring.
(*ratio)  I watch my score like a hawk.
damn.. what did you do?
haha.. did you find the friends?
I know your pain. I used to have to stay over often as well.
It sucks when your wife made said plans hahaha!
You have to have a good friend though for any help. Without a friend there is not help.
You are lucky to have a friend willing to help.
in every office the coworker are really good and fast
coworker can help you in different situation 
Yeah_comma_ where did you go?
Wow_comma_ that is a pretty awesome place to go!
sorry to hear that.

What pet did you get?
Oh wow_comma_ that is gonna be  anew experience for you!
Yikes_comma_ how much will it cost to replace?
That would be best_comma_ they can get expensive to fix
That's sad to hear.
It is. I've lost both of mine.  It will get better with time.
I would have peed myself_comma_ what did you do?
Oh_comma_ that is a smart move_comma_ I would have been just as scare
and... ?  what is going on?
Oh ok.. I was scared for a minute there.  Congratulations on your successful relationship! LOL
I know what you mean. My family is the only thing that keeps me going.
Its tough_comma_ but hey at least it's something.
What did she ask for?
Well that is a very expensive gift_comma_ she cannot expect to get stuff that costs so much!
oh when does it come out .. we just got mario aces.. it was ok 
i hope so
I completely understand. Can't live with them_comma_ can't live without them.  ha ha ha
How long you been together?
What fight did you watch?
Ah_comma_ did he win?
I am the black sheep in mine_comma_ self declared.
No he didn't.. but at least they were admitting they were assholes_comma_ you didn't have to wait till you were older to figure it out.
I absolutely love the casino_comma_  what is your slot machine of choice?
I love the one dollar slots_comma_ but I always loose everything
How rude!  Are you two roommates?

Yes I love combat sports.
Dillishaw is a warrior_comma_  Do you think very highly of connor?
I am sorry to hear that_comma_ I lost my grandmother to cancer_comma_ which did not make it anny better_comma_ knowing it was coming
I know_comma_ it is sad that people must pass_comma_ but I am grateful for the time I did get with her
Ive always wanted a nintendo switch_comma_ Is it any good?
How often do you play portably?
Yeah kids have moved on to YuGiYoh and other silly games.
At least pokemon go is popular now..
Where are you headed?
Wow_comma_ that should be interesting_comma_ have fun!
did you kill it ?
thats good
Why_comma_ what happened?
That makes sense_comma_ you gotta prepare for that my man_comma_ you know how that goes!
I love the switch_comma_ I have been thinking about buying my own.
Would you say you play it more at home or on the go?
That is amazing_comma_ what breed was it?
That is so great_comma_ did you keep it?
that's good that you trust her! It's hard to have a relationship if you don't have trust
i agree! I've been married for 5 years and i can't imagine being with anyone else but my wife
That is good_comma_ it can be easy to sink into a bad lifestyle with a kid or stressed wife
That makes sense too_comma_ that is all I eat now_comma_ my metabolism may catch me one day_comma_ I need to make changes as well_comma_ but great for you losing the weight!
I do that too.. I take small tiny ones usually.  I have pieces of the grandcanyon and everything
Sometimes but I like natural cool stuff better_comma_ and making collages out of brochures and free stuff I find along the way.
WHAT?! do you hear noises at night?
Oh_comma_ my_comma_ god_comma_ I have lived in a haunted house before_comma_  what do you smell?

What happened? did you run into traffic?
That is no fun_comma_  was his coach upset he was late_comma_ or did you even make it at all?
NO! they can be vermin_comma_  what did you do to get rid of him?
Did he jump up and run away?
That was nice of him..  Did you pay him back ever
THats really nice of you!  Was he surprised?
WHAT? I would be terrified!! 
So you actually saw it?? how did it look? did it say anything?
Has she tried to lie before but just been a terrible liar?
I am the same way_comma_ Every time I lie im thinking.  they dont believe me at all
that's good. did it actually turn out easy?
that's wonderful! Congrats! I didn't have a lot of easy classes when i was in college
Moving to a new place can make you uneasy_comma_ but once you make a couple of friends you'll get over it. 
New York is very beautiful and the people there are very friendly_comma_ so i'm sure you'll do fine. 
Oh_comma_ wow!  What happened?  
That stinks.  What did you do with your tickets?
why not? if it will possibly get you better
might as well find out now before it get worse
Good luck. That's always nerve racking waiting for them to call. I'm sure you did well though.
That is really exciting. I bet since you have a good feeling_comma_ they will call back.
What band is that?
They playing anywhere close?
thats good.. any plans
thats cool
how long have you been driving
ah thats cool
Wait_comma_ what happened?
How did he manage to open the gate?
That's good_comma_ new experiences can lead to new likes and dislikes. The important thing is that you keep an open mind. 
Exactly_comma_ hopefully you found a new hobby.
That was really nice of them and lucky they were able to help you.
Congratulations on graduating college and I wish you the very best.
That's cool! Do you play basketball frequently?
I feel the same. I used to be pretty athletic_comma_ but now I take in most sports from the comfort of my sofa!
I would try again_comma_ if you love her you might regret not giving it another try if she moves on.
Sounds like a good idea to go slow and make sure things don't get too heavy too fast.
I dont have kids either_comma_ sometimes when i go out with my friends im mainly the 3rd wheel and it feels weird _comma_ i feel your pain
Thats exactly how i feel_comma_ i have hanged out with them and its always kids crying and running around
Great! Will this mean a lower car payment for you? 
So happy for you! Yes- having extra money is always a reason to celebrate!
Did you guys ever fall out?
Wow_comma_ it's always the people that your closest to that end up changing.
That must have been so frustrating!!! Were you able to find them fairly quickly? And how?!
SO frustrating. Hopefully you were able to provide feedback to the owner. Not sure they could/can *do* anything about it_comma_ but still -- maybe you've helped pay it forward to the next visitor!
That's terrific! Is there anything in particular that makes you feel good about it?
But on a personal level_comma_ how do you experience that?
Language barriers can be pretty problematic. Always keep an open ear_comma_ though.
That's fair. The same would be true in any other nation.
You are so lucky! I love the Caribbean but I have never been to Barbados. Have you been there before?
Saint Lucia is absolutely beautiful. You were very lucky to go there.
Try to relax and think positive_comma_ visualize yourself acing the test.
You are being to negative.Whit this attitude_comma_ you are gonna fail for sure
It seems he is delivering on his promises. As you can see_comma_ the economic numbers are truly high
I think the tax cuts has made investors bullish on capital investment which Trump administration has passed as a law
Nice_comma_ I bet you feel so relieved!
I agree_comma_ second chances are awesome. They always surprise me because I don't expect much after the first chance.
Oh wow_comma_ I bet that's scary. Maybe there's something you could look into to help prevent that happening_comma_ that does not sound fun!
I agree_comma_ get those things OUT! I hope they never come back!
oh when and why?
oh my condolences for you_comma_ you would have good memories of it.
Ha! I've always loved the more festive Dia de los Muertos approach to the day rather than scare or gore! What's your favorite Halloween film?
SAME. Because when it came out_comma_ it felt groundbreaking! I remember being soooo scared and jumpy for weeks after seeing that.
I did not know that it was that high! That's amazing.
I guess so_comma_ and I am not even a Trump supporter.
I bet that disturbing and frightening when you have to see those. Especially when the thought of them is always lingering!
Hopefully you don't wake up and ruin your sleep over them too often.
Nice! You sound like you prepared very well
I love that feeling. Being prepared for whatever comes your way_comma_ good luck!
it definetly is. I'm glad schools are taking a stance against it
it definetly is. I hope we move forward to eliminate this issue
What happened?
Sounds a bit scary.  What did you do?
Oh my goodness I would have been terrified!
Thankfully he walked on past you but what a horrible experience all round.
Making music is a hard business to break into. The only way to make it is to keep practicing and to get a little lucky.
Even if nothing ever comes of music_comma_ you're still having fun I hope! Thats really what music is supposed to be about anyways. Making a few million is always a nice bonus though!
Of course. Good luck with the music career. I'm rooting for you
Wow_comma_ that's awesome and great that you're supporting her also.
What course or field?
what happened?
Oh my_comma_ I hope you are ok.
Cool_comma_ do you like older cars?
Was there any bikes there too?
Oh wow. I bet that was amazing!
I bet the weather was nice too!
oh that sounds good 
ya you should and you be proud of your achievement 
That's a wild occurrence. Jail can be harsh on anyone.
Yeah that's definitely the way to go. Get out as fast as possible.
Oh no! That's disgusting. They should take better care of him.
I would have been nauseous too.
Is bed rest where you stop working?
Me too. If she gets plenty of rest_comma_ the baby will be just fine.
sounds like a lot of waiting. did you do well?
very frustating but congratulations on the results
Hey_comma_ that's good I hope both do a lot of catching up 😊
I haven't been to the zoo in a long time_comma_ I hope you have fun.
Oh man_comma_ did you have plenty of food and water?
Dang well its a good thing that you made it out okay!
Don't worry_comma_ I do that all the time. I love binge eating lol
True but chips taste sooo much better
It's awful when you spend money on tickets and popcorn and it's a bad time. Did they put all of the best moments in the trailer?
I would be so annoyed. You could have stayed home and watched Twitch.
That's great! I hope you perform well and have a wonderful time. What is your profession?
Just take a few deep breathes and be confident!
That sounds like a great deal. Get the money and do something great with it.
Hopefully all goes well. We could use a little cash.
I have not seen any UFC movies. I guess I should watch one to give them a chance.
Who are some of your favorite fighters?
That's terrible maybe getting out of the house and checking out our yard sale will cheer you up. 
no problem! Hope to see you 
That's unfortunate. I have experienced similar things. I hope that she comes back around.
Yeah_comma_ it is. But just realize that you are not the one acting weird.
Nice! Usually Mondays suck but not for you! You are so lucky
Make the best of it! 
Ugh_comma_ I am with you on that. Mine has been doing that all week. It's so annoying and it costs even more to switch to someone else
Sometimes resetting the modem & router helps. But_comma_ it won't do much if the ISP isn't good to begin with. Careful with going too cheap_comma_ though_comma_ you might end up worse
Every adult has some nostalgic feelings of becoming a child again. Adult responsibilities are overwhelming
Indeed. Growing up_comma_ i now realize how much my parents have sacrificed in order to provide for me
Good luck! Hard work always pays off. 
Yes_comma_ you will coquer that exam!
That's great! What strategies are you using?
Have you heard of the ketogenic diet? I am thinking about going on it.
It is one where fats are 75% of the diet_comma_ protein is 20%_comma_ and carbohydrates are 5%. It's very difficult to do_comma_ but I think I am going to do it. You should look it up to see what it is all about
That's probably true_comma_ but who knows in this country.
I hope so. I think he will be out_comma_ but apparently his approval rating has gone up.
Awe I am so sorry to hear that.  What happened?
I imagine so.  The holidays are the times we really miss those who are no longer with us.  I hope in time though you can remember the happy times and the good memories you have made with her over the years.
LOVE the mountains. Mainly in the New Mexico / Colorado area -- but also to the Alps. How about you?
Lovely! Did you ski or sled? Sledding is a whoooooole different animal there!
That is such a bummer. Summer is an expensive time to travel. I went to Ireland in July but I bought the tickets in March so they were pretty cheap. 
Oh that is so frustrating. I'm sorry to hear that. I am a travel agent- flight prices fluctuate by the hour- keep watching_comma_ they might go back down. 
That's exciting!  I can't imagine getting upset over a surprise trip though!
I would be thrilled!  I think it's a great idea
That's probably great for your body and fitness.
That's great. Keep up the wonderful work. Do you diet well too?
Uh oh. For fun or you needed it for something?
Oh_comma_ I see. Well we all think differently about things we reflect on later. Use it as a personal lesson for other things in life
well_comma_ something must have gone wrong somehow_comma_ I think you should talk to your vet doctor
Yes I think you can try chaining it
oh that was so sad.don't fed up.you have to go through this problem
please don't worry .you have to be so confident in these times.keep going whatever happens
that's my duty friend.you have the power to defeat your problems.make it soon
Why? What happened?
Wow_comma_ what the heck. Tell your chief it was your assistant who did it
That is absolutely amazing. That could be an inspiration to so many different people.
You know that almost sounds like that could be a movie. There are so many people caught up with drugs today in the United States and around the world
Oh_comma_ I'm so sorry! Do you want to talk about it?
Argh! Was it an accident of some kind? I hope YOU are okay!
I love them too. What kind of dog do you have?
Awww_comma_ I bet they are. I don't have a dog right now but I want one. I just don't know what breed yet.
Wow_comma_ that is messed up. Why did your boss change mind so suddenly?
I guess that makes sense but still. I would have been furious and let them know I had a vacation planned.
Try to put yourself out there!  You can also try online dating!
Never stop trying!  There are plenty of fish in the sea!
woow that is good of her. encourage her to keep shinning
i love lawyers too especially the serious ones as they know how to bring back justice
wow_comma_ what happened?
I'm so sorry to hear about that
That's great. The community aspect of church is fun.
Yes_comma_ that's probably true. I bet they are very happy_comma_ too.
I feel you.I am that way to.I fear public speaking.
I t is an strong feeling for sure.
Why are you scared of Trump right now?
Lol_comma_ at least he is honest about being a lunatic.
ok_comma_ where do you live now
ya every one shares a good bond with our native places
Sometimes revisiting the past is great for personal reflection. Maybe contact those people sometime.
That's great! I bet she loved to hear your voice.
Thats unfortunate. Sometimes_comma_ people don't know how to make a move and are waiting for you to make a move.
Thats a good point. Now you are always going to wonder 'What if'?
That is good_comma_ that is a situation where confidence is very helpful.
Best of luck to you_comma_ I'm sure they saw your excitement and confidence and employers love that.
What's an ice chest? 
Oh_comma_ I should have known that. Do you have any leads on who might've stolen it?
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried to cheer them up?
Does she have any family you can call to check on her? 
On what situation? 
My opinion is I don't mind doing my own job but if I have to do my co-workers jobs_comma_ I would get furious. It is not fair?
I'm grateful for my limbs as well_comma_ this the reason I'm a hard worker. I appreciate what god gave me.
So t
That is so amazing! Do you love cats as much as I love dogs_comma_ Ha!
I found a cat too as a stray. We kept hoping we would find it's owner so never gave her a name so her name was forever Miss Kitty.
Oh_comma_ those are never fun. But they usually end up being better than you expect. 
But at least you took the time to prepare! That's better than some people
That's honestly really amazing_comma_ most people take forever to learn even a tiny bit of a foreign language.
Some people just have amazing dedication_comma_ something I don't seem to have.
Oh_comma_ that's awful. Did you mention it to anyone? 
Yay! So they threw you a surprise party! That's awesome. You must have been so happy. Was there cake?
What do you mean?
Ah_comma_ gotcha. I am a not strong republican and I agree with you. Trump has had his days.
I am sorry to hear that.Have you try dating APPS
Sometimes personality is better than looks
Oh my.  I'm so sorry to hear that.  What happened?
That's really sad.  I hear about fatal car accidents more and more these days.  
That's pretty awful. Some people have serious mental problems.
It is very sad.
Oh my_comma_ it must have been so scary! Do you live in an area commonly affected by hurricaines?
Was your home damaged? Was anyone hurt in your area? I've never seen a hurricaine_comma_ except on the news. 
You must have to pay a lot for insurance. The weather certainly is getting more unpredictable. 
Air conditioning is very nice. My dogs love the outdoors but they want AC after a good_comma_ long walk!
Yes it is very hot and humid where I am. Always makes a good excuse to kick back in a nice_comma_ cool house!
Video games is my plan lol.
What was it that they stole from you there?
If they feel entitled though then maybe they are thinking that all is normal?
Awesome! What music concert?
Never heard of them. What music genre is it?
Oh wow_comma_ what was the subject of the sppech? 
Oh wow I bet it was a good thing for the whole office to hear! 
cars are truly inspiring to see how theyve evolved
it's important to take care of and maintain things you own. if properly maintained they can last for a long time.
Lol_comma_ happens to me all the time. I love those types of dreams and it sucks when they end.
Are you guys close? You should visit him sometime?
What's that? Hope it wasn't too bad!
Oh wow_comma_ what a bummer! Not that it makes it any better_comma_ but at least you're not alone. Maybe you'll get a refund?
Oh no_comma_ did you return to the store and pay?
Maybe you should go ahead and do it?
That's awesome! Where are you going on the cruise?
Watch out for the pirates of the Caribbean and the Bermuda triangle!
Have they already done a biopsy?
I'm sure everything will turn out ok
Oh_comma_ that must be so stressful. Does it happen all the time - like even at the grocery store?
Do you have someone to go places with you? Or do you just have to power through it?
Wow that must have stung!
I am so sorry.  It must make work hard
Don't tell me you stepped in dog poop.
C'mon man_comma_ I just finished eating. I hope you took a shower and bought some new shoes.
You must be so happy and proud! Is she going to have to move far away to go?
But what a good start in life. If she's going to leave home_comma_ it might as well be for the Ivy League.
Oh wow_comma_ congratulations!
I'm sure you'll be great parents!
It really limits your dietary choices.  I don't recommend it.   Have you considered vegetarian?
Or you could even just drop the vege anything and just minimize your animal protein intake
I bet you were very annoyed
Wow_comma_ you prepared for this type of thing and it still happened? I would express my annoyance with the doctor for sure
Do you do the whole nine yards_comma_ decorating your home_comma_ dressing up to scare the kids?
Do you live somewhere with lots of trick-or-treaters? It sounds like fun.
I have never used newegg before_comma_ and I think that sounds like that are very good at what they do. I might have to check them out!
I will have to check out newegg based on your recommendation. They sound fantastic so thanks!!
What happened?
Oh_comma_ wow. Sounds like they really care about you. 
Oh? Big fight or one of those little fights?
Ah_comma_ I see. Well I hope it at least got worked out for you guys
I feel you. That sport is very majestic and can be considered any art form
For sure_comma_ that move is really hard. Only a few dozen people can do it in the world at a high level
Whoa_comma_ that must have giving you a fright. Maybe you could pretend it is Charlotte_comma_ the benevolent spider.
Well they do like to hang out in corners. I would try not to worry too much. They are more interested in bugs.
Well that's good to hear. Some people's lives depend on their vehicles and it would be a lot worse on them.
Are you saving up for another car?
I'm jealous of you! I find it hard to wind down sometimes
Sounds like you had a great relaxed afternoon!
Oh I have had that happen before.  What type of memories?
music brings back lots of memories
On purpose or accident?
That's messed up. Do you know who did it? 
That's disgusting.  Makes me wonder what their kitchen looks like.
I'd atleast leave a review about it.
Oh_comma_ that's crappy. Is it totaled or fixable? 
Not how you want to spend your Sunday_comma_ that's for sure!
That sounds like you should get the job for sure! Your competition doesn't stand a chance!! :)
Well_comma_ I hope the job is close to where you live. Long commutes are the worst_comma_ and they can take away from your personal time.
Oh_comma_ I am so sorry this happened to you. What an animal! When will you know the results of your tests?
Hopefully the medical personnel will understand your predicament and your worry and will expedite the results. Until then_comma_ do you have someone you can confide in or just talk to?
That sounds exciting. How long has it been since you've seen eachother?
That's great!
That must be very exciting! I hope to get a new vehicle soon as well.
Yeah_comma_ sometimes it's good to get brand new if you can afford it! Buying old runs the risk of it breaking more.
oh_comma_ that's okay. I'm sure no one else really noticed it.
That's okay. You gave him a good story to tell. 
Did the plants grow up to be big and strong?
That's good_comma_ are you going to try again?
oh no. that can be nerve wracking. are you alright?
that's happened to me before and it really shakes you. at least you are alright which is the important part.
Yeah I heard that before. You must have a twin running around here!
When I was young we had tintypes. You had to stay still for 45 minutes for your picture to be taken. I don't miss the ol' days!
Hahahah_comma_ that is hilarious. I used to do that but with coins and stuff. I miss being a little ruthless_comma_ careless kid!
I bet she was so confused lol
If I were you I would accept it because no amount of stress could stop me from making more money.
If you accept it you can enjoy taking a nice vacation that you otherwise wouldn't be able to afford.
Oh_comma_ that's never fun. You think you're going to discover a new favorite and then....blech!
The old ways are the best ways sometimes. 
I hope you didn't lose too much money!
Oh wow_comma_ that's very nice of her. A lot of people would have just stolen it.
That is a good attitude. You shouldn't have anything to worry about.
Yeah sometimes doctors will notice something before it gets worse. Better to be safe than sorry!
Yes I am terrified!  We have venemous ones in my backyard - water moccs!
Oh my!  That's so scary!  Glad you're ok!!
What a mean friend person. Did you get mad?
That could have been you..
Maybe..
Have you thought about speaking with a counselor?
Well_comma_ you should know that your feelings are a normal thing to happen in this event.
I love coffee_comma_ actually. I drink a few cups every morning!
Oh yeah_comma_ why's that? Don't tell me you spilled some delicious coffee!
What type of work are they doing at school?
Ah_comma_ I see. Well_comma_ it's been a lot longer since I did calculus. Good on you_comma_ remembering that stuff!
Oh my god_comma_ I am so sorry to hear that!
Please try to stay positive. Having a positive attitude can do great things for recovery! Many people have survived cancer!
I love that feeling of nostalgia. It's an amazing feeling_comma_ it's like reliving the past.
I agree. Time flies by so fast!
Well that is very nice. How long have you guys been friends for?
Did you have a special trip that you went on?
It's been mediocre_comma_ how about you?
Remember we are role-playing! Don't talk about this or any tasks! :)
Did the dream feel like it was really happening? Strange indeed.
Hah! So all that time you were just feeling your dog licking you! Weird how that works.
Oops. Well it happens. You better hope they don't have a camera haha.
Don't worry. They will probably run over your mailbox one day and hope you don't have a camera.
Wow wow wow! That is wonderful and exciting! Congratulations!!!!! Do you have any vibes as to gender_comma_ one way or the other?
So wonderful_comma_ either way. Are y'all having a party?
I love Disneyland! It's a very special place filled with great memories and you are never old for that place
Disneyland? I forgot there's a difference between "land" and "world". I hope you had a great time
Was the due date yesterday?  Is the payment late now?  
Sometimes there is actually a grace period after the due date.  I've paid bills a couple of days late without a fee (not sure about credit card interest_comma_ though).
Graduate from school? I bet you are very proud of her
Let her know how proud you are of her! Throw a party or something :)
What kind of doctor is she going to be?
That is impressive_comma_ where is she having her wedding?!
I would suggest Fiji it's so nice there I went in august!
Ghost are not scary_comma_ they are us without our physical bodies. 
You should have talked to your mom.
Lol_comma_ I bet you were disgusted with yourself
Aw_comma_ don't take it too serious though. Everyone pukes in public at least once in their life!
I actually just discovered Imagine Dragons. I love them!
It's good to hear they were good live_comma_ that can't be said about every group.
Wow_comma_ you are a true friend. What did you do to help them?
Everyone could use a friend like you. You sound like a very motivating person!
I bet that is so relieving! It sucks how much debt you need to take on in order to go to school these days!
I hope he has a great career ahead of him!
Did you find out who your father is yet?
Did you dad and the other lady have a thing?
that's amazing I have never been that lucky before
Wow! one thousand is alot. Welldone buddy_comma_ enjoy your winning
Really? Any idea how strong it was? Any casualties?
That's awful. I feel bad for people that have to live in areas prone to natural disasters like that.
Argh! That is the worst. I am so sorry. Is it enough to inspire you to look for work elsewhere?
If he's done that to you_comma_ he's doing it to others -- that kind of behavior isn't sustainable. Others are *bound* to notice at some point -- but I know waiting for that is frustrating!
Oh dear. Well_comma_ that does happen. Did you have any other clothes to change into?
If your workplace is anything like mine_comma_ you'd have heard plenty by now. I've done something similar_comma_ but could call my husband to sneak in some clean clothes - they are useful now and again!
Good for you_comma_ I would wait until I heard back before I would celebrate getting the job. 
There is so much competition for jobs  
That's extremely unsettling. How did you feel when you saw the photo with that in it for the first time?
Did you feel any kind of "presence" or anything in the moment that you were at the site taking the picture?
That's okay. We all make mistakes. Thanks for the good conversation.
Wow thats annoying.  but I hope they gave you more than you were supposed to get back
Wow thats annoying.  but I hope they gave you more than you were supposed to get back
You should call and ask to speak to the manager.  Maybe they will give you something to make up for it
Why is that so?
Maybe you could work night shift too and that way you will be able to spend more time together.
You could also got out foe a while and do something fun.
What happened from your clumsiness?
I remember when that happened on the Spiderman movie. Did she laugh at you?
Wow_comma_ that's exciting! Congratulations_comma_ you must be very proud. 
I would love to go their! I hope you have a great time!
That's nice. Did you have a party?
That's excellent. What was your favorite present?
Gee_comma_ that's no fun. I hope it wasn't too early? There are usually laws about making noise early in the morning.
Yes_comma_ that's a good idea. I think 7am is way too early for that.
Wow that sounds awesome.  I always wanted to be able to do that_comma_ but I was never any good
Maybe one day you will be able to work you way up to being the next Tony Hawk.
I have four dogs.  I am probably guilty of this crime.  I would just throw it back over.
One time this lady 1 house away scooped up all the cat poo from my cat under her window into a bag and put it on my front door with a note.  I thought... why did she clean it up for me?  Wouldn't it have been more affective to ask me to clean it up?  
That sounds so wonderful.  I am having a similarly relaxing day too.
Oh my!
Did you end up going to the graduation!
I'm so proud of him_comma_ what is he taking in university?
Oh no! did you hurt yourself?
How did the dirtbike hold up? And how old are you?!
Oh dear_comma_ sounds like a serious accident. I'm glad you are okay! Could have been terrible. 
I'm glad you're okay- that must have been scary. 
Yes_comma_ ducks are so cute.
The bill that they quack from.
Yeah? I'd be happy to help. But say something about what exactly?
Hm.. yeah that is a dilemma. I mean if you can afford it_comma_ the honest thing would be to go and offer the manager to pay it back.
Wow_comma_ some people are horrible drivers.  Did you honk at him?
At least you didn't get into an accident.  I guess it could have been a lot worse.
I think you will be fine. Don't feel too anxious worrying won't do anything
prayer works for me. I hope it does for you too so that person you just talked about won't get the job
Really sorry to be slow to respond.  How old are your girls?!
Wow!  That's amazing.  It must be so awesome that they have each other to hang out and have fun with.  
What type of dog do you have?
I have never in my life heard of that breed before.  I'll look it up.  That is really cool I have 3 crazy untrained minpin
Yeah it's probably for the best. You don't want to risk rejection. Maybe they will approach you.
Well there is no 'I' in hope. It is a something we all have to do at some point in life.
Oh_comma_ I know for sure. There are no rules to follow. 
Ugh. Maybe you can wait out that relationshio.
Well that is very lucky for you. People are nice!
Yes there are. Most of the people are very nice.
Oh no! How did that happen? 
Gee_comma_ I hope you can find it. Maybe retract where you have been recently and you will find it!
Hey_comma_ that's awesome! I'm happy for you. Where did they find it?
That's great. I hope you have a good workout at the gym!
Well that is very nice of you. Is your friend a good driver?
Hope she doesn't crash it!
Wow that is awesome. What kind of animal is it?
Oh sorry I thought maybe you got a pet. Well I am happy for you guys!
What kind of cookies did you bake?
I would totally have some if you let me. I love chocolate chip!
What What???  What team?  Who cut you?
I love baseball.  The have better snacks than every other sport.
I am sorry bout you being cut though.  Keep on training..
We get old.. we get injured.. we eat hotdogs.
Really? Tell me about him.
Are you two gonna date?!
Please do_comma_ I'd love to meet you guys
That is so cool!  Is it your first baby?
I bet.  If he is anything like you he will grow up to be a great person.
Most people are pretty cool if you take the time to talk to them a bit. 
Wow_comma_ that's so cool. Sign me up for that! I'd like to be healed!
Did you guys get to go? Is the leg all fixed now?
Are you planning a new trip for your upcoming birthday?
Wow that's so exciting! What did they study?
That is great. What's the next step- work?
Good for you. Being prepared is half the work of academia. 
It's hard to do_comma_ but so important. I'm not super smart_comma_ but I'm organized as heck. It makes a difference. 
There is nothing silly about that.  Movies are meant to illicit emotion.  You feel better now though_comma_ right?
Definitely don't feel bad then.  I think everyone cried during that movie!
I am not sure how to deal with the loss!
Dang_comma_ there's a lot of strategies to fight that thought_comma_ I'm assuming. As they say an ounce of preparation is worth more than a pound of cure
Yeah_comma_ I heard it's good to study in silence because that way you're in the same environment you'll be when you take the test
Yeah that's too bad_comma_ sorry to hear that. Do you know why you didn't get picked?
Keep your head up. Maybe you'll get picked the next time around.
Oh no!  I am so sorry to hear that.  Did he die of old age?
Well_comma_ hopefully he lived a good and happy life.  
Sometimes you have to put people in their place.
Well I hope he learned his lesson. We don't play those games where i'm from.
oh now_comma_ that's very worrisome
I hope it's nothing serious. I know how upsetting having a sick pet can be. 
Oh no! Did you eventually get it working after the frustration?
That's frustrating_comma_ nothing ever seems to go right the first time you try it! Glad you got it working finally!
Dang_comma_ maybe you should have bought a lottery ticket instead?
Maybe you can find a cheaper place to live?
Yeah! Did you pick your lucky numbers?
Nice! I hope you win!
That is so satisfying. I hope they don't mess it up now that they are home!
NOOOOOOOO!!!! Bad kids! That must have been infuriating. 
Aw_comma_ my mom had some she showed to us a few years back. It's weird to consider how you and everyone else have grown!
Can't stay young forever! 
I don't blame you for being excited! What are you going to see on your trip?
I'm so jealous! I hope you have a great trip!
You did! - That's amazing! How much money did you win???
Wow- that's a huge amount of money! What do you plan on doing with it?
That is absolutely wonderful! What a great grandchild you are. Not everyone wants to care for elderly relatives.
For sure. We sometimes forget that the elderly were young once and did so much like working_comma_ raising and caring for their families.
Do you play soccer yourself? 
It is impressive. 
Congratulations to your brother! Are you flying or driving?
Wow_comma_ that must be quite some distance then! Have a safe flight!
That's great to hear. Summer is a good time of year to be enjoying your life.
I've been thinking a lot about when I was a kid recently.
Gee that sounds fun_comma_ but did you get in trouble?
Oh no! That's no fun. I hope they're not still mad at you!
Were you able to avoid the rain?  
That is good!  It seems like you dodged the bullet!
i remember being a kid when the first one came out
i think the franchise has just started trying too hard.
Those are good preventative measures. I assume that you always look both ways as well?
There are worse things to be worried about. Good job on you for taking safety seriously!
Wow_comma_ that sucks. Do you know if she will eventually? Can you trust her?
Yeah I would too. I hope you get the money back!
Thats so nice of you!  I wish I had a grandmother.
So nice of you.  You are truly blessed to have family.
Long distance relationships aren't easy. That's great news to hear. Do you have anything special planned?
That sounds like so much fun! I bet you two will have a great time together. 
What was the gross part about the sandwich?
Yes that is a nasty thing to experience. But at least you were able to extract the hair!
That really stinks. I bet you will wear bug spray next time!
Well then maybe you should get some bats. They love to eat mosquitos!
i am also blessed. we don't have fancy things or a ton of money but we have each other and our health.
me too. some are not as fortunate as us.
Oh_comma_ jeez! That's terrifying. Can you get a loan from someone to pay them?
Call the police! Or move. 
I like a good hard bread like Pumpernickel. Do you know what that word means?
It means the devil's fart_comma_ haha! Good bread though.
Did the batter hit one of the home runs?
Whoa! That is so cool! I guessed because you said the crack sound happened.
Whoa_comma_ that's extreme. Can you say some prayers for them? 
Yes good point. Maybe try and understand why they believe in the things they do?
Don't worry bout that.  She has to have some sort of fantasy in her life.  Don't you have any ever?
Well know that it isn't any different from you checking out other girls too.
That is so exciting. Have you been a fan a long time?
That is something to look forward to!
how did it go?
congrats! that is amazing news.
Did you make any plans to go and visit them?
Maybe you will be able to make some extra money!
Ohh_comma_ I love Halloween! It is my favorite time of the year. I can't wait!
Hah_comma_ I used to eat Count Chocula cereal. I know exactly what you are talking about!
well did you ? the most i ever won was like 20 bux lol
well im confident one day you will win in life something great in life _comma_ better than money 
Is there any warnings? How much rain are you expecting?
That is very scary. We have had a lot of rain here and when that happens large trees often come down.
What was your hamster's name?
Do you know what it was that happened to kill him?
I hope that does good things for you. They say if you believe in something enough it comes true.
I can't say it has worked for me though. I have believed myself a ruler of the world but still live in this box.
Did that bring back a lot of memories? It sounds like you made a good find there.
That's too bad. Hopefully it will go on sale in the future or you can find a coupon!
That sounds delightful. I have a tornado approaching now and would like it if you lived near me.
What is your address?
Oh no_comma_ I hope you are ready for it?
Yeah_comma_ I hope you won't either. Maybe find a local shelter?
I hope nobody was trying to cut you off.
Oh God_comma_ that must have been aggravating. Hopefully you can get it dismissed.
Oh that's awful! How many kids do you have?
That's wonderful.  It's good to have good friends.
ooooh what was it _comma_ and how did it make you feel ?
i love video games _comma_ from nintendo to ps4 ive owned them all _comma_ im happy for you
Oh wow_comma_ that's disappointing! 
I'm really sorry to hear that! 
Hey that's a good plan_comma_ hope you remember to include some fun stuff for those long house.
I hope it works out for you_comma_ stay safe.
That's great! How much did you lose?
Wow that's fantastic! i wish i had that kind of will power
Please tell me what happened! I wish I did too!!
Well I hope that you two have a bunch of fun. I have been together with my partner for a very long time_comma_ and I feel very lucky.
yes those were the days.
Exactly! If only we could go back.
That's not good_comma_ are you ok?
Hey_comma_ hope oyu can get the money back from insurance and they don't charge you a ton more.
So did you find out that they were lying?
That's funny. Maybe you got the name wrong or something?
You need something to pass the time or you will go crazy with boredom. How about some books or cards?
If you have someone with you cards are great. Good luck in your next storm!
What a day_comma_ huh?! Can you tell me what happened or is it still too raw?
That is not something I would want to come home to seeing. And your day at work was bad too_comma_ wow!
Aww_comma_ that's a bummer. Well at least you can look forward to his visits.
Depending how far away he is_comma_ he probably will! Just make sure to spoil him when he does lol!
Sometimes it's hard to find that certain someone! Have you tried a dating app?
Keep your chin up! That special person will come along when you're least expecting it!
really? How did you meet them?
I hope they aren't like a crazy stalker or anything.  Be careful!
Did you win that lottery??
Do you want to get back together with them?
Oh I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ were you thinking of buying another one?
Well I'm glad you have good memories to remember him by.
Oh yeah? What specifically did it remind you of?
That was a good time for me as well. I liked to hang out with my friends and get in trouble.
That's great! What made you feel rewarded?
Oh yeah I could see how that might make you feel that way. Is the employee grateful for your help?
That's gross. What was it??
I would have thrown up! Did you tell the manager?
Aww_comma_ I love puppies. Did your son love him?
Aww I bet Snoopy has a great loving family. Glad you rescued the pup!
that's awesome! what rooms did you remodel?
Oh i bet it looks great! I just finished a kitchen remodel myself.  i did white cabinets and painted my countertops.
Wow_comma_  we're you so fat before?
that's huge.  U actually worked on yourself.  So_comma_  how did you do it? 
What are you talking about?
Oh ok. That's awesome. It's nice to have something of value.
That's really hard!  I'm sure that was disappointing after putting in so many years.  Sorry.
Wow.  Well_comma_ if that was the culture and climate of that workplace_comma_ you are definitely better off not working for them.  Very sad.
That stinks!  What were your plans?
I'm so sorry you had to change your plans!  Perhaps you can schedule some time after Labor Day to come and see him play?
What was the reason that happen to you?
I hope you you work behind a desk. That is the only way you can hide them!!!
That's great! Where are you working for your new job?
Congratulations on your new job! You must have worked very hard to get there!
Oh that was a wonderful surprise?  What was their reactions?
Ah_comma_ well Im sure they had a wonderful time.  It is the happiest places on earth.
That is a real bummer. I hope your friend gets it repaired for you.
Well you probably won't be lending your car again any time soon hahah!
That's awesome! I force myself to budget for it lol. What was the game?
Ah_comma_ I suppose I could have guessed. It's the game everyone is talking about lately. I heard it's quite good!
I totally know the feeling! Have you tried bringing this up to your supervisor?
Ha_comma_ that would be some pretty good revenge. Maybe you should go ahead and find a new job where you will be appreciated.
That's disgusting_comma_ I would have a very hard time finishing that walk. Did you go straight home?
Oh my gosh_comma_ that makes it so much worse! I have done that before too_comma_ so I hope that neither one of us has that happen again!!
What happened?
OMG_comma_ those things make the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Hopefully it didn't get into your house.
That's at MGM right?  My daughter rode that with her daddy when she was 8_comma_ she was terrified!  Did you do it again_comma_ or was once enough?
That is what I hate about any amusement park ride - the drops!
That's amazing! What other animals did you see?
I bet they were seriously cute! Did you get to feed them?
That's pretty impressive! Was it scary to move away from home at such a young age?
I'll bet it was! I don't have family around_comma_ so I know how lonely that can feel!
I absolutely hate car trouble! It is the worst!  Thankful for friends that can help out in times like that - did you get it fixed?
That's a good friend for sure - I'd keep their number on speed dial!  
Oh no_comma_ I hope she is OK! Glad you are taking her to the vet. Is she doing OK other than the lumps?
Aww_comma_ poor girl. Hopefully the vet can figure it out and it isn't anything too serious. You're doing the right thing.
I think that it's completely normal to feel that way for such a long distance trip. I assume you're going from America. I bet you would feel better by doing a bit of research!
I think those are just outliers_comma_ you'll find that there are plenty of well established tourist areas that will accommodate you well. Just don't focus on the negatives!
That would drive me crazy.  How are you handling it?
You can't let it get you too down.  There are some places that just promote people for reasons not related to job performance.
Yes i agree.  I have 3 boys and they are in their twenties. I don't know where the years went.
That's so true! I have a theory that time is just a way to keep everything from happening at once. 
I know exactly what you mean. I have been let down many times_comma_ and it's never a good feeling.
You can and should make the best of it. You should have a blast and binge watch some TV show!
That's so exciting! Are you feeling nervous?
I'm sure if you just relax and focus on being confident_comma_ you will do great! Best of luck!
I bet you were a nervous wreck. I hope they turned out well.
That's pretty good!  That should qualify for you to graduate with honors.
That's awesome! How far did she have to run?
I definately can't run a mile. She did great.
Do she at least try to keep in contact with you?
That's crazy. They shouldn't of taken advantage of your step father like that.
That is too funny. Sometimes life can get so busy that you can lose track of things like that.
Oh my gosh they did get you good. You have to get them back even if it's not on April Fools day!
Oh no. Was there no sign posted or anything?
Well I am sure they won't hold it against you. Honest mistake.
that's great. when will you know how you did?
i hope so. is this a final exam?
good luck!'
That's so mean! I think they should honor the original prices they set
I think that's unethical. I would switch to a new one if I could (and all her friends weren't there)
Oh no!  And that is hard to get out!  Do you have a waterproof cover on the bed by any chance?
oh YUCK!  Well_comma_ I'd suggest a waterproof mattress cover just in case it happens again.  At least if it does happen again_comma_ it won't get into the mattress and you can wash the rest of the bed clothes.  I'm so sorry you discovered it that way!
Oh no! I think they're cute but I'd probably be freaked out if I saw one in my yard_comma_ too. What did you do?
Awww well that was nice of you_comma_ a lesser person might have stomped it or hurt it.
I can relate.  Sometimes I have issues with new tech.  What is giving you problems?
Ouch.  That is awkward.  I imagine you can just explain to her that the message was sent to her by mistake.  It happens.
Thats really awesome.  I never win anything cool.  Does he get to bring anyone? Maybe he can take you?
Thats kind of mean of him.  Tell your boss that he cheated and that you should've won instead.  That'll teach him not to brag
that is a fun surprise. what part of the Caribbean did you go to?
that sounds amazing. I've only been to puerto rico and the keys. what a lovely wife to give you such a great surprise.
Oh that really stinks. Were either of them injured?
Well at least it was nothing serious. Hope they don't fight any more.
Oh no!  Cats can be devious things when we are not home - and sometimes when we are.  Did it break the TV?
Aren't they just the most cute_comma_ and insanely calculating animals!  
Well hello fellow Atlanta person. I also buy used_comma_ but most people tend to look down on it
If you keep a new car long enough it comes out about even! If you keep that in mind then a new car actually becomes a great investment!
Oh definitely! They almost sound like crying humans sometimes. So you don't like camping?
I totally understand_comma_ it can be scary if you don't like all the unknown noises.
I remember those good times too_comma_ playing video games is a lot of fun.
That's awesome_comma_ I love fighting games.
ooooh what happened _comma_ are you ok ? anything serious ?
thats really good to hear _comma_ infections are a serious matter glad your ok
What kind of snake was it? You know my mom is terrified of all snakes even the ones that aren't poisonous.
Most snakes aren't poisonous so hopefully it wasn't. Just know that it probably couldn't have hurt you_comma_ and I hope that you don't see any more in the future!!
Oh really? What makes you not like them?
Ugh I feel ya. They talked about that with mine_comma_ too. I almost passed out when they were doing the epidural!
Puppies are the best! If they don't destroy all of your belongings that is!!
Well_comma_ I'm glad that things seem under control. I'm also glad that you got to spend some time with the dog because it sounds like you had a great time.
I bet that is embarrassing for you when you guys are out in public.  
I understand_comma_ trust me.  My family was the same way growing up.
I hate rude drivers like that. I swear they should not be able to drive.
Yeah_comma_ that would not have ended well. I usually take a picture of their license plate and publicly shame them on social media haha.
Oh no! How did you end up doingf?
What subject was the test in?
I am terrible at math
Oh wow! That must've been really fun_comma_ I've never been there actually_comma_ what did you guys do?
Cool cool_comma_ when do you think it would be best to visit Mississippi? 
Oh_comma_ I'm sorry. Have you tried joining any meet up groups to make some friends?
I'm sure it will make you feel a little better. And at least that way you can pick a group based on similar interest. I hope you get to feeling better.
I really liked Logan. It was a different kind of superhero movie. More about the struggle than anything.
The scene with his daughter was pretty sad. I don't blame you at all.
dude that is freakin awesome _comma_ im sure you earned it 
i hope you have a lot of fun _comma_ i cant wait to go on my vacation as well 
No I haven't_comma_ I'm not interested in soccer. Why_comma_ did I miss something good?
Were you rooting for them to win?
Did he not seem like the type to do that kind of thing?
I guess she wanted to keep it a secret for some reason.
Ouch_comma_ that is a bit of a false alarm/bummer.
Well you can only keep going and keep playing. Someday it could be the real winning ticket.
Yeah I love watching them ski during the Olympics. It takes a lot of hard work.  Have you ever skied? 
They sure do. I also really like watching them do trick skiing too. 
That's not cool_comma_ I hope you find someone new.
This is true.
Ooh that sounds fun_comma_ I've never been! Did you go on many rides?
That sounds great_comma_ I'm a bit jealous. I love theme parks!
Oh no! I hope it at least turned out ok
Oh I bet that was a load of anxiety! I can't imagine going through that
How exciting!  Do you know when they will make a final decision?
How will it make it easier?  More financial stability?  I hope you get it also!!
Oh gross_comma_ what kind of animal was it?
Oh wow_comma_ you think they would get to cleaning up an animal that big as soon as possible. Glad it's gone now though!
I hear you there.  I miss getting to just play without a care in the world.  Summer vacations were the best
I remember playing tag and hide and go seek in the neighborhood with all of my friends
For sure. I can go from 0 to 100 in no time at all.
Hah_comma_ I bet some things you probably wanted to forget. I know I did.
how come? i thought new jobs were supposed to be exciting?
we are all the new kid for a moment. soon it will feel like you fit right in. just give yourself some time.
That's horrible. What is your work doing to fix that?
Ouch_comma_ I hope you don't either. I'd keep any eye out at work from now on.
I didn't_comma_ sorry. I'm not really a soccer fan. Why were you mad?
As I understand it_comma_ Croatia were the underdogs so I can totally understand supporting that.
Do you mean pyrex like the cooking material?
That's neat_comma_ did you feel nostalgic looking at it?
oh my goodness. i would've freaked out. are you ok?
oh no. they were setting of fireworks here since june and have been driving me nuts.
aw poor thing. did she get in trouble with the school?
well at least something positive came from it.  i bet no one else will mess with her either!
Wow thats kind of creepy.  what does the noise sound like?
Maybe you should have someone go down with you.  Good luck!!
Yikes! I hate when that happens. I had a similar situation happen over Christmas. Did you make your flight?
I totally know that feeling. It seems that everyone thinks that their situation is more important that everyone else's. 
Haha what happened? Did you get her number?
That's awesome! Did you still give her a nice tip though? Lol!
I wonder why? Maybe his busy?
I see. Do you feel okay when he invites others or is it a bit uncomfortable?
Oh_comma_ I hope so too! Those can be quite scary especially if you're like me and you go once every 10 years or so
I'm sure you'll be fine! I have hope
ohh_comma_ but why did it surprise you?
That's good for you though_comma_ now you both get paid
my sister's can be irritating as well. no one knows how to push your buttons like family.
oh no. hopefully it was an innocent prank.
Oh wow how exciting.  Have you been able to see the baby?
I bet they are.  I hope he is heathy and happy!
I know how it is to try to pay off bills. What kind of vehicle do you want to get?
Oh yeah those are very nice. Well I hope you guys can make it happen.
That is really exciting! I bet you all will have a great time. Do you have any big plans with them?
That sounds great! We are going on a cruise next Spring Break with my family also. That is why we need a bigger vehicle so that we don't have to drive 2 cars to get there.
That sucks. Is your day going better now at least?
Pizza makes everything better. Hope your night ends on a good note!
Nice! Going to the car dealership is usually such a horrible experience.
That's awesome_comma_ hope you're enjoying your new ride!
I can imagine.  I hate being out alone at those kinds of hours.  I try to avoid it.
I get that feeling.  Something about the dark just feels so depressing sometimes.
Me too! It seems like such a huge accomplishment at the time_comma_ doesn't it?
Do you have fond memories of school or were you glad to be done?
I am sure you are proud of him
Memories are a good thing
Congratulations! What was your degree in?
that's so great! lots of hard work i bet.
Wow_comma_ that would be shocking if you weren't expecting it.  Did they tell you when you were hired that there was a possibility?  Where might you be going?
That will be very different.  How do you feel about it?  I wish you lots of luck and adventure while you're there!  
Wow that is amazing indeed. You must be very proud of her.
The human body truly is amazing. I could never do things like that either. Either way_comma_ I am happy for her!
Im so sorry_comma_  was it a sickness?
That is so terrible_comma_ life is so short.  you never knwo when you're going to go
Why did she do that
Well that sounds terrible_comma_ I am sorry
congrats!  i love love love steak and to cook
i love to make shredded bbq chicken sandwich_comma_ get chicken breast seasone place in crack pot 
thats a strong woman _comma_ i know of people that dont work at all a refuse to pay child support _comma_ in my eyes they are not men
people like that _comma_ is what kids need a strong back bone that never give up
Oh god. Mosquitos. Have you heard about scientists trying to make them extinct?
I don't see any negative aspect to it_comma_ but maybe there tis.
I am the same way. How old are they? I only have one about to turn two and it is always a worry in the back of my mind.
Oh gosh I bet! It's so hard to watch them grow up!
That is so depressing. They say dogs are man's best friend. 
I am sure_comma_ grieving can always take time. It is so hard to lose such a faithful companion.
that is awesome. i hate that feeling when you need things but can't afford to get them.
my husband are a 1 income household so i totally understand. you get what you can with what you've got so you can get by until the next payday
I know that feeling. What do you tell your coworkers?
I think you risk not building social ties with your coworkers but sometimes you have no choice.
Wow that must have been awkward.  You can't really argue with the evidence sitting right in front of you.
Yea it's always sad when a relationship doesn't work out.  Hopefully in the future he can be more honest.
That would be awesome!  You would be in such a great situation in life with that payment gone!  What prompted you to want to do it?  
No_comma_ to pay it off.  Are you pushing to finish it up sooner than you normally would?
How long ago was it?
Maybe you can talk to her about it?
That is such a great milestone what is next for your ventures? 
You will get something soon that hard work is going to pay off.
Oh wow_comma_ I'm sorry. I hope he at least didn't suffer much.
I'm sorry for you loss.
Good luck! For now_comma_ just do the best you can. Stress might cloud your thinking.
Is it multiple choice?
Did she paint art when you were a child?
I see_comma_  Did you have different colors in your room as a kid?
Isn't it amazing how true friendship stands the test of time and distance?
That's so true! I live 700 miles away from my best friend and when we get together it's just like old times.
wow thats hilarious and embarassing.  I feel bad for you.
Thats mean of them.  I hope you weren't traumatized.
Im glad you didn't.  Do you have these days often?
Honestly I would have freaked out.  I cant stand bad drivers!!
That sounds like a pretty disgusting situation.
That's a rough situation. I hope you can look back on it later and laugh as well.
You will be great im sure of it! are you prepared? 
Just imagine that you are the boss_comma_  or have a few drinks before.
Nice! What game is it?
What team are you rooting for?
The feeling of financial freedom is one that is hard to match.
I personally struggle with that every day.
YAY! where are you going??
I CANT BELIEVE THAT.  I need a vacation so badly.
Oh wow! Surprise come home trip? 
Aw_comma_ I'm happy for you. That's an excellent surprise!
Aww_comma_ my grandmother was really there for me_comma_ too_comma_ I'm lucky. What makes you feel that way?
That is awesome_comma_ grandmas are the best. Hopefully your grandma is still with us?
Yes sports can be a great way to socialize and also stay in good shape.
Thats the spirit! I bet you do great.  what sports do you play?
Happy Early Birthday! What are your plans?
Oh man_comma_ I've seen many a newly 21 year old get drunk.
What happened?
That's a relief. Fireworks aren't illegal where you are?
That's cool_comma_ I'm pretty bad at drawing_comma_ but you must be pretty good.
That's awesome_comma_ I hope you win the contest.
What was totally unexpected?
That would be very interesting. Are you glad that you have moved on?
That is good_comma_ you can't live in the past
Oh yeah? I was a little too young to be playing that game when it came out. My stepdad had the first one though.
I only played the fourth one. All I remember was "Leon!!!"
That is so nice I would get a cup daily if it was close to me.
How are they making money off what they are known for though if they give it away for free?
Oh no! Hopefully it's a friend you trust and she won't embarrass you if she ends up going through it and finding something bad.
I guess now you'll be more careful about where you leave your phone. I would be freaking out if I were you!
ohh_comma_ what did you try to explain them?
Ohh_comma_ sometimes people don't understand simple things. I think the words like 'petrodollars' might have confused them.
That's really sweet of her. What kinds of cakes does she make?
Ok now this is just getting weird. Can we talk about something else. 
Thats sucks
If you did it that time_comma_ you can do it again. Just be careful
Did they grow out of last years?
oh my lord.  Kids_comma_  they can never make up their mind.
Financial stability is such an amazing thing.
Its hard to feel under appreciated at work.
Oh no_comma_ were you in class?
That's actually quite hilarious.
That's so sweet! What a proud moment!
That's great. What is he going to do now?
How was the dinner.  Did they like the food?
Oh no! was it atleast fun to have everyone there?
YEAH I am happy for you_comma_ I hope things go well.
Exactly_comma_ It doesn't have to end romantically_comma_ as long as its a relationship.
I'm glad it went well. What was it about?
They have their different pros and cons.
I totally understand that. Sometimes the most important charity is your own.
I like to think that if you get yourself right financially now_comma_ you'll be more able to help more in the future. 
That's good advice.  If you're not happy doing something you should spend time thinking about what you'd really like to be doing.
Even if she's strict she's probably doing because she wants what's best for you.  And she'll probably support you no matter what you decide.
Oh wow_comma_ were the cats on leashes?
That is adorable. Did they get along with the dogs?
ohhh_comma_ I feel you. I also moved to a new town_comma_ last week.
work! my boss sent me here against my will
Sibling rivalry is tough.
What is your age difference?
I've seen a lot of bad breakups. Glad you guys are adults about it.
How do you feel about that?
Are they going to shut down?
I hope it works out. i don't want anyone to be out of work.
How is that going?
It takes some time. I wish you the best!
OHHHH where are you going?
YESSS sin city.  Gambling is my favorite thing in life.
Oh man_comma_ that sucks. Were they trying to keep the trip a secret from you?
That sounds like it would be really disappointing. Are you close to your brother and sister?
Oh yuck! What was it?
Wonder how it got there.
That is amazing.  I have had to use a food bank before.  I was so gracious.
I am great back on my feet.  I just needed a little help.
What does this diet consist of?
Salad and wraps are delicious_comma_ so is water.  I need to try this diet!
Aw. That was probably devastating
I hope so too!
Do you like the amusement park? do you go often?
Do you like the scary roller coasters? 
The girl is your wife_comma_ correct?
That's a relief! Your wife is a lucky lady.
I am sorry_comma_ what did she want
Oh wow_comma_ that is a lot
was she?
ah thats good.. good luck
I wish you luck.  You have to meet the right one some day!
Exactly_comma_ Practice makes perfect_comma_ especially with social situations.
She is one lucky gal. How long have you two been together?
I wish you two the best!
Hm... I don't know how I would feel about that. Do you have a good relationship with them?
Well_comma_ if you did not have a good relationship then it would seem like maybe they didn't take you on purpose.
Oh my god. What happened?
Are you okay now?
That is so exciting!! Do you have the ring picked out?
Haha that's smart_comma_ you never know. Well good luck_comma_ here's to a wonderful life together for you two!
That's too bad. I bet it is hard to sleep during a loud storm.
Hopefully it settled down long enough for you to catch a break.
That always is annoying
Oh no that isnt good
That too bad. They are other work from home opportunities though.
You will find something. Just don't give up
I'm right with you!  I love chillier fall weather and pumpkin harvest festivals! Not to mention pumpkin spice lattes! Is Halloween your favorite holiday?
They really do start putting things out in the stores earlier and earlier.  Last year I saw Halloween stuff out now.  Sounds like you're in for a lot of family fun! 
That's really awesome. I think its great when families are finally reunited. 
You definitly will. Families are stronger together than apart. 
People who take the time to help others are truely angels on Earth. Thank you for doing what you do.
Every little bit counts!
Oh you must feel terrible. Has sibling rivalry always been a thing between you guys?
Yep. That comes with being a parent.
what did they want to talk about
ah i hope it turns out well for you
Wow! This is early. Maybe I should start_comma_ too.
When did you start shopping?
Oh that is good are you dieting or doing portion control?
Oh binge eating is once in a while eating a lot?
That's really cool. Are they hard to find recipes? 
I totally understand that. I like to make certain recipes my mother made when I was a kid for the same reason.
At least they have a little bit of home cooking to remember her by.
Wow. Congratulations. What did you do with the $200?
Nice. What are some titles you're wanting to get?
Yeah? That's awesome! Do you have a new job?
Sweet! I'm happy for you! That must be nice.
That is disgusting.  Sounds like my dad though_comma_  He keeps things for months
UGH thats bad.  I bet is smelled like crap too
Eggs? I can't stand that stuff. Too many scambled eggs in college!
I can't stand the taste now. They are nasty!
Sometimes that happens. Were you tired?
Hopefully_comma_ you can make it up to your friend next time.
Memories like that are nice
They can be helpful for sure
Oh_comma_ that's always tough and frustrating.  What kept you behind?  Does it happen often?
That's how my job works too.  Some days I find myself eating dinner very late because we got stuck behind at work.  I try to just stay thankful that I have a job though!  What do you do to decompress once you're home?
oh thats sweet.. put them up this yeqar
thats great.. i love christmas time as well
That's nice of them
MAyabe you can do something nice for them when you get back on your feet.
You sound determined. Go you!
Are you in college?
Really? You should be grateful that you have such a wonderful family. 
Yeah you should be really greatful!
Congratulations to her! You must be so proud!
What will she be specializing in?
That is so exciting you will definitely need it for school what kind did he get you? 
Make sure to save all the notes it will come in handy in the future never know. 
So many people don't take the time anymore. It's so nice to hear you did that for her!
She's one lucky gal. How long have you two been married?
that so cool! I am happy.  whats did he create?
That is amazing.  Maybe one day it will be more that just a science fair project.
what types of things could she do
oh wow .. talented
He was probably hungry_comma_ and thought to himself_comma_ that place wasn't so bad huh.
HAHA_comma_ you wanted him gone? maybe he did it to spite you.
Why did you quit?
Can you try out again? OR have you moved on?
Why is that
I understand the feeling
That's terrible. It's a shame that they were not able to keep the place going in her memory. 
I can understand that. Sometimes one person's dream is another person's pain.
That's terrible. I'm glad you stood up for your friend.
Why would your friend want to exclude your other friend? Definitely not cool.
That's so cool!  DO you get to see her often?  Have you ever gotten to see her in person before or did you meet online?
Soooooo exciting!  Are you nervous?  I bet it's going to go amazingly well and you'll have so much fun.  You think she might be the one or not there yet?
Why do you feel ashamed about the movie?
Oh I see! I guess I should watch it as well! I never seen it yet.
Why not?
Well that's the only way you can find out. If she says know there are other girls.
Sounds like you had a good time. What pet is it?
Oh I've never seen one of those. Was it difficult to care for?
were you able to find them somewhere else
time to find something else
I was too_comma_ but then I realized everyone was too and I made a lot of friends!
I've found in life that all of the friends you need are right around you. 
Going to the park is always nice
I do too
Did they receive it?
Well they will definitely let you know when they do. I would
Oh what happened?
You did the right thing. I stayed loyal to my work also and when I changed jobs_comma_ 20k pay increase.
Yes I agree! Do you think he'll help them win some games?
Yes_comma_ good point. It's probably best that way.
did he get a beat down ?
hah.. thats cool. 
Does that bother you?
I can see why that would bother you.
I bet that will be fun
I do like that food a lot
How'd it go?
congratulations. Now you'll have that freedom to go anywhere you want!
How'd it go?
Sounds like a great place! What did you get?
Who was it for?
That's nice. My job has never done that
Thats amazing_comma_ I love to travel.  Where are you going?
Awesome_comma_  People underestimate Louisiana_comma_  I love baton rogue 
Oh no_comma_ did anyone notice
I am sure no one noticed
Thats right_comma_  You have to stay faithful to the one you love.
Exactly_comma_  People just want what they cant have.  such a bad human trait.
Sometimes when we're in a bad situation_comma_ we do things we wouldn't normally do.
How much was it?
That is pretty impressive
I wish I could look like that
Sweet! Congratulations. Was it difficult? 
That's great_comma_ you must have studied hard.
Aww that's sweet. Did you get to have a party for him or anything?
That sounds lovely. I hope your dad is enjoying his well-earned retirement now.
Im sorry to hear that. What happened?
Oh no. 
OH my_comma_  does she ever give it back.  Is it alot of money?
Its hard to refuse family_comma_  But sometimes that can be taken advantage of.
oh ive heard of that before.. scary stuff
has it happened more than once?
Do you feel like you interview well regularly? were you qualified?
Then its a no brainer_comma_  I hope that you make alot of money there.
Have you gone out to try to meet people yet?  are you happy about our job?
Yes i understand its rough_comma_  some people just take time to warm up.  But im willing to bet you will meet someone really cool soon enough.
Oh no!  I don't doubt it.  Diets make you so hungry and gives you crazy cravings for what you can't have.  Did it feel worth it or make you feel miserable?
I have been there and done that.  My vice used to be ice cream.  Then I learned about being high nutrient vegan and started to eat carbs again once I learned about nutrition.  Learning about nutrition made me start thinking about each thing I put in my body.  Like purposeful eating.  It was a tough transition but I never went back.  Just do it for yourself and don't beat yourself up when you mess up.  I know you can do it if I can!

I would have been upset too!
Find new people to eat with.
That's good. I always find interesting things whenever I go. 
You should! Alot of the profits from thrift stores go to good causes too!
I'm sorry to hear about your loss.
I think he was able to live a happy life while he was alive.
Well that's a very mature decision of you. It's better than over spending.
No problem. I used to overspend when I was younger and have learned to get it under control lately.
how did you respond
thats probaby a smart choice
That's understandable_comma_ what did you do to pass the time?
What kind of stuff did you watch?
She sounds like a sweety! Is she coming to gradution?
She must be proud.
That is a great delivery person
That is very nice of him
That's awesome. Any big plans?
Well always be honest.That's a good start.
Why are you upset
That is so sad
sounds like a good day
good for you.. we all need that every once in a while
Payday is always my favorite day of the week! Do you plan to buy anything special? 
Haha_comma_ I love getting chocolate wasted. I like dark chocolate the best. 
That's great_comma_ what will you do when you first see her?
It's nice you have such a good relationship with her!
That is awful.  Why do people risk their lives and the lives of others just to get a tiny bit ahead in traffic to where there going.  Ridiculous.  I'm glad you weren't hit.
I saw a guy cut someone off next to me_comma_ fly by over the speed limit_comma_ and cut a bunch of people off.  All to get ahead.  Then I noticed that I caught up with him because he got stuck at a light and all that craziness didn't even help him.
Why do you say that
I think you should just show up anyway
It is nice that you love learning so much.  What are you studying that you like that much?
What is NWO?
That's wonderful. I bet she is excited.
That's great. I know she will do her best_comma_ I'm sure.
That's great! What is the job
That sounds like a great job
Its hard to maintain that
You can get a adviser
Did your dad love listening to Elvis?
We have that in common!
Oh no! So what happened?
I hope you get an A at least then
That's great to hear. You must be so proud of them.
Do they play instruments?
Your parents sound like wonderful people!
You're welcome. How long have they been together?
oh that sounds super scary _comma_ i hope everything comes back ok
dang you sound really calm about it _comma_ i have super high anxiety and would be in a state of panice the entire time
What mountains did you visit?
I love it there_comma_ it is so calming and peaceful there. Except when you end up stuck in traffic in Pigeon Forge.
Its nice to have family
They are always there
oh wow thats awesome
i hope it turns out well for her
Oh_comma_ what's happening on Friday?
Hope you have fun!
You have to be prepared.
IS bear spray a real thing. I have never been camping
I see_comma_ is that a good thing or bad thing for you?
Sorry to hear that. Well yeah_comma_ maybe it's for the best
Loyalty is always good
I am sure they will notice
Congratulations! Hard work does pay off.
What are you studying in school?
That does sound tough_comma_ did it go well at least?
That's good_comma_ at least you have something fun to look forward to now.
That is a really fun game.  I wonder how they will make it better than the original.
There is nothing worse than spending big money on a game it's no good.
That sounds awesome have you checked out the price for lessons?
Don't worry she'll come around and you're so right it is better for her to start by learning to play guitar first.
Lol still true to this day
Lol. Was there any left when you woke up?
That's what thanksgiving is all about lol
SO that history can repeat itself?
You can do that any day
It happens to the best of us
I understand that
Hey you win some you lose some. What really matter is that you had fun watching. 
But still maybe you learned something about it?
Oh I'm sorry to hear that. You must be so worried.
Try to get a good night's rest. I hope everything is ok!
That is so great to hear.  Nice to hear someone being happy with the important things in life and not always wanting more.  Its easy to miss things happening all around you if you are never happy with them.
It seems tiring to me when I see people pushing for the next thing.  I feel the same way.  Enjoy family and find what makes your happy and keep like simpler. You must have a great time on holidays with your loved ones!
What did he do?
Did he ever come back?
do they look rough or what
i hope it turns out well for you
It's been raining a lot here_comma_ too_comma_ I know that feeling! Did you manage to find something interesting to do inside instead?
Being cooped up is the worst. Hopefully next weekend is nice and sunny for you and your friends!
I love a person of their word he is a great father keeping his word.
The greatest feeling in the world I have the same feelings towards my dad he always comes through we are lucky. 
Only water? That is crazy lol
Did she confess?
Oh no. Well at least you know she is a terrible liar.
I think we all feel you on that one! 
There's still some time left to make the most of it_comma_ isn't there?
That is very sweet
I hope to have that one day
Sucks that no one told you!
It happens. I hope you're not too embarassed.
thats awesome .. how long has she been learning?
keep up the good work.
Yes that was an exciting moment for him and for the team as well!
I have a feeling that with Lebron on their team_comma_ they are going to do just that.
Oh wow_comma_ that is so scary! I would be worried for my family safety_comma_ maybe get a guard dog? My dog always alerts me to sounds.
Good idea_comma_ you can never be too safe when it comes to the safety of your family. I hope the police is watching your neighborhood more closely since the reports.
That's a good thing_comma_ right? So the families can get the help they need?
I can't begin to imagine how difficult it must be for the kids in that situation. It seems the school really has their back.
What game are you waiting for?
I used to love those games growing up so I can't judge you for it!
Hey it's ok. We all do stupid things when we are young. 
Give it time. I'm sure he will come around. 
That is so great I love dogs they are so sweet and your best friend for life.
They come with hard work have to walk and feed them but you will get back into your groove.
enjoy it while it lasts
oh sorry to hear that then 
OH no. Was it really late?
I watch too many murder shows to do that.
Oh_comma_ that's disappointing. What was wrong with it?
Ewwwwwww...the devil's topping. Did you send it back? 
That sounds horribly boring. You can always take this time to do some house work that you put off_comma_ so that it will be ready when your friends get back in town.
You're welcome. I'm sure you'll make it  they will be back soon. You could also always watch some Netflix.
What did you use the $5 for? Something good hopefully!
Sorry to hear that. You tried at least and your intentions were good.
You will have your day
I can understand that
Oh no! I've done that before.  Did you call them and ask for a grace period so you didn't build fines?  We all make mistakes like that so don't beat yourself up.
Those kinds of things are part of life and its better for our minds if we let them go and move on or see the humor in it.  I hope it didn't hurt your standing with the company.  You just reminded me to pay my internet bill! thanks!
Was it any good? Frozen foods can be weird.
That is so annoying. You're better off buying fresh on the day_comma_ even if it's inconvenient. 
Are you happy for them
Its natural so its okay
I hate storms.
I geet scared that we will lose power.
thats good.. seem like a good employee
there arent a lot of dedicated people like you. keep it up
If you need to take time off_comma_ then I'm sure your company will understand. 
What ever need you need to do. 
That's great. Summer classes can be tough. Because its summer
Well Im glad for him. He must be pretty determined.
Haha that's a smart strategy. What kind of things do you like to buy?
Oh I love seafood though. It's worth it I'd say lol.
What was the lie?
Were you cheating?
Why do you say that
Thats just being a good parent
Aw_comma_ that's so sweet of you. Doggos can be so rewarding. 
Is he an older dog or a puppy?
I don't doubt that you're feeling good about yourself! Are you getting the lump sum of monthly payments?
Hey_comma_ you can't complain about that! Who knows_comma_ you may end up using your skills to win the major jackpot.
thats good
good for you
Why?
How come no one would walk with you. I would be afraid too.
Are you able to afford one?
Good things come to those who wait_comma_ I know it's hard now because your friend got one but it'll work out for you
You should to them before you do that
Well maybe should be civil
Was the cake god? Sometimes you have to have your cake and eat it too haha. 
That sounds so yummy! See you much have needed those calories with skipping meals. Sounds like your a great baker as well.
Ugh. That's the worst. Have you called him/her? 
That's so frustrating. Ask for a break on the rent next month!
im sorry to hear that _comma_ whant happened ?
always believe in yourself_comma_ and dont let others opinions dictate your feelings 
Don't worry about it. Everybody messes up sometimes!
It just take a lot of practice_comma_ but you will get there!
what was it
oh thats sweet
That is great.  Congatulations!!!! Did you get a big raise_comma_ too?
It always feel good to get what you deserve!
Oh ok! Is that a bad thing or do you enjoy being single?
Oh yeah I know what you mean. Have you tried dating?
Yeah it was very different last time i tried! But I ended up meeting my partner through friends. You'll get there!
Why is that
I do too_comma_ its okay
sorry to hear that.. what happened
hopefully she didnt suffer.
I hate that for you
I can understand tat
Oh wow_comma_ any special reason for him doing that?
How sweet of him.
That's always so fun to see everything that's gone on in your life.  Do you have a favorite moment that was captured in a picture?
They grow up so fast!  How many kids do you have?
Sounds like you are so blessed though!  I know you must miss them while they're away.  You have been a priceless influence on them.  They will always love you!
That's too bad. You're not quitting are you?
They will get over it
That's a pretty wild story. Why do you think the aliens chose you in particular?
Well be sure to lock your doors and windows before bed tonight_comma_ hopefully that will keep them out.
Oh wow_comma_ that's a pretty scary movie.  I'd want company while watching it too.
I get what you mean.  Some films just aren't for some people.  It takes some courage to watch.
Good luck.  But besides it being scary it's a good film in general.  Hope you two can enjoy it.
oh thats really nice _comma_ my friend in new york also has to do a test soon to get a promotion_comma_ i hope u get it - u can do it !!!
promotions are always good more money _comma_and a better life i believe in you !!!
I think that you are absolutely right!  Thanksgiving is the best!  I love the food_comma_ and family.  Are your family coming to you_comma_ or are you going to the?
Is the brother from Germany coming home?
That sucks_comma_ Did you reschedule?
I hate when that happens. Especially when the same people do it over and over.
Why would she do that
That is sad
It wasn't Dave Ramsey was it?
Ha I took a shot in the dark. I have heard him recommended a lot for people who want to learn how to pay down debt and save money.
Have you found it?
It very well could have been. I'm sorry_comma_ that sucks.
That is terrible. 
I don't know. They should be locked up though. Hurting a person is next.
Oh_comma_ that is nerve-racking.You have to be on-guard. Did they behave themselves? 
Ugh. I don't understand that either. And they make everyone so anxious just be existing. 
That would be great wouldn't it? They have it made!
Yeah but you also wouldn't live as long either. 
I know that feeling.  I have a husband and a boyfriend living here and it still feels empty.
Maybe maybe LOL.. I have four dogs.. argh!
It's nice to have generous friends.  Did you have something good?
Ohhh_comma_ delicious. 
Its nice to have a reliable person like that
I am sure he will do a good job
oh cool_comma_ what was it about?
Wow that's nice_comma_ how old is she?
Did they have a good reason?
Well maybe you can reschedule and do something even more fun
I am sorry_comma_ how important were they
I am sorry_comma_ that sounds stressful
It's always nice to visit with friends you haven't seen in a while.
I'm happy to hear you enjoyed yourself!
More money is always nice
That sounds awesome
Did you have fun? 
It's always nice when an event lives up to the hype. Was it at a bar or a house or where?
That's great. I wish my daughter was determined like that.
In the classes that she likes. It is pretty frustrating for me
I hear 35 is the new 25!
I hope they don't either! Sounds like the perfect birthday celebration.
There are some apps that allow a friend to follow your progress as you home. Will that make you feel safer?
Ducks are scary_comma_ but they are more scared of you than you are of them. 
Whats it about?
oooh all that physics makes my head spin
Oh love! I can only imagine the feelings you must be experiencing. Do you have a good support system in place?
I'm so glad you have people to lean on -- though obviously_comma_ your experience is *yours* and no one can know exactly how you're feeling. Are you familiar with Kris Carr_comma_ with your interest in a plant-based approach to diet?
She's very inspiring -- you'll love her! Sending you ALL the best in healing vibes_comma_ love_comma_ and light!
Oh well_comma_ there is always next time
Just try and keep in touch when you can
I'm really glad to hear that! What kind of job is it_comma_ if you don't mind me asking?
Oh_comma_ that sounds pretty cool. I kind of had my eye on a career like that when I was in school_comma_ but ultimately didn't go that route. What will you be doing specifically?
I bet that was disgusting! I would bring a noseplug from now on.
I love hiking_comma_ I can't imagine happening upon something so gross. Would probably ruin my hike as well!
That's really sweet of you. I hope your cat is doing better!
Well I'm sure with you taking care of him_comma_ he'll be fine!
That does sound fun though
I hope you have fun
That's what pictures are for. Are you guys ever going to live together?
We that's good. The photos will keep you close
The snails? Yikes. Well_comma_ I've always thought it probably gets a worse rap than it actually should_comma_ and probably doesn't taste that bad. Half of why I think it's probably gross is simply because they made it seem gross in old cartoons. So_comma_ how did it taste?
Yeah_comma_ that's true! Especially since you were on a cruise_comma_ it sounds like it's all a part of the experience. At least you can say you didn't chicken out. I'm glad you decided to go that way_comma_ because now you have a special memory tied to that vacation;
Oh man_comma_ I feel for you.  Kids grow up so fast.  Do you feel prepared for it?
I hear you.  I have a 8 year old daughter and it feels like she was born yesterday.  
That sucks? Did you see anything?
I can imagine. I had a car stolen once while I was at work. Broke my heart
I've never seen it. Why do you like it?
What is it about?
That's great_comma_ so you enjoy looking after them?
Yeah I can understand that! Well at least they have each other_comma_ and hopefully they will grow more social together
That happens sometimes. Sometimes life just gets in the way. Heck_comma_ sometimes you just decide you can't physically do a night out_comma_ and that's okay_comma_ too. I'm sure they'd understand no matter what. Maybe you can make it up to them somehow.
Maybe take a few days to think it over_comma_ and then when the weekend comes_comma_ think of a way to surprise them in order to make it up to them. Or if nothing else_comma_ just be as honest as possible and not try to cover anything up when you need to bail on them. They'll appreciate that the most.
I am sorry_comma_ I guess some friends just argue like that
I am sure you guys will make up
I love visiting breweries! What's your favorite kind of beer?
Not my favorite but I had a really good one the other day with some kind of fruit in it_comma_ I could have downed a gallon of the stuff.
Ohhh gotta hate that friend!   What do you drive?
I drive a gianormous conversion van
In what ways do you mean?
Wow they were over $2 when I was 18!
Wow_comma_ congratulations to him! He must have been studying very hard for his exams.
I'm sure he has a bright future ahead! Tell him to keep up the good work.
oh_comma_ dear. That sounds lonely. How are you holding up?
I can imagine. But you'll make new connections there_comma_ I'm sure.
I know how you feel.  I moved about 3 hours away from my hometown for school and stayed for 3 years and hated it.  I moved back to my hometown and am so happy now.  I'm sorry you're having a tough time.  Have you gotten out and tried to meet people?
I would go with your gut.  Sometimes things don't work out_comma_ but you might just need more time to meet people and might want to hang in there.  I hope you meet a best friend soon!
That is a great friend! I'm happy you were able to see your family.
She sounds like one of a king! Not many people are that generous.
Wow that's really frustrating. 
Oh yuck! That is so gross!
I do_comma_ too.  We just need to take better care of the resources we have and plant more trees.  Do you do anything "green".
If we could just get more people on board to do that we would be on the right track.
I am glad that he did. It is always good to stay hopeful.
That's great. Health scares are very real and scary.
I LOVED Disneyland growing up! Did you go often? How old were you and what was your favorite ride?
Ha! I hear you on that. I also loved the Matterhorn! And the Haunted House. We used to spend summers in Tucson with my grandparents_comma_ and they would drive us to Disneyland every year ;-)
That's awesome! What a nice surprise. And congratulations on graduating. That's a big accomplishment. What did you graduate in? 
Oh_comma_ very cool. I thought about majoring in English_comma_ too_comma_ but decided to go a different route. I hope your new degree helps you land the job you want! You're now in the exciting unknown part of your life.
Just try and teach them to be more careful with them
I am sure it will get beter
That's so nice of him to do. No one wants to help anyone out these days but I'm glad for you.
There's always Uber!
I am so sorry to hear that! Cancer is such a horrible disease.
I've actually lost two family members last year_comma_ so I can relate. It's something that will stick with you until the day you die.
That's unfortunate. Does she know that it happened?
I am sorry to hear that. Maybe next time you can just ask her.
Best of luck to you. The tension and nerves must be killing you!
It's a tough market out there_comma_ but I have faith that you get what you desire!
I am sorry you have that. It must be rough
I can only imagine
Wow_comma_ congratulations on getting a new job!  I think butterflies are good to have to make us do our best and it shows your job is important to you and you want to do a good job.  What do you do?
That sounds fun. Have you done something like it before or is the whole kind of job new to you?  Good luck and I know you'll do great!  Act confident even if you don't feel like it. Sometimes that can help.
Ah_comma_ that's rough. That was a very bold move on your part. But sometimes fortune favors the bold_comma_ as they say. I think you'll be happy later on not having to wonder "what if." Still though_comma_ she could have maybe been more discrete about things.
Ah_comma_ I see. Well_comma_ it's a good thing you were rejected thing_comma_ maybe. At least now you know what kind of a bullet you dodged. Plus_comma_ this is just another step in your overall confidence and character building. The next time you ask someone else out_comma_ it will be easier.
That is very nice of him.
Yes_comma_ a very cool thing.
Sometimes that can be a good thing? It's not always so bad!
Maybe next weekend will be better for you!
I hate when those come around
I am sure it will soon
you should not feel bad _comma_we all need alone time
honesty is great and all _comma_ but sometimes you need some time to yourself_comma_ i feel you on that tho
Oh wow_comma_ that's great! Only bad thing is he will be very busy with two jobs.
That's great to hear!
There is nothing wrong with that at all. I've done it a few times before. Nobody in the theater knows or cares that you're there alone.
If you always wait for somebody to come with you_comma_ you may miss out on a movie that you want to see as well. So there's that.
where are you going
oh thats cool
I'm glad to hear something positive happened to you. Were you able to do something fun or productive with the time off? And what was the occasion?
Ah_comma_ pretty cool. It's nice that you decided to have family time instead of just alone time. I bet they were excited_comma_ too. Hopefully work rewards you more often like that.
I would love to do that as well
I would love to go to hawaii
That's great! It's hard to do that sometimes_comma_ especially on the weekends!
I'm proud of you for sticking to it!
Oh yeah? What kind of animal do you think it was?
Maybe it was an armadillo. I get them in my yard sometimes.
Oh no_comma_ what did they say to convince you?
Maybe I'm too gullible as well because that would convince me!
That is a relief. Did any coworker friends get laid off?
I've been there. It's so sad_comma_ but it will get better. 
Maybe you can change that jealous energy into positive energy! Do some research into fitness and start a new journey.
One tip I tell people is that they don't need to change WHAT they eat_comma_ only how much. Calorie intake is the important factor_comma_ not what type of calories.
Holy cow_comma_ that's terrible. I really feel for you. My dad had that happen to him and his dog when he was young_comma_ and he's told me about it as a warning to make sure I'm safe with ours. I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I hope you get through the grieving process okay.
I would definitely take as long as you need_comma_ so you don't put unhealthy pressure or expectation on the animal to live up to a memory it can't live up to. But if you feel comfortable with the idea_comma_ then I would consider it when the time is right. You'll know when that is.
That's great_comma_ what did he give you?
Do you know why he gave it to you?
Oh no! That's not good at all. It's hard to diagnose things sometimes
Well I'm glad he got some antibiotics for it. I hope that helped enough!
Oh now that's exciting! I moved two years ago and it was a very weird process. I was happy to have a new home but anxious at the same time.
Well that's great. I'm happy to hear you guys are getting out of a bad home.
Oh_comma_ I totally understand.  It's frustrating when you feel like you're putting in the same effort (or more!) and it works better for other people.  
Well_comma_ it's good that at least you're making progress!  It would be crazy frustrating if you weren't.  Congrats on your hard work paying off. 
Ah yes_comma_ does it bring back good memories? Nostalgia is a powerful thing.
I'm so glad that you had the chance to make those memories with your cousins!
That sure is embarrassing_comma_ did he get talked to about his behavior? 
I agree_comma_ at that age kids should definitely know better and think before doing something. Unbelievable. 
You should be proud. These are the moments you are never going to want to forget.
Yeah_comma_ but don't worry. More memories are yet to come!
Your youthful vigor? You think you're too old now? You're only too old if you allow yourself to be. My girlfriend's 90-year-old grandfather was a full-of-life WWII vet who lit up the room when he came in. Of course_comma_ you're not as physically active_comma_ but you have to learn to utilize your life in different ways.
Well_comma_ maybe it's an opportunity for introspection. For you to take time out of your day to think about what you need and want_comma_ and what are the best ways to achieve that. Maybe you need a better diet_comma_ or sleep schedule_comma_ or meditation_comma_ or an exercise routine. Sometimes you have to spend energy to feel energized. It's a slow process in the beginning_comma_ but it can be life-changing.
Any plans for Friday?
That's awesome! I bet these next few days will fly by
I bet you were! What kind of laptop was it? 
My husband also has a Lenovo. He really likes it!
Wowza! That's impressive. I wonder how long until he's called up.
You will be able to say you saw him before he was famous! 
I'm really sorry to hear that... That's the worst scenario too_comma_ because you're parked and probably not even there_comma_ so you were completely powerless in the situation_comma_ and then you come back to your car to just have this bomb dropped on you. Maybe there's something that can be worked out_comma_ since you just purchased it.
There has to be something. It can't just be this weird vulnerable loophole. I really hope so_comma_ for your case_comma_ because that's just unfair. I'm sure your work will understand_comma_ but it's still a crummy situation that is probably affecting all areas of your life. Transportation gets taken for granted. Hope things get better soon.
I'm so glad you got to visit with them!  I know how you feel to be far from family and home alone.  Take heart that you are loved by your family and friends even when they aren't around.
I can see why its even harder on you when they leave.  That's wonderful that they are such a part of your life.  Take care and get out with friends soon to brighten your spirits!
That's quite scary!  Are you able to see who it is?
You might want to call 911 if they continue banging on the door.  Better safe than sorry!
Wow_comma_ how long has he been juggling for?
I wonder how people figure that thing out about themselves? Very cool_comma_ though.
Sometimes you just have to concede defeat. I admire your resigned attitude.
Then it was your lucky day. I usually follow someone like that and they will end up getting pulled over before me.
Oh_comma_ no.  I think I see where this is headed.  
LOL.  Do you really think so?  That has happened to me before.  Sometimes_comma_ it's just too hard to pass up.  Thank you for sharing.  
Congratulations on making a plan and sticking with it. What kind of diet are you doing?
You can do anything (realistically) as long as you stay consistent and take it one day at a time!
did it bite you!
oh thats cool then
That would really anger me as well.  What did you do?  Did you find the person who did it?
Yeah_comma_ it blows my mind that people think they can damage other peoples belonging and just go about their day.  
I'm happy for you! Everyone deserves to be excited about life.
Thank you very much. Much success to you!
Your family was being polite. If I did that my family would order a pizza_comma_ hah.
It's all good. Maybe you should try something simple like Hamburger Helper. Can't really  mess that up.
I didn't even know they were making another_comma_ I loved the first!
That is friggin' awesome! I sure hope they can keep up the quality in the upcoming movies.
Congratulation.
You had a good idea. Each of us need to find the correct way to lose weight.
Wow_comma_ good luck.  I hope it all goes well. It sounds like you're confident that it will. Have you done one before?
I know you're do great then!  Hope it brings you a lot of success!
Really?  That is awesome.  I used to watch reruns of that show all the time.
I will have to try to watch it.  Sounds like a good time
Those poor dogs! I hate puppy mills so much and unfortunately I live in an area where they are very common.
There are laws here but they find ways around them. People are cruel and only care about money.
Oooh I don't like owls... they creep me out
was it big
did you get to keep them?
thats awesome
That is awesome_comma_ did you ask your boss for one or was it unexpected? 
That must mean you're a hard worker. You should keep at it then!
I hate that. That's one of my biggest pet peeves. That's such an awkward situation_comma_ because you don't want to come off as high maintenance and ask them to stop_comma_ but it'd be so easy for them to have better manners_comma_ too. I wish I had better advice. Maybe go to HR?
Yeah_comma_ absolutely. That's what I meant earlier_comma_ too_comma_ about being high maintenance. I don't know_comma_ maybe earbuds? But I'm sure you've tried that. Who knows how they would respond if you asked them personally_comma_ and if they actually did improve_comma_ they'd probably just forget and revert back in a few days anyway.
Wow!  That is impressive!  You must be really prod of yourself!
Haha!  That's funny!  I work out to drink and eat bad food as well!  Awesome achievement with your running!  Keep at it!
Hey_comma_ honest mistake. Obviously you didn't come up with some dumb lie and make it seem like they made the mistake and not you. You owned up to it. I'm sure they appreciate that more than you would figure.
I'm glad! It's the honest truth. Everyone screws up. And I bet it will motivate you to never make that mistake again_comma_ too. So in the end_comma_ they have someone who's sharper about things. Good to hear it worked out in your favor.
yes dude the world is a trip_comma_ i made many friends over the years online and when i bump into them i make sure i go up to them and chit chat and shake hands_comma_ you never know when someone will pass away _comma_ 
i have in real life friends _comma_ and a regular job _comma_ but because of back problems and sciatica ive made many friends online i consider to be like brothers social media has let me make relationships while in bed lol
That's so unfair. I would complain very loudly if that happened to me!
I feel your pain. Life is really unfair sometimes.
Stranger things is one of my favorite shows!  It stinks that the next season has been pushed to next summer though.
I feel ya.  The kids will be all grown up by then!
That is awesome!  He is such an amazing athlete!  Any team that has him is lucky!
I guarantee they will!  That's raw talent right there!
wow .. so am i .. i could not imagine doing that. its great that you are going to do it though
i wish you good luck.. 
Oh_comma_ my dad use to play with those all the time when we were young and he'd let us touch them!
I never did want to hold it_comma_ but I was curious enough to touch it! They're actually kind of cute.
Oh no! I hate when that happens... hopefully your computers holds on a little longer for it to go back down
Well good luck! I know how frustrating that can be
Wow_comma_ why are they still shooting off fireworks? Don't they know it's a one day holiday?
I agree. It must be hard to get any sleep. I feel bad for any animals in the area too!
yea i hear that... it was much better back then
that i think you are right
That is impressive. He must have been prepared well for the switch.
Good for him. It takes me forever to find a job.
Wow_comma_ how exciting! Boy or girl? 
Yeah I'm sure! Is this your first? 
Well congratulations! :D
wow that's such an awesome surprise!
that's a great husband and best friend
Where were you at? Why couldn't you go home? Sounds frustrating.
Oh that is frustrating. I bet you were very annoyed.
oh wow.. first time going to france?
thats awesome .. i wish i could go there.. 
That sounds lonely. Maybe you should try to hang out with some of your classmates?
I hear you. At least it is only for a month. Maybe you can make some weekend trips to do fun things.
That's hilarious!  Did you try to play it off like you meant to do that?
Well_comma_ at least you were honest about it.  I bet you will never put your shirt on inside out again!  So_comma_ consider it a lesson learned!
It is always good to take the time to reflect on happy memories.  I do that from time to time myself
I am glad you were able to look back fondly and remember that good times.
Oh_comma_ man!  That is a nightmare!  Was your boss upset with you?
Yeah_comma_ it happens to the best of us.  You just have to try and forget about it and move forward.
That is great! Do you have any fun plans?
Oh wow! That will be really fun!
whats wrong with your cat
im sorry to hear that.. she will be in peace soon enough.
That would make me mad. Did you know who did it?
That's too bad. Maybe they could check security cameras for you.
time to look for one that deserves you
i hope you find happiness .. doesnt look like its gonna be with him.. goodluck though!
I'm so sorry to hear that. What happened?
I would be heart-broken as well. You know you can always talk to me if you need to
Oh no_comma_ why are all the pets dying. It is so sad when that happens.
I bet you will miss your feline friend. Hopefully they are in a better place now.
I would have done the same! I don't like snakes
I found a garden snake in my yard the other day and despite it being little it still creeped me out
That was very nice. Why couldn't you have a baby shower?
Yes_comma_ that is nice. A baby shower_comma_ just without the people. Still great!
Oh no! Inquiring minds want to know... is there plans for a second date?
Well_comma_ you don't want to date someone who doesn't like coffee anyway. :)
That's great! How does that make you feel?
You should go out and meet friends! Go out and do hobbies that you like. I bet you'll meet some new friends. Are you in a big city?
Who let him out? Did he run away?
Oh that is so sad. I hope you find him!
Oh_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that. Sometimes when you "give up"_comma_ someone good comes along
Maybe you can get a pet to distract you. It could even help socialize like if you get a dog and go to a dog park
That is awesome. Your kiddo will be talking your ear off in no time.
Yeah I know how it is. My kids drive me nuts now. They are 8 and 9.
Man_comma_ that sucks. Are you going to go back and return it or did you eat it already?
I say in that case don't worry about it. Mistakes happen.
That should have been scary?
Nice. How did you find the city?
It mean that you are smart.
You never know.
That's great! I know that is an amazing feeling to have.
That's wonderful. A car is one of the most useful purchases one can make I think.
Ouch_comma_ I bet that must have hurt!
That could be some trauma there... but I am sure you will get back into the swing of things (no pun intended).
That is unfortunate. Did they reschedule the picnic?
I'm glad you feel better knowing that it will happen next week.
That's awesome! How did it go?
That is so cool. I'm glad you found your soulmate!
How did you find that out? Ultrasound or intuition?
Ah I have two girls too and remember the same old wive's tale haha. Good luck on that boy!
Pretty names. Mine are Kaitlyn and Alyssa.
Thats awesome! I hope the visit goes well :)
Oh wow so the pressure is on to make a good impression haha
That's great! Good luck! That attitude says a lot.
That's a recipe for success. I think you'll crush it.
Wow that's a bold move. How is he getting along with that?
That's great! I think as long as he is happy_comma_ he's doing whatever is right for him.
That's great. I'm a native spaker_comma_ but from what I understand English is very hard to actually learn
They absolutely do. Kids are like sponged. It's been said that it's much easier for kids to learn multiple languages than adults
what kind of exam is it _comma_ and you sound confident you got this 
That is awesome to hear _comma_ preparation will help you knock this out like a champ
That's awesome! You must have felt so proud of your achievements.
That's good. I was never very good at math in school.
Were you doing it in a public place? Weed can do that to someone.
You may want to smoke less next time. Do it in moderation.
That's too bad.  Have you given serious thought to trying to lose weight?
Hmmm.   I encourage you to keep trying.   Even if you don't ge tto your dieal weight_comma_ just getting halfway would show trememndous progress.
That is so romantic. I also try to surprise my girlfriend occasionally with some little gifts
Such things even though may seem little have much positive impact on couple's relationship
Wow good for him. Now he can drive you around.
He is moving forward pretty fast. But that means you can ride with him that much sooner.
Wow im sorry to hear that. It sucks when something goes wrong at a job you've been there long
I'm glad you found a job quick! That must have felt a little good to tell them at least
Don't you hate how "customer service" has no service anymore?  Did you get the refund at least?
I'm sorry that you had to experience that.  It's totally unfair!
What makes life so hard right now?
Very true. What would you want to do in the 60's?
Why you don't want to join the comic book club?
I understand. You could find a book club outside school.
Oh_comma_ that's wonderful!  Tell them congratulations for me! You must be bursting with pride!  
Do they have any aspirations yet or are they just figuring out life?
Congrats! Time really does fly by_comma_ doesn't it? What was your favorite moment from it all/
Aww_comma_ that does sound quite lovely. Before you know it it'll be 20 years! Any special plans then?
Well studying is a good place to start. Do you feel confident about how well you will do?
That's a good attitude to have. Good luck_comma_ I'm sure you'll do great (assuming you keep the procrastination in check)!
Hi
What did you do to protect yourself?
That's awesome! I've never been to Colorado but I hear great things! haha
11 years is a long time_comma_ I hope you have a great time!
oh that sucks_comma_ were you able to get anything
wow that's great!
I'm glad he was able to help.  Was the battery dead?
Yes_comma_ because a dead battery is much easier to fix than a busted starter or ignition switch.  :D  
Wow that is awesome! Congratulations. I am already 31 
How many people are invited? and where is it gonna be?
wow! That sounds wonderful_comma_ I wish I were there too.  Are u wishing a special gift? 
Oh man_comma_ long distance is hard.
Have you met in person?
So sorry to hear that. What happened? Is it something serious?
I hope the surgery went successfully and with no hassle. I had a friend who went through the same thing. Wish you all the best
Hey bro. or sis......you are talking to me now.....hope it helps some.
Just concentrate on the here and now......Your partner will be back soon.
Did he get mad at you?
Buy him something sweet_comma_ like a chocolate cake_comma_ it usually helps.
It's always good to go to places that make you feel younger again_comma_ it brings back good memories.
Thats great_comma_ never lose touch with your childhood.
That sounds fun! What system do you play it on? I haven't played Mario Kart since the Wii.
I definitely have a Switch on my Christmas list! Maybe I will get myself one for my birthday.
That's wonderful! I love those 'surprise visit' occassions. Sadly my parents would need to fly across the country to do that and it's just not feasible given my work schedule
Oh_comma_ your situation knocks mine out for sure. That's great that they did that. Traveling is unfortunatly_comma_ very expensive 
Eeeek! I can't watch those anymore like I used to when I was a teenager. I bet you got scared!  Those replay in my mind over and over.
Once_comma_ I was watching a horror movie a loooong time ago and the phone was ringing in the movie and then didn't work all of a sudden and then it happened to me and my friend in real life right at the same time! It was crazy but it was just a storm outside. ha ha.
What did you do?
Same thing I guess_comma_ it's hard to imagine such situations.
I'm sorry. Do you enjoy having the apartment to yourself?
That's true. I hope you find someone new to share it with.
Wow! I'm actually really jealous. How did that make you feel?
What all did you buy?
Would you like to buy me something? I'm just kidding. That's great; you deserve it. 
What even made you think about that?
Think of positive thinks instead_comma_ you have control over that.
Dang_comma_ don't you hate when that happens. What did he promise you this time?
Well make sure it is going straight to you. No drinks or smokes unless you say so.
Would you believe I have never seen a Star Wars movie? Don't hate me lol
I am a fan of GAme of Thrones though.
Right!? One of the best shows of all time in my opinion_comma_ what are we suppose to do with our time?
Good choice_comma_ I forgot what outside is
That's nice. I bet he appreciated it.
You're a good person. Everyone isnt so lucky.
Are you enrolling into army?
Well good luck_comma_ its a tough life.
That's a big time in someone's life.  Do you feel ready for this new phase?
How far away will you be?
Oh man_comma_ that is a long way.  Do you have family visits planned so you have something to look forward to and help you get through?
You might fall in love with it and end up sticking it out.  You never know_comma_ but leaving family is hard.
Oh wow! What an accomplishment!
What kind of doctor will she be?
Oh. I don't know how medical school works. I am studying srt history.
That is awesome_comma_ what kind of cat was it?
That is great_comma_ make sure you pass it on to your kids as well!
im so excited for you_comma_ my friend has gone twice he said a lot of people are passed out drunk on the street _comma_ and even taco bell sells alcohol very weird place
i would love going one day as well _comma_ just ignore the drunk people i bet your gonna have a blast
I just almost threw up a bit when you described it to me.  So I understand
I cannot imagine anyone wanting to drink that without losing a bet
Ugh I hate crap like that.  Why can't credit be shared?  Does it always have to be so cutthroat?
Well All's well that ends well.  I'm sure glad they were able to see through such a cheap ploy.
Hey people get what the deserve in this world sometimes.  Just be glad justice is served.
Holidays are a great time for family. I love that too.
Do you get to gether for all holidays?
What did they do this time? Kids are always getting into stuff.
Those bums. Maybe then need to be reminded who is the boss.
That's awesome! It really pays not to burn bridges_comma_ you never know when someone from your past can help you out like that.
I'm happy for you. If only more bosses were like that_comma_ the workforce would be a lot happier and productive I think.
Oh no_comma_ I can imagine how you must have felt when you realized.  Did you get sick?
I can understand that too....  Did you double check the bread before the next sandwich?
That is not cool. I sure hope they fix their mess up quick!
I would definitely give them a bad review and try to speak to someone higher up.
That's terrible. Was anyone hurt?
You're lucky. That could have been really bad. Did he stop?
He shouldn't have a license.
That's a very stressful time in a person's life_comma_ but I'm sure she'll adapt!
Does she have a good group of close friends? Maybe she's confident because of that.
Growing up is hard at every stage in a person's life
I'm glad you have a good plan for success this semester.  Did you pass last semester?
That is really good.  I've found that a good schedule is the backbone of a good year.  It sounds like you've got it figured out.
That's awesome.
Is the place nice? Have you seen it yet?
Well that's good. You guys will enjoy each other.
Oh no! How did you and your family do? Was the house damaged?
Hopefully that never will happen to you again_comma_ that is terrible.
I can imagine you are nervous.  What will you do?
Well_comma_ I wish you the best of luck.  I understand that is a stressful situation
I have never heard of silverfish_comma_ but if you have to hire an exterminator that sounds serious. I hope you are ok!
That is really annoying to hear. I would be so furious if I was in your position.
Wow that is a long time. Why is it taking so long?
That is pretty annoying for sure. I hope they get moved in so they stop bothering you.
Golf? I could never get into it.
Do you play too?
That's no good.  What did he do?
That is so annoying.  Have you reported him_comma_ or asked him to be sure to close the mailbox?
That's great. I can't wait to retire and travel
Are you goig to travel?
It's always good to start them young! Hopefully they love it and stick to it.
I agree. Kids can get a lot more out of sticking to those types of sports other than just physical exercise. It teaches them great personality traits like dedication and hard work.
omg that is so scary _comma_ especially if you took all your little ones with you that day
refund and tickets wont do anything _comma_ someone messed up big and they need to be fired 
It happens. Maybe you should hide one somewhere in case you get locked out again.
Well I had to call my landlord once to get back in my place. I know how it feels.
That is awesome for your kid! Now she knows hard work pays off.
It is always a great feeling when you see your kids succeed. 
Wow_comma_ that sounds pretty special. Are you his only child?
Uh oh_comma_ well only have kids if you really want them. 
Wow! He houldl do competitions. I have only seen that on TV
Must have been pretty cool to watch. How much do you bench press?
I love cereal too. What type do your kids enjoy?
Oh wow_comma_ how is it expiring already?
I agree_comma_ they should check their dates more closely!
Always gamble in moderation_comma_ how much did you lose? Enough to get the hubby mad? 
If you ever need help with a gambling problem talk to someone_comma_ never keep it bottled up.
How did it feel?
You need to get into more relationships_comma_ then you'll enjoy it more.
That's kind of rude for them not to invite you. You should tell them you were hurt.
You are right. Now you know who your real friends are.
True. i think the store should introduce some policies for punishing such individuals with fines
Excellent. When i was visiting Turkey_comma_ they had the same thing for carts used to carry your luggage
He sucks
Forget him. There are soo many girls out there.
Why? Is there something wrong with the daycare?
I'm sorry_comma_ I think you are making the right choice.
There's nothing wrong with that. Unless you're mean
Maybe you shoud pretend you are still at work until you get the hang of it.
Wow_comma_ and you just walked out the store with them?
Oh_comma_ I thought you stole them_comma_ but I've done that before too. Not to that extent though.
Thats sad to hear. Do you have any old pictures of it that you could look at?
Maybe you could go visit it sometime if you have the opportunity. That would be a great vacation idea.
Sorry to hear that.Are you still locked out?
Well_comma_ you just have to be patient.
Why? I will be your friend if you need friends.
Take a chance and go to a coffee shop or bar.
Really?? Are you over-protective of your kids?
How many kids are you talking about?
Don't worry. Ask some help from your friends and family.
Happy to hear! have a happy home!
I'm ready to meet my interviewer tomorrow.
How did it go? Was it his first sleep over?
That's impressive for a 3 year old!  I didn't have my first sleepover til I was 6.
I have never had that. We don't have them here. Good thing though lol
I would have done the same.
Did you tell him anything?
Well it's his driveway I guess.
Why was it sad?
My condolences_comma_ I hope you are doing alright now.
Oh no! Why was it so bad?
That bad huh? Well_comma_ I'm sorry you did not enjoy it
woohooo i bet you are super excited
he should not waste this away
Oh no! Can you find a different_comma_ less expensive dress? Or borrow one from a friend?
Ah_comma_ well I'm sorry it didn't work out. But_comma_ at least you have other options!
Friends sometimes have a sixth sense for that sort of thing_comma_ don't they?
It's a great feeling to have so many people who care about you_comma_ I'm sure!
Congrats. Enjoy it and keep yourself grateful. It's easy to take things for granted sometimes.
The bad times sometimes make us appreciate the good times even more
that's great! Sometimes it's kind of hard to save up money but it's good to have something saved up when things get bad
you should be proud of yourself! good job!
Awesome! I wish I was more productive sometimes. It would really make my life easier
Absolutely. If only if only lol. Maybe I should get a better alarm too so I get up earlier
Oh_comma_ I've been there! I looked like a person who cut when I used to give a lot of cat baths! Did you clean it right away? (cat scratch fever)
It isn't too bad_comma_ mild cold symptoms usually for a few days_comma_ I hope its ok! Do you cut his nails or put nail caps on? Good for bath time.
No I have not? I think it might be fun though. Have you?
What kind of robot is it? What does it do?
Is it a really good job?
Maybe you should tell him that?
What do you mean by that?
Those people need to find something better to do with their time! Get a hobby_comma_ people!
Oh man! I've been there. That is hard. I hope it wasn't too long!
Don't you hate that when people don't tell you? Well now you know your co-workers can't be trusted! But maybe they were busy and just didn't notice- which is goo!
Aw so sweet! Your very welcome. We've all been there! I completely understand. I don't think anyone saw :)
did they steal anything
sorry you have to live in a not so desirable neighborhood
I have been there! Isn't it nice to feel secure even if for a little bit?
Stocking up is always good. And getting a side business in case
I bet you were really excited.
Yeah_comma_ found money is always the best money.
pretty annoying jeez
if you were on the other end you wouldn
Good work. You must be feeling so healthy and fresh.
Yes_comma_ you will even begin to look years younger as well!
That's hard. Was it a bad breakup?
Well_comma_ sometimes we lose things if we don't take care of them or just sometimes partners don't appreciate us either.
Oh my_comma_ was the surgery successful?
I agree_comma_ but always stay positive and hope for the best.
That's sucks_comma_ you should quit if they don't appreciate you.
I know_comma_ finding a new job can be a daunting task_comma_ but you should at least keep your options open.
You have a pet duck? That's nuts!
What sort of things do you feed him?
It is hard! Maybe they aren't right then. So many people are just not trustworthy. What have you tried?
Maybe it's time to move? Try church?
Which one?  Was it good?  I've read a decent amount of those_comma_ but I'm always looking for more.
I've never heard of it.  What's it about?
What size pizza was it? If it was a large_comma_ I am not sure how you didn't get sick.
What kind of pizza was it?
Oh_comma_ that's fun to hear. What kind of class is it? Are you teaching_comma_ or a student_comma_ or what?
Oh_comma_ very cool. High school? College? I loved certain history classes. Some were hit or miss. And I was never the best at remembering dates. It always depended on how interesting the topic was.
That is a whole lot of nutrition!
Yea_comma_ that sounds good. You should buy some more!
Oh no_comma_ I take it that you aren't happy about it?
Sometimes you have to let people make mistakes to really learn from them.
Cool. Everyonr needs a vacation. Where are you going?
The beach is a great place to relax as long as the weather is nice.
Well enjoy yourself!
I bet you are excited
I hope you have fun
That is always nice when your hard work finally pays off.
Now you should go and celebrate.
 HOW SWEET.. HAVE A GREAT TRIP 
I KNOW .. IT WOULD BE IN TRIGUING .. BY THE WAY _comma_ IS IT YOUR FIRST EVER TIRP 
Hunting_comma_ fishing and computers.
I do read occasionally_comma_ do you?
That sounds really fun. Are you going to go?
Have fun!
Oh? That's pretty interesting! How did it go?
I wish you the best of luck! I bet you did fine
I know the feeling.
Well they are the one that has to deal with the consequences... mostly i guess.
Oh no! Well they have a lot of great deals online right now.
Yes you should be fine. You can get two day shipping and get lots of cool stuff.
That's true! Maybe check clearances to stock up for next year soon :)
Thats a sad thing to hear
Thats good of you
I am glad! Tell me about it?
Oh is it a country property?
How come? Is something wrong?
Oh I see_comma_ do people bug you for money often?
I would love that! Give me that feeling :)
No not really. I don't have to rush but I don't wake up too happy usually. I am glad you are having a restful time. Cherish it
I have had to do this too with my best friends (My beloved dogs). It is hard. I know how you feel because I have been there more times then I want to remember. 
Minute by minute and I remind myself that my best friend is no longer in pain.
Well_comma_ it is almost the fact of life that irresponsible people will not last much and regret will be only consequence for them
I think over time_comma_ they will realize how wasteful and meaningless their behavior is and would start to change for better
I feel the same way! Prices have already risen on a lot including for people selling things in certain states.
I hope they do. I don't know how he hasn't been impeached yet.
Oh yeah? It's always a bit suspicious when someone just changes their attitude like that.
They didn't even apologize? Wow_comma_ that's rude. Well_comma_ hopefully their friendlier mood will last a while.
Oh no_comma_ Did you end up lading safley.
That's good to hear!
Did the snake try to strike at you?
I'm glad you didn't get bit!
Wow. What kind was it?
Are there a lot of snakes where you live?
My first time was scary too!
Was it a long flight?
I bet! My sister is happy about that too_comma_ she has 4 daughters.
That sounds hectic! 
That sounds really interesting! How do you like it so far?
That would be hard! Do you now Spanish well?
The other day someone flipped out on me all of a sudden.
Nothing good. I am not talking to them again. Maybe ever. Too much of it. It's not really any fun to deal with someone who has so much baggage and childhood issues.
Did you get a good look at the guy?
that sucks.  Did they place you were at have cameras?
I'm sorry_comma_ I'm sure you find one soon.
Just stay persistent and it will happen.
She's lucky to have such a great kid.
Exactly_comma_ we have to return the favor since they put up with us when we were little.
Oh my goodness_comma_ me either!
Are you going to a Univeristy?
What are you studying to be?
That's interesting. A lot of cool things to learn for sure.
I bet it did!
That is understandable. I have to catch myself sometimes when my kids are in the car.
If people were just more considerate of the other people around them...
That is so true.
Congrats! How is it going?
That seems very trivial but do you mean that he still doesn't seem to know you?
Have you tried counseling_comma_ reading going through a program? Are there good things? I know it is hard when a partner doesn't work on a relationship and keep it good
For sure but no relationship is perfect and everything takes work
Cool. Are you saving for something specific?
I have tried saving like that_comma_ but I always end up spending it. That's bad
What play are you doing?
You can watch that play anywhere to help you practice.
How many days are you looking for the extension?
You should talk to her at least.
Did she surprise you with it?
That's so sweet!
wow i wish i could get my kids to do that. congrats
well it seems like he is starting out to become a productive person in life
Is that something they can do?
Can they move in and then not actually buy the house?
Thats a good outlook to have! What year are you on 1st_comma_ 2nd? 
Never give up_comma_ you never lose if you never give up. you got this 
That's a little strange
Used or new?
I can. Its good she achieved her dream.
Did you already make plans?
So what are you going to do? Reschedule?
What were your plans?
Weel you're not missing a concert you can go fishing another day.
That is great.  You must be an excellent parent!
He must be a good student too!
sorry to hear that.. what happened ? 
do you plan to look at getting another dog in the future?
Did you have a hard time in the class itself?
There's a lot of people who do not so well on tests_comma_ do you get another chance?
what medical test and why do you think the result couldn't be good?
Oh_comma_ sorry to hear that. Hope you'll get well soon.
did you take lots of pictures?
i can understand your pain.. feel the same way
Congratulations! I wish I could get a raise.
That's so true. I would take anything right about now.
S it because they are getting bigger?
I feel you. My 13 year old is the worst.
did you get more or less ?
oh wow.. thats horrible.. our butcher gives you a sample before slicing.. i find this the best way to verify 
Wow_comma_ that's great! You did a great thing by taking in a scared animal!
It's bringing a smile to my face just thinking about it!
That's great! Make sure to always stay with her_comma_ cruise ships are HUGE
lol_comma_ yes stay safe and wow what an experience! I am scared of the ocean but I know how amazing it would be though!
I'm really sorry to hear that :( What happened? I'm here for you if you wanna talk
Have you tried seeing a specialist? Or if you are religious to talk to the pastor? 
Wow_comma_ you should be an avid shooter!!
ah respect for the armed forces!!. Good luck with your new gun!! Hope you have a blast
no way!!! I hope you left the house!! I would_comma_ and probably would never come back
oh wow! I would probably kill that friend lol that's a mean prank
Why? What happened?
Oh my goodness_comma_ that's terrible.
does she have valid reasons ?
you should probably ask to go to couples counseling.. it works if you all are both trying to save your marriage
Wow!  I hate when things like that happen.  I had a similar thing where they would have to replace the whole front body for a small scratch.
Yeah_comma_ just keep an eye out for rust building up_comma_ but usually it isn't an issue.
I sorry the hear that.
You should seek revenge.
what have you tried doing to meet new people?
sounds like a good mix of different crowds
How come?
Everyone blooms on their own time_comma_ you'll get there_comma_ I promise.
How old is she? I havent experienced that yet with my daughter
Have you talked to her about it yet?
I was thinking that. I would need a day or two.
Does she live on her own?
That's great! Most of us like our independence. 
Oh no_comma_ How did happen? 
Yeah_comma_ I understand your concern. 
how so ? moneywise ?
i hear that 
That sounds like fun but I would be scared. I heard they are friendly tho. First time taking care of it? 
Im more scared about them biting me.. maybe one day ill be as brave as you. 
Eww. That is disgusting
How did they "put" it there? nevermind. Its just too much
You should still get one.
You need to write them down!
Do you not have anywhere to hide your passwords?
Congradulations 
Is this is first time? 
That must be a relief.
Maybe next time you should take a taxi.
by whom?
i can see that.. your vision is clouded sometimes.
I understand that feeling! Was it late?
Oh man! You do not have a car?
I know. So many bills_comma_ so little funds.
Oh. that has to be really stressful.
Maybe you should do something legally to protect them from themselves
I don't know what to tell you then. I've seen it before but not with me personally
Oh lol! I know_comma_ that is why I only watch stuff on the computer. More control over it
Oh yes they have some cool kids channels.
What was the reason?
Maybe you should try to speak with him again after things calm down.
Pretty good! how old is your son?
Yeah_comma_ you got the best son in the world!
That's great!  How did you go about it?
Trying on clothes is the worst.  I went through a weight loss recently_comma_ and it's definitely worth it in the end.  Keep vigilant to keep it off!
Are you talking about ones that just raise and raise prices?
And they always get nasty with you like it was your fault and not theirs! I feel you.
Awesome! What kind of car is it and what color?
Oh_comma_ well if you can get it soon you might want to start researching :)
What movie were you planning on seeing?
I understand that completely_comma_ well I hope you are able to go another day that you'd like
I don't think we are ready at any age to lose someone we love. I am so sorry about your Grandmother.
Take it one day at a time. Remember grief does not have a timetable. 
Oh man! I would have been so made_comma_ did you say anything to them?
Some people on think about themselves! I would have said something if he didn't look the fighting type. 
Oh wow.... a grown woman wetting the bed? Does she do it on purpose?
That is weird. I'm sorry_comma_ but she'd be out of my house! haha!
That was sweet of him!  Were you shocked because that's something that never happens?
I guess you need to go out more often so he can keep surprising you.
I know how you feel. That's everyone' family.
Me too.  There are only a couple of people I don't really like and I never have to see them because they live far away.
That is great_comma_ did you study a lot for it?
Well then great job_comma_ you earned it!
It's really easy if you think of it as a relative you don't really want to talk to_comma_ polite and to the point
It makes sure that you don't say anything inappropriate but you still feel semi comfortable! 
Oh No_comma_ how long were you out of work for? 
I am sure it was super stressful but I am so happy for you now and yes pop the bubbly! 
That sucks. I bet you felt bad. I am sure she forgave you though.
That's good. We all make mistakes sometimes.
how often do you visit them?
That is really nice of them seems you have a lovely family_comma_ when was the last time you saw them?
They announce a direct?
Are you a fan of super smash bros?
Do you like shakes? Where are they from?
That is a good question_comma_ I would be scared
Oh yeah what game system do you play that on? 
Ive never even heard of that so I guess I am getting old_comma_ google will be my friend later. 
That would make me mad_comma_ do you have carpet or hardwood?
Oh_comma_ well that is a good start then!
That is great_comma_ did you offer them the job?
Great_comma_ I hope they are not just a good interviewer_comma_ but a good worker as well!
Oh wow Red and Blue were the best gameboy games
Never got a chance to play that one_comma_ was it better?
Sorry_comma_ I have not played it myself. 
Yes_comma_ they do. I do love Mario Kart! I would expect the same excellence from all their games. I hope you have other games that you really enjoy.
You are going to nail it I bet. When is it? 
Read up about it on glassdoor thats a good one online! good luck :) 
What did you say to that?
Wow_comma_ congrats then_comma_ glad it worked out!
It's failed before. Just make sure you keep your hands on the wheel.... just in case.
That's cool. Have you driven it yet?
What!  That seems really fast!  Did you train alot?  That is amazing!
You must feel really good about yourself!  I would be if I could do that.
Yeah_comma_ same thing.  They've done so much for me that I just feel bad doing things against them.
That's family though.  Unless they're straight up abusive_comma_ it's just something you have to deal with from time to time.
Thats awesome i bet she will too! when does she start? 
woo hoo so you guys going out to celebrate? 
Are you gonna go home for the holidays?
Ah that makes sense_comma_ I love snow myself_comma_ but to each their own!
Really? I guess there a lot of people that think that as well. Do you still think that?
Yes_comma_ I have an iPhone now and like it pretty good too. I always had Androids before_comma_ but I do like Iphone a bit better too!
Yes_comma_ It's very classic game. 
Good! have a great game ahead!
Why is that?
I am sorry to hear that_comma_ I wish you luck!
Is it fully paid?
well congrats_comma_ enjoy yourself!
How old are you?
Do you have a job?
I am also not sure about it
Why do you love this
I agree_comma_ most jobs are painful but necessary.
I am confident that you will.
Why does that no longer happen?
You never too old to play catch!
Who did you say that to?
Oh_comma_ better apologize quickly there!
Same.. for me its because i work so much_comma_ and being a parent is so draining for me... i bought a new machine tho im going to start working out on friday. Try to find out whats causing it for you_comma_ and take 1 step to fix it you got this! 
One tiny baby step in the right direction and everything else will fall together piece by piece!!! 
Well_comma_ that's great! What a wonderful surprise too! I bet you really appreciated it.
It's nice that your parents were able to do that for you. I would have loved it too!
That is a jerk move.   What movie was it.
That sucks. Sorry your brother is a jerl.
Yikes_comma_ how did that happen?
That will do it_comma_ was everyone okay?
Did you study a lot for it?
Well I hope not_comma_ I am sure you passed!
I like it too_comma_ what is your favorite game?
I like those games too!
I was a kid then_comma_ but I remember my teachers reaction
I can imagine_comma_ that was a pretty big deal!
What happened in the past to make you so hesitant?
I see_comma_ well keep opening yourself up and learn to let people in
Oh_comma_ that sounds lonely :(
How about joining a club?
did you go alone or with a group?
it sounds like its scary
Oh how exciting_comma_ by yourself or with a group?
Thats awesome_comma_ I have always wanted to do an experience by myself
Awesome_comma_ sounds like he's ahead of f the curve. You must be proud.
Congradulations.
Oh my goodness_comma_ I'm so sorry.
I hope you feel better.
What are you going to eat?
Homemade or from a restaraunt?
They do i hate that_comma_ i dont know why but i always get them while in a call
have you tried calling your phone company to complain?
Well at 16 you have experienced alot of life and are ready to move on
Just be safe out there
Did you end up getting in?
That sucks_comma_ but that one was worth it I am sure!
Oh no I am sorry for your loss
You are welcome_comma_ keep your head up
What is the job you were trying to get?
Oh_comma_ well mauybe next time!
Good for you! My husband is lucky in the lottery_comma_ but I'm not. But_comma_ I would be excited about that $50 too!
You are probably like me_comma_ already figure you lost before you scratch the ticket lol. I'm glad you won!
That's is a really good thing_comma_ it helps build trust in a relationship.
Well_comma_ that is the way the world works now days. Nothing like it did in the past.
Oh_comma_ tell me more!
Oh I love Pikachu!
Have you considered tring to work out?
That's unforunate.
that is bad_comma_ are there other options?
that is okay then_comma_ but still anoying
Wow_comma_ I bet you were blown away. Where was the vacation at?
I have never been there_comma_ but heard a it's beautiful.
thats great_comma_ thats how you should be
yes unfortunately
Is it hot where you live?
I get that_comma_ I am sure it is not fun regardless
No need to be jealous_comma_ I am sure you are much better than him in certain areas.
I am sure you are much happier at home than he is...lol.
I don't blame you. I am always nervous at interviews. Don't worry_comma_ I'm sure you will do great!
You will be fine_comma_ just don't make yourself too nervous!
Did you help them out?
that is for sure_comma_ everyone has a ploy
Oh no. Did you fnd your dog?
I am so sorry to hear that. Have you tried calling your local shelters?
thats cool.  i hope it works out for you
im sure it will!
That's a bit rude if you ask me.
I can see why. Some people just don't know when to keep things to themselves.
That stinks. When did you get out?
Well_comma_ at least you got out
What did she want?
Ohh wow! Those are expensive I bet
Why were you irked?
Wow! what a jerk
Awesome_comma_ what field do you work in?
Ha_comma_ same.  Are you at work right now? 
that is awesome_comma_ what is she doing now?
well_comma_ good for her_comma_ that is an accomplishment for sure!
Good luck! I hope it goes well for you :)
How much is the house?
Awesome! Any idea what you're going to do with the money?
That's a really good idea. Better than blowing it on something now.
OH no_comma_ is she okay?
Oh great! Does she still ride?
thats nice of you_comma_ what does she like?
lucky you!
Oh man. I'm sorry. Do you still have a cordial relationship with your ex?
Have you talked to your friend?
That's no fun. Why not?
Well you can always try to make it better. Maybe you should try to get out more?
thats awesome_comma_ i bet they are thrilled
that is really cool
Oh no! That sounds so irritating. Have you tried talking to your boss about him?
That's understandable. He sounds clueless. I've had many coworkers like that_comma_ and the best way I've found to deal with them is run away as much as possible.
Wow_comma_ I'd be really nervous too. But I know you can do it!
Well is it after your lunch break? Maybe we can go out and have lunch_comma_ and I'll do my best to get you pumped up for it!
Oh man_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that.
Yeah_comma_ don't worry too much about it. There are plenty of others out there.
That sounds like such a thoughtful surprise! Did you enjoy it?
How come? Isn't the surprise half the fun?
That is terrible! Did you get it off?
Man_comma_ i would get new shoes!
That sucks.  Neither did I.   I know how you feel.
I ended up getting an internship then started working at the place... never finished the degree.
That sounds terrible_comma_ i would have cried!
I understand stand that for sure.
That's great_comma_ what kind of dog is it?
Oh wow I only have small dogs_comma_ I can't imagine training a big dog.
Is the boss aware or does he seem to skate by unnoticed? 
Is there an HR department you can take it to?
Sounds like it might be time to sit down with the boss and discuss your thoughts and feelings. If moral gets too low it's not good for anybody.
I hope it goes well! are you prepared?
I think you'll do great!
It's a good way to yo keep you two together.
Has he passed?
I'm so sorry to hear that. It must be stressful. Everything will get better.
Look into hotel. I feel into a hotel job after I lost my job years ago and not manage one. It's a great job. Just don't down on your self. 
I hope everything is okay.
That is a good attitude.
I would have slapped him so fast.
I would have just as mad as you are!
Wow_comma_ How lucky! I love to travel.
Wow_comma_ It must be a great job. I have a friend that works for a travel agency in Boston in a similar situation. She said since she started she has been to 32 different countries. 
Oh no_comma_ your a/c isn't working?! This is a bad time of year for that!
Man that's awful_comma_ I'm sorry. I hope you're able to get it fixed_comma_ and soon!
Aww man.. I am sorry.  Is she at least a good person?
Karma will get here someday.
That is amazing_comma_ care to share?
I wish_comma_ one day that I could get a check in the mail.
Oh no! Do you have any alternatives?
Oh I'm so sorry :( I hope you can find something suitable_comma_ even if you make it yourself
Wow_comma_ thats so sad. Has he been on the list long?
I'm sorry to hear your going through so much stress. My grandmother was on the heart Transplant list for about a month before getting a new heart. Maybe it will be that fast for him.
Thanks_comma_ she got the heart and is doing better. Wow_comma_ he is to young for this stress. Good Luck to him and you.
I'm sorry to hear that.  Maybe next time?
I hope you feel better about it.
That is terrible. What did you do about it?
Did you talk to her?
I'm sure. But it's a fresh start. Your the new person you can make people think any thing about you that you want.
Just be your self then. Who cares what they think.
Oh no_comma_ is there something wrong with your dog?
I know words don't really help in this situation_comma_ but I'm so sorry. I've lost many pets and it rips your heart out. I'm sure you're dog had a great life with you if it's any consolation.
Oh no! Were you prepared?
I bet you will make it up next time.
What about it?
That is very nice memories.
Do you want to yell at him and call him a liar?
One time i secretly called my boss's wife and outted him for an affair he was having with one of my coworkers.. lol he never knew..
that stinks i'm sorry
at least you didn't damage your bike
Gross!  What did you have to do?
Disgusting!  I am sorry you had to experience that!
Who was it?
Im sorry they did that.  That wasn't very cool.
Surely_comma_ it was just your imagination.
I can definitely see why all those things would scare you and make you think you saw a ghost.
That is great!  It is always nice when hard work is rewarded.
Well congratulations!  That is a good way to start the work week.
Oh goodness_comma_ I hope you are okay.
I really understand your concern.
That sucks.  I think that happens to everyone_comma_ accept the one girl who became a doctor.
Try not to let it get to you.  Life is weird.
I didn't understand.
That is a great achievement. You have been doing jousting for how long?
That is nice.
Oh no_comma_ that's messed up!
Hopefully your insurance will help out.
Eww that's so gross.
I bet_comma_ I wish some people had better manners.
That's scary. I wonder if they made it.
Maybe you will see something in the news in the next day or so.
Wow_comma_ you must be depressed. Life is short.
How is that so?
Heh that's so cute!
LOL! What did you do?
That's terrible! Can you do anything about it?
Wow_comma_ it sounds like you have a lot to be grateful for.
I am so happy for you.
Yay!  What type of dog?
I love a nice squishy face.  I have a Japanese Chin and 3 MinPin
yeah a lot like pekinese.. now you know why I have a 10 bedroom house!
Has it been on the market long?
I would be stressed each time it rains. I rented a place down state and Hurricane Sandy flooded our house. I can't imagine owning a place in a flood zone. 
Oh I'm so sorry_comma_ I'm here if you want to talk
Aw that's terrible :(
I hope you're well prepared!
That's good_comma_ you sound very prepared and I'm sure it'll be alright.
Oh no_comma_ that sounds scary.
Thank goodness it wasn't something serious.
That can be embarrassing.  Are you ok?
Sounds painful.  I hope you didn't cause any damage.
That is good_comma_ you must be very religious.
That is very nice of you to help those that are needy.
Watch out State Farm!  lol.  Congratulations!
That is awesome.  She can drive for you now!
Oh yeah.  I just quit smoking myself.  You should try something to distract you.
Nice!!  I'm trying to stay away from any form of smoking for now.
They can not curt you. They are tiny and powerless. 
don't eat them then.
He was certainly very intelligent_comma_ you can definitely increase your own knowledge though if you work at it.
Try reading some books or maybe practicing math problems I guess.
That isn't good. What did you do when you stepped in the poop?
Did you throw the sandals away or just clean them?
I guess you were pretty hungry then_comma_ huh? Well_comma_ I'm sure your friend doesn't mind sharing!
Well_comma_ all you could do was apologize and offer to buy another one. He'll get over it_comma_ I'm sure!
That's nice. Have you always done that?
I've never been a person of faith. My parents weren't either.
I've never driven a truck_comma_ only small vehicles! How's that working out for you?
Aw_comma_ I'm glad you have something like that to remember him by. That's a great connection to him to have.
Oh my! I really hope that you find your stuff. Do the cops have any leads?
Well I really hope that your insurance was able to cover what you lost. 
That is great. It is always good to have some recognition for the good job done.
That is nice.
Why would you ever move away from the Caribbean.
Where did you move to after the hurricane?
Sounds great_comma_ i've never been but would love to.
How many times you've been?
That's awesome!  How much did you win?
$100 bucks still sounds great to me!
Addiction is a scary thing! I wish him the best.
Yes it takes a lot of courage to do that.
That's nice of her_comma_ it's good you have such a caring mother.
Yes I'm very grateful for my mother for taking very good care of me.
She takes care of me the best she can.
Your friend takes care of me the best he can.
Awesome. I was in Sturgis in 2004. Did you ride out or trailer your bike?
Lucky_comma_ be careful some people can get carried away out their. 
where is it shipping from? is it a reputable store?
yeah. hopefully you will have better luck with it.
Oh no! That sounds awful! What a kind thing to do though! Im sure they were very grateful for your help!
I hope you took the right precautions not to get it yourself! I can only imagine that_comma_ I have never had it and never want to!
Is it an engineering job or something else.
That is great. Would you be an astronaut then?
That is very nice of you to try to help the turtles.
That is very odd. Hopefully they won't get killed anymore.
No I haven't 
I hate it when my team loses too. All that time invested for a loss is disappointing. 
Do you like your job or is this something you dread?
Well I hope you find something you love and you're happy to do. Still searching for that myself.
Which supplies did you get?
Oh that sounds like fun!
Where to? What location?
Wow_comma_ you will be fine. Years ago I went to Japan to teach English and also got called to duty and spent time in Iraq and a few other places. Once you arrive it's never as bad as you will have it built in your head.
I hate the summer honestly_comma_ the winter is great for me.
I love the cold. it keeps me cool when i sleep.
Oh great. That is so fun . My baby died a few years ago. But he was over 14 _comma_ so. 
Thanks. At least he lived a pretty good long time . He was a beagle mix named Jack.
I'm sorry.. my first gut reaction was to laugh a little. I really don't mean to make fun of you. That's terrible! Was it because you didn't want to miss a part of the movie_comma_ so you tried to hold it in as long as possible?
The movie did? It sounds like maybe at least it was a good movie_comma_ if that's any consolation. I hope no one made fun of you. It's a common human mistake.
I have never been to an airport honestly.
I like to stay home where I know i'm a little saffer.
Maybe tell him how you feel about that.
Punch him right in the nose_comma_ that will fix things i'm sure!
That's too bad. Are you going to replace it?
Maybe you will be able to replace it soon. What happened to it?
That's a way to make a buck! Ebay?
You are my hero.
I see that more in the country I guess. That would be horrifying. But maybe he is just immune to pain?
Sounds like he was ok. I've had injuries before and they weren't serious enough or worth the hassle of the emergency room. But he still had to take a trip to go somewhere. Don't be afraid to care though :) One person is all that is needed- Kindness is always good!
Neurofeedback? I don't even know what that is! Could you fill me in a little bit? And why did you need to learn about it?
That is really interesting. Still over my head_comma_ but you did a decent job of explaining it in layman's terms. I appreciate it. So are you a med student_comma_ or what?
Holy cow... That is really awesome. That's nice of you to dedicate your free time like that. I sincerely hope everything works out. I appreciate you sharing that.
oh i love looking at old photos
my nieces and nephews are all growing up on me and my step kids are almost adults too. it goes by in a blink of an eye
Oh wow!! I love pyrex stuff. I bet it brought back many memories. 
Its funny how items can bring back such good memories. 
I hope they weren't expensive shoes.
That's a shame. Does your dog chew on shoes often?
I hear you. I'm not ready to go back either. 
I'm sure it will be ok. A new year is a new time to reinvent yourself. 
I live in a small town with no car.
I want to get a car one day i think.
I would just go to the beach right now!
Not mine at all_comma_ i enjoy my house.
 I bet that was a nice surprise. Why did you get it?
You are lucky then. Always good to receive things you arent expecting. 
I'm in college_comma_ so i'll be your friend.
 I wish I could be with you and not in school
Did you just recently find out?
Does it upset you? Just think_comma_ the family that raised you_comma_ actually pursued you and love you.
Where that happened?
What did you call to get towed?
Maybe you should go by yourself. Normally wifes stay at home and clean.
Maybe if you go somewhere else without the girl.
Oh my gosh I hope you were ok!
I'm really sure you will figure it out. 
Maybe pray and she will hear you.
Maybe she could if you tried.
Adulting is hard that's for sure. Start playing it and streaming and make some money.
I just read that youth was wasted on the young. lol Kind of apropos.
It's funny how you learn things as you get older even if you aren't doing major things. Little things you can learn a lot from
Sorry to hear that. You sound like a hard worker_comma_ which is something to be proud of_comma_ even though it's kind of wearing you out maybe. Are you able to roll the days over to next year and save them_comma_ at least?
That's kind of a lame policy. I hope you get to use them at some point_comma_ because they should be worth something. If you're just physically unable to because of the job and its demands_comma_ and then they end up passing you by_comma_ that doesn't seem fair. I hope you get to relax during the holidays_comma_ then.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I hope everything works out for you.
I think I'm too young for that but man wouldn't that be nice today?
I'm sure they were_comma_ I can barely afford to survive.
Lol. Did you dare look inside?
That is bad.  I  always try to remember how long stuff has been in there_comma_ but sometimes things hide on you in there.
Weird.. that happened to me last year.  In Baltimore..
That is horrible.. I am sorry!  Mine got closed after a scandal that was on Netflix
Same here and its hard when your school doesn't exist anymore
Yeah that would be awesome!  What are you going to spend it on??
Heck yeah!  That sounds like fun!  
My weekend was pretty okay. Did anything special happen for you?
Wow! Have you always fished as a hobby? I've never been.
ours is a family table too so i understand what you mean. i really need to refinish it
a little. i am hoping my mother in law will be able to help me with it. she's done it before successfully.
it's worth it to keep a family herloom
Oh no_comma_ do you know why it could've happened?
So it could be something wrong with the soil? I'll keep my fingers crossed for you.
oh no. did you know the spirit you contacted?
i would totally freak out
I am so sorry... What happened?
Is he ok now?
What's wrong?
Remember safety is the first priority of amusement parks_comma_ everything will be just fine!
Hey that sounds exciting!!  Are you ready?
Yeah I would be pumped too!  Is it coming with a raise as well?
Oh man!!  Make sure to put some back for retirement or emergency fund!!
Do you feel negative about it_comma_ or positive? It's hard to tell from your sentence. Maybe you feel both ways. If I were in your shoes_comma_ I could see how you would start to feel some more pressure in that situation. I was always the youngest child_comma_ so I never had pressure on me to accomplish anything by a certain time. If you're not happy about it_comma_ hopefully you can turn it into a positive so that your sister doesn't get any undue negativity.
I can understand why you'd start to feel that way. I think it's good that you want to look inward instead of just blatantly blaming other people. That means you can start to look for ways to make you feel better about yourself_comma_ that are solutions! But nothing has to be "wrong with you." For some_comma_ it just takes time. For others_comma_ they find it easier to accept someone to settle down with.
That seems like a short train ride compared to say_comma_ going across country or something! Are you going to be sleeping on it overnight?
They really do feel that way! There's actually a train in Africa_comma_ I want to say Kenya? Where it is like stepping back in time and you go on a week long journey on the train_comma_ you have to dress fancy and it seems like a dream come true.
That's awesome!  I bet you're a proud parent! 
Is he getting any gifts because he's done so goo?!
That sounds like a lot of fun!
That is cool!  I bet you all had a really great time
Was it enjoyable?
What did you do on the train?
Did you clean the house yourself or hire someone to do it?
How long did it take you to clean your house?
That sounds nice. How come you didn’t go with?
I am with you there.  I hope you get a chance to go there sometime though. 
I'm sorry_comma_ why can't you go out?
Oh that's not fun.
Did you ask the kid or the kid's parents to stop kicking your chair?
How long was the flight you were on?
Holy cow that's awesome!  Are we taking the kids??
oh haha!  Is this your first time?
Myself as well friend_comma_ i love vacation.
I do not like the beach_comma_ too much sand.
That sounds fun to go to.
I love going to the movies and getting food!
Oh_comma_ why did you cheat on her?
It's a man's world_comma_ isn't it.
Hey that's good.  What was wrong with it?
That's pretty awesome.  I don't guess it cost too much then.
How fun. How big was your catch?
thats a big one. I bet it was scary. Did you eat it?
Oh my goodness_comma_ I bet that was embarrassing!!! 
Well it happens to everyone i wouldnt let it keep bothering you. Just laugh it off!
That is terrible.  Did you get hurt badly?
Were there a lot of people around?
Must be nice!  Do you think he will let you ride it?
I would be too_comma_ those things are really nice. 
Oh_comma_ that sounds like a hassle.
Oh that's not cool_comma_ get a different one.
Uh oh!!  I hope it wasn't a prank lol
I bet.  I would be too!  Was the food good??
Florida is so nice. Are you going for work or pleasure?
Thats a lot of miles_comma_ but they make cars good these days. 
Oh no!  Happens to the best of us.  Are you feeling better now?
Oh no!  I would hope that people had compassion for your situation and if they didn't_comma_ well shame on them.  I once peed my pants at a wedding I was laughing so hard. 
Oh no! But I think black snakes are good? They eat nasty bugs and rodents!
Oh wow_comma_ that's a big snake!
Oh wow_comma_ what was the award for?
Oh congratulations! You are a true hero
That is so sweet.  How did he lose his leg?
I've heard that it doesn't bother them to lose one limb.  I watch Dr. Jeff on Animal Planet a lot and that is what he says.
I'm so sorry.  I have dealt with a lot of sleep problems and night panic attacks so I know how hard it can be dealing with things like that. I have a friend who does the same thing. Don't be humiliated.  You can't control it.
I hate those things!  They are so restrictive.  I wish I could remember the name of the medication that my friend is on that helped her...let me check with her and see if she texts me back.
Don't feel any shame.  The medication is called Topomax.  It supposedly stops the receptors in the brain that trigger night sleep eating.  I also know that if you happen to take Ambien_comma_a sleeping pill_comma_ go off of it because it actually can cause night sleep eating. Take care!
Ugh! They do that here too! Are you in a bad city too?
Did you find out who did it?
Oh really_comma_ I was unaware of that.
That is quite interesting.
That's great. You have to buy a new one every so often as the motors get weak in them.
I love the way carpet feels after you use a brand new vacuum on it. Almost like it's new again.
That sounds really dramatic! What's the matter? What's making you so unsure about it?
I can understand trying to abide by one's intuition... Are you going on your flight to somewhere where you have something important to do or someone to meet? Perhaps it may be unfair to them or that situation if you don't go through with it. If you want to do it_comma_ try your best to think of all the repercussions_comma_ and to weigh the pros and cons_comma_ and to not let your intuition cloud your judgment.
I think it's an adjustment you have to work through. Toddlers can really test anyone's patience!
It's really hard_comma_ especially being thrown into an environment with a two year old and not having them for a consistent basis from when they were younger up until now.
Oh! I hear you_comma_ I love them but I get sick when I eat them. Did you do okay?
That's unusual. Are you allergic to something they are fried in or just potatoes in general? I have digestive issues so I get tired too when I eat junk food
That's terrible! Sorry to hear that.
So do I. People need to be more considerate of others.
Well_comma_ sometimes we can feel that way in life. Relieved because there isn't drama_comma_ but get a bit lonely. Maybe you can get out and meet some new people?
Well_comma_ whatever makes you happy_comma_ that's what you should do. But_comma_ still_comma_ never hurts to at least have platonic friends :)
Congrats to him!  What type of skating?
Oh_comma_ now I understand.  He is skateboarding. 
Oh no. Have you been stressed about anything?
You sound nervous.
I don't blame you. It can be scary...the more people there are- the worse they drive. Be careful!
For sure! And always check for the wreckless drivers and the ones who cut you off- Thats really bad in bigger cities. Can never be too careful.
Definitely. The world is an extremely complex thing_comma_ and I don't know if we'll ever fully understand it.
I would imagine that people who have certain personality types are typically drawn to becoming doctors. They all seem to be very compassionate! 
That's an interesting thing to know! Have you thought about doing it as a hobby?
If it makes you feel peace of happiness_comma_ definitely!
Oh hey! A fellow bird feeder. Did you eventually get some?
That's good. Sometimes we forget to do things that matter to us.
That's good_comma_ have you been having trouble?
I'll say. You can appreciate it that much more. What made the difference_comma_ if I may ask?
Oh man_comma_ the flu in summer?1
Oh geez! Was it a quick flu
Wow! Great wife_comma_ Cherish her! Stack up on good vitamin C and good Elderberry when you're well to keep the flu away :)\
Oh god...lol- I HATE being sick...When I get sick..it's BAD- So let's hope lol
That is great you showed the initiative to apply.  It is common to be a bit nervous.
Just think positive thoughts and I am sure you will get the news shortly
That sounds relaxing! How was the weather?
I love when everything just seems to work out together. Im glad you enjoyed!
That is really good.  In this economic climate it is good to have something like that to count on.  What do you do?
That's great.  I am glad you're doing well.
I am so so sorry to hear that. 
I know this is so hard for you but he is in no more pain and I am sure he is watching over you
What was the drawing of?
You said that already_comma_ how long did it take you to draw this picture?
Thats exciting! where are you going??
Is that a country? i know the name but not the geography.
Oh no!!  That is awful.  I hope you are okay :(
I bet.  Nothing is worse than losing a friend suddenly like that.   Keep your head up_comma_ friend.
That sounds like fun!
Oh that is so cool! You must be a great relative.
That is awful. I would definitely not pay and never go back again.
They will lose a lot of business over that one. Word of mouth is the best way to hurt someone. That is gross and I wouldn't go back either.
That is so wonderful!  I have the same kind of husband.  Aren't we lucky?  It gives me hope for when my daughter grows up and finds someone.
Oh wow_comma_ your daughter is a lot closer than mine whose just 8.  I already worry about it.  I know they'll find some upstanding men but they can take their time in finding them! ha ha.
Glad you made it_comma_ what happened to almost be short?
That was very nice of your grandma. How much did she cover?
I know. It was so shocking and sad.
That was a great movie!
That is good!  Why have you been feeling down about the future before?
Staying positive can be very hard_comma_ but it helps to be around the right people.
OHHH! Those are nice! How much was it if you don't mind me asking?
Great! That is how it should work. Not one guy making a ton more_comma_ as it takes everyone to make it work :)
Why are you alone? did you just move?
Was it a significant other? was it the correct decision?
Sorry?
No problem! I have done it before. Oh wow! That sounds nice_comma_ are they still together? I hope.
Understandable. But remember there are always private things. No relationship is perfect. It takes both working hard
Congratulations! That is awesome!  I don't really have much luck in winning things.  Have you won anything else before in your life?
That is so cool. I have been drooling over an iPad!  Is it amazing??
Oh man_comma_ good luck! Make sure to have a book/music on hand at least to help distract you
I think that would help. Is it for vacation?
I have never seen any of the new Star Wars movies.
I have not been to the movies in a long time. It is very expensive to go these days.
I'm so sorry_comma_ were they impressed?
I would imagine they were quite delighted.
I totally feel for her. I have lost many the past year. It's hard
That was nice of you. Having company helps through grief.
Has something changed lately?
That is a very good attitude that you have!
What was the exam for?
When will you get the results for this exam?
I hate the dentist. It always makes me nervous. Are you going for a checkup?
Oh no :( That sucks. I hope it's only one
Oh that is fantastic!!!  I bet you're proud of him!
That's pretty cool!  You sound like an awesome grandparent! :D
That is cool_comma_ did you teach him how to fish?
I am sure he didn't let you hear the end of that.
that sounds like a nice sunday
hopefully it happens again soon!
wow thats a huge pain
i know what you mean
I hope so! I hate driving but good luck.
Good_comma_ that's really important thing.
That's great! Congratulations! That's exciting_comma_ and I'm sure if you're confident she will_comma_ then she will!
Oh_comma_ okay. Well_comma_ that is a bit different_comma_ but good luck!
I'm sorry.  It sounds like you had a tough life.
I could not have said it better myself.
Oh lord_comma_ why did you do that?
You pay your gramma back and stop drinking. Seriously
How are you ready?
What kinds of snacks do you have for it?
How did he win a lot of money?
Does he play the scratcher tickets a lot?
oh yea something else insane?
that makes no sense.
O that sounds delicious_comma_ any idea what you'll get?
Sounds delicious_comma_ get some queso too!
Sadly_comma_ I agree with you.  As I get older_comma_ it seems like that more and more.  What happened that made you feel that way?
Its so true! I battle chronic illness and excruciating pain daily for almost 14 years now not to mention drowning in old medical bills.  I put my faith in God and pray for relief.  Its really hard to stay optimistic.  I really hope life improves for you and you can enjoy and embrace life again.  
That is exactly what I've been going through along with horrible doctors that did nothing for me.  I just went high nutrient vegan 3 months ago and am improving my leaps and bounds.  I follow Dr. Joel Furhman.  You can keep going and your journey is giving you compassion for others that are going through horrible things.  Take heart and I hope you feel better.  
I hear you! It's sad yet happy to think of how great it was years ago! I hope we get to keep our good memories when we leave this world
I know right <3. Such a great time when we weren't the adults as well! lol- Paying bills is no fun.
How were you dancing?
Were they expensive pants?
Why? Are you scared to ride it? I can relate_comma_ so if that's the case_comma_ just skip it.
Oh_comma_ I see_comma_ so it's kind of a have-to scenario. Well_comma_ I always let my hubby do that_comma_ but maybe you're the hubby too lol. 
Sure! If you've never ridden it_comma_ then you really should. 
You are very lucky you didn't crash your car while driving.
Yes_comma_ how much did it cost to fix the tire?
it looks like it's going to be good!
Me too... those are my favorite type of movies
Oh goodness_comma_ what happened?
Oh no_comma_ you must be devastated.  I'm sorry.
Ohh gosh! What happened. That's so terrifying
Oh_comma_ I feel sorry for you.
Thats good_comma_ do yall live in the same town?
my mother lives far away_comma_ and I live with my father_comma_ but its not ideal
Oh my god that’s hilarious. 
Oh no I am so sorry about that. Did everything turn out ok?
Oh_comma_ what caused them to move out?  Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
I see. I'm sorry you're home alone.  I get lonely myself when you're used to someone around.  Are you going to advertise for a new roommate?
Do you have any children already or will this be your first?
Do you know if it is a boy or girl?
That is irritating_comma_ huh.  It is like a kid that can't stand not having the attention for a minute so they act up.  Haha
It just wants you off the phone instead.  
I hope you didn't drink the soup. They better of given you the meal for free.
Oh_comma_ I thought it was a t a restaurant.
Nah.  Don't worry my friend!  It will be okay!
I don't think they will.  We are the worlds greatest army
What position does your nephew play?
Is your nephew a big kid?
Oh no! What did he do?
Yes_comma_ little brothers can sometimes be irritating.  Maybe ask him next time to turn it down?
Where did you go? You went alone?
That is awesome_comma_ I've been there when I was a kid and had a lot of fun!
That is crazy! what was your original major?
How are you faring in todays climate?
That's not good_comma_ what is the contract dispute about?
Yeah_comma_ that's always rough. I would take them to court if it's in the 4 digit range.
I haven't been.  I would really love to go_comma_ and it's good to hear such a good review from someone.
What else is there to do there other than see the falls?
Good for YOU! Integrity is very rare nowadays
I feel the same way!
Did you cry when you were looking at the photos?
My niece lives in Los Angeles. I do not get to see her very much.
That is wonderful!  How many kids do you have?  That's a tough job but so rewarding!
I have 2 kids.  I love being home with them as well. I am blessed to be able to work at home.  I also homeschool them and love teaching! Are you having any more kids?
That is awesome!  How long were they away 
I am so happy for you!
Great! What kind of job is it?
Sounds great! Better pay is always good!
That is a great surprise.   I bet you are very thankful.
Do you know what you are going to spend it on?
I would not want to be in your position it's ok to help but all the time it can be dreadful. 
It will get better put your foot down and maybe say no in a nice way to not step on any ones toes.
That's awesome! congratulations too!  What do you do?
Oh nice! My brother in law is a lawyer and I remember him trying to get certain jobs he wanted and it not being easy sometimes.  Sounds like you are a great lawyer.  Hope it goes well for you!
Wow congrats! What type of music do you play?
Nice_comma_ I really like folk music. I hope you guys put off a great show.
Oh what a scene. How did it make you feel?
You are so lucky to have a family like that!
oh my lord_comma_ please say thats not true.
that is one of the most horrible things ive ever heard.
I would be mad! Did she say why she didn't bring you anything?
Maybe you could talk to her after you calm down a bit.  I'm sure there is a reason.
Aw I'm sorry.  Why are you lonely?
Maybe you could invite a friend over for a movie?
Maybe you could facetime your wife.
That sounds really frustrating! Who mows their lawn that early holy cow!
Wow I would be mad to. 
Gee_comma_ that is too bad. I wonder why Becky got it and you didn't?
Yeah_comma_ that's no fun. Maybe you'll get offered the next promotion that is available? 
What day is that?
Oh lord..that gives me chills just hearing the word. What was it on?
Do you have more than one dog??
I feel like this is obvious_comma_  but is he white?
That sounds awesome! I've only ever been to Florida in order to get to Disney World. Are you there to visit family? Business? To sight-see?
Yeah... I had to do a long drive from Nebraska to Colorado this summer. It was about a 7-hour drive. That was starting to push it. So_comma_ I could see 9 hours being a little rough. I just tried to load up on podcasts to listen to.
Oh that's awful!  I hope he is going to be okay.  Did they lay him off with severence or anything?
Yeah.  He will get to spend more time with you all now!  Take the father on a vacation!
I lad you was ok did anyone help you or was you embarrassed? 
Now that was mean and cruel nothing funny about that best outcome is you are fine be careful next time.
Oh boy.  That's no good.  Did the credit card company alert you or did they miss it too?
I bet.  I can't believe they didn't alert you.  Were they able to take care of it for you and suspend the charges and the account?
Oh goodness_comma_ is she okay?
I really wish the best for y'all.  Good health.
That was nice of him. You should take him out for dinner.
That is impossible thou. It is a dog eat dog world out there.
Congratulations. Do you have any party planned for this event?
That is cool. Are you going alone or with friends?
You shouldn't let those kind of people upset you.
Maybe you should move out? Have you thought about that.
Oh! Yeah I understand that_comma_ maybe they will take you?!
Oh yes of course! I am sorry.
That's so nice. Is he doing better now?
I'm sure it was a great comfort to you. Food is a great way to tell someone you care. 
That's great. My mother is like that too_comma_ and it's easy take for granted_comma_ but not all are so lucky !
You sure are! At least you appreciate and acknowledge so I'm sure she is pretty glad to have you as her child.
Yes_comma_ all the time! My girlfriend always thinks I'm so weird.
I'm sorry to hear that. We all have our demons. Sometimes it's good to take one day at a time and try to stay positive. 
Good to hear! What is the subject?
That's something to be proud of! Good job!
I'm not sure what that is. Tell me about it?
Oh_comma_ okay_comma_ I believe I know what you are talking about now. He is a good actor and usually his movies are great!
I hope you wasn't to disappointed was you to going to spend time together? 
A simple call would have been nice hopefully he has a good explanation for this. 
Can you really put a price on pizza?
I understand_comma_  If a pizza is more than 10 dollars_comma_ im not paying.
That must be so annoying.
I'm sorry_comma_ maybe one day when he gets older.
Oh no! I hope you didn't have to go anywhere the next day? Did you try anything to help?
Oh_comma_ well that's a bonus! No one needs sleep on christmas lol
Can't you just live with someone?
Well_comma_ dogs are good for protection.
That stinks. Did you hurt your foot?
I read that wrong_comma_ I thought you said you tripped over a vase and it broke. Will you be in trouble if she finds out?
Oh no!  Its always tough in relationships but when you can't go see her or make her talk to you afterwards_comma_ I'm sure its extra hard.  Did you call back and tell her that?
I'm sure once she calms down_comma_ she will look on it as not as big of a deal.  If you have to work_comma_ you have to work.  I hope you can work it out!  
Hahaha. I'm so sorry_comma_ but that made me laugh. I really don't mean to make you feel like I'm thinking you're dumb_comma_ because I don't. Everyone makes that mistake. I have an old Honda Civic_comma_ and I run into that problem_comma_ too. You probably gave the locksmith a good story to tell_comma_ and made his day. Hopefully you can smile at it tomorrow.
Oh man_comma_ he didn't charge you? You both kind of won then! A good story for you both at no cost. Well_comma_ except for time. It was a good learning lesson. And yeah.. the bumper sticker.. that's crazy. I'm glad you're able to not take yourself so seriously. That makes for a great personality.
Oh_comma_ well_comma_ I guess that was a bit disappointing huh. Well_comma_ maybe you can go real soon.
Oh_comma_ well_comma_ you're going to have to say_comma_ "Mom_comma_ I know you're tired but I really want to see this movie_comma_ can we please just go? It'll be fun_comma_ we need time together".
I understand.  Tell me about it.
Yes_comma_ one day at a time.
Woo hoo! What were you promoted too?
That's great! What kind of tasks do you do?
That's an interesting way to get attention. What spurred that on? Was it a dare_comma_ or was he just feeling wild?
Interesting.. Did he get in trouble? Was this at a high school or something? And does he take gymnastics?! Back flips are hard!
Do you guys fight often?? How do they usually turn out?
Are your political views the same? and do you think this next fight will end well?
I'm really sorry to hear that. What's worse is the best thing for breakups_comma_ the only thing that really helps_comma_ is time passing by. But the people who are hurting_comma_ in the moment_comma_ they can't really understand or accept that. So_comma_ you feel like you have to help and do something_comma_ when in reality it's probably best you don't smother them and that they have space. I hope she feels better_comma_ though.
Yeah_comma_ that's a good idea. That's always a solid way to go about it. My roommate had a breakup 6 months ago. I tried not to give any advice that was too specific_comma_ because the best solution always has to come from that person themselves. My roommate ended up just focusing on himself as much as possible_comma_ diving into artistic endeavors_comma_ trying to work out_comma_ etc.
That is disappointing. Did you confront them about it? I am sorry you have to deal with that.
That's too bad. Lesson learned_comma_ I guess.
That sounds stressful! How far did you move?
That's quite a ways. Do you have any hobbies that could help you meet new people?
Well_comma_ that's wonderful and I know it really is so great to hear your child's first words!
For Sure. Before you know it_comma_ he'll be saying full sentences!
That is always true. The saying goes..water your own grass.
Find some good books and good therapy and make your life what you want it to be. If you truly love your partner then don't lose them over feelings. Feelings are fleeting.
Yeah_comma_ I do. I'm in a long distance relationship. I get that everytime I have to fly back home. I hope you start to feel better_comma_ though. Loneliness can end up being a good motivator_comma_ however.
Ah_comma_ your situation sounds complicated. I'm sorry you have to deal with that. It sounds like you've given a lot of thought though_comma_ and the way you lay it out_comma_ you sound very mature about it. You've developed a good perspective on it_comma_ one that I should learn to appreciate myself. With your temperament_comma_ I'm sure you won't suffer from loneliness very long. People will want to be around you_comma_ as long as you want them around you.
You sound like you've dealt with more hardship than the average person. I wish I could empathize with you_comma_ but I've been lucky to avoid that kind of thing recently. But I do hope things will turn out differently for you soon. If anything_comma_ these things will make you more resilient than the average person_comma_ too. That's not worth nothing.
Do you feel their weight?
Sounds exciting. Will you do it again?
Are they usually a winning team?
Oh wow_comma_  I hope they do well.  
Wow_comma_ that must be scary to have to trust someone else with all of your stuff. What took you out of the country?
A two month vacation sounds amazing! I figured it was for work or something when you said two months. What is your favorite thing to do in the Bahamas?
That is worrisome but also exciting. Is it your first child?
Congratulations. I wish you the best of luck. Parenthood is a blessing.
That sucks_comma_ how old was the goldfish?
What did you do with Goldie after she died?
Aw.  I bet that is so bittersweet. Do they graduate next May?
That is a good sign!  I know many kids that age who have no direction so it sounds like he's really going places.  Do you have any other kids that will still be at home?
What is the certification exam for?
My father was an architect. So I have heard about these exams.
I hear you! Life is SO busy_comma_ never enough hours in the day!
Oh lol! It's ok_comma_ you are a mom and it's the hardest job EVER and very thankless. You are doing good
Yes I do hate being all alone. That's how I feel when my boyfriend leaves town for work.
Yes you have to do what is best for yourself. Take care of you before others.
Right on_comma_ that sounds cool. Did you go with family_comma_ or a date? Or maybe just hung out there alone? That's okay_comma_ too. I love Italian food_comma_ had always wanted to go to Olive Garden_comma_ but my dad hates Italian. So when we were growing up_comma_ we just never went. Now that I'm on my own_comma_ I've been... twice. Both times_comma_ they were just okay.
It can be cheap to go there sometimes for an easy filling meal_comma_ with the deals and coupons they have_comma_ I think. With the bread and soup you can get. I hope you guys had a good time! 
I'm sorry the hear that.  Maybe another company would appreciate your talent.
The first job out of college is a good way to test the waters but someday you will have to spread those wings.
Just take your time and don't get so nervous you got this. 
Great to have some hands on help parallel parking is very hard but once down packed it is easy.
That's ok.  Employers don't look at your grades I don't think.
It sounds like you have determination_comma_ and that is worth more than a 4.0
Yeah it should be a good one. Who is your favorite team?
Hope Dak has a good year! I am all about the tailgating.
That must have been somewhat weird.
Oh goodness_comma_ that is so creepy!
That sounds so exciting get ready for sleepless nights and long nights gambling. 
Know your limit once you start gambling it will make it much easier so you won't go broke.
I'm sorry_comma_ but I don't envy you... I've always just driven a little sedan. I'm an alright driver_comma_ but if I had to drive something bigger_comma_ I'd be nervous_comma_ too. Too easy for me to make mistakes. I kind of dread the day where I'll have to drive a big Uhaul truck. I hope things go well for you_comma_ though.
Well_comma_ as long as you're patient and careful_comma_ you'll minimize your mistakes. There are those who go out there and think they know everything. Even if they're a good driver_comma_ they may be more likely to slip up and have a problem than you would. So_comma_ just stay positive!
Maybe you can observe what she's doing and use that to advance in the industry as well.
I'd be worried about having these kinds of feelings towards your wife.
That does sound creepy. What did you do?
Clowns are scary. Did you make it out safe?
Oh that is pretty cool. Were there any clowns there?
That is good to hear. I like the ones that are funny better.
Did it turn out to be a great event even though the bands was unknown? 
That is good to hear I would enjoy a night with some great music. 
That sounds scary! What was it?
Oh no. Are there other people at home with you?
That was nice of them. What movie do you want to see?
You should see 8th grade. Nice story about a girl growing up. You will like it.
That is very impressive. Do you know what languages they are?
wow_comma_ I bet Chinese is one the State Department really needs right now. I hope your friend gets the job.
Wow. You can wear yoga pants to work? I'd like that dress code!
Ah I'm glad that's over for you then. Now you're less likely to forget doing laundry again.
Oh no_comma_ are you worried about her? Do you think she will be faithful?
Yes I agree_comma_ guys are a little let reliable sometimes. 
Wow. That is impressive! I can't even do a cartwheel on a mat.
Maybe she is part kangaroo afterall.
That
AH-HEM! What I meant to say prior to my keyboard malfunction was...that sounds really neat! Where are you going to go camping?
People really need to be more respectful. What did you do?
He deserved it_comma_ that scumbag.
That is scary. I hope she wasn't too shaken up from it.
That is very true. Well I am glad she is OK. Thanks for sharing about it.
It must be nerve wrecking especially since it has so much impack on your job.
Try to stay calm and do your best. Good luck!
That sounds exciting! When are you going?
It's good to focus_comma_ but surely you can take a few hours to take in the culture.  China has a long and interesting history.
i hate that!
hahaha...aww..cant give away the pupper
That's too bad. What's Your favorite dish?
Those are really good. I am more of a burrito man myself.
thats amazing! where did they take you?
you are very lucky_comma_  is greek your favorite food?
That is awesome. Did you get to do anything fun with her?
Cool I like Harry Potter. You have a really nice aunt!
Congratulations! Any plans to lose more?
that's great. were you losing for a special occasion or just to feel better?
Oh.. i am so sorry to hear that my friend.. I understand your feelings. Have you thought about getting a new pet?
I feel you.. When my pet dunken passed away_comma_ i got a new dog_comma_ named him dunken and restarted our relationship from there
That's awesome! And crazy... And scary... and awesome all at once! You must kinda feel accomplished though_comma_ huh? Good to hear that everyone is happy and healthy. Kind of weird how you all will have that special_comma_ unique bond for the rest of your lives_comma_ now. 
It's funny_comma_ you guys walked into work that day and thought it'd be another usual_comma_ boring day. You clocked out maybe with some blood on your shirt_comma_ smelling like newborn. Awesome.
Wow. I definitely would take it up wiht your credit card.
They really should be more considerate. allergies are a serious medical concern.
What happened? Did you ask her to go out on a date?
Yeah_comma_ that happens all the time with me. Well_comma_ actually_comma_ it doesn't_comma_ since I can't text because I wear Hulk Hands all the time. I just smash things.
Wow. Why did he do that?
If he wasn't happy with the food_comma_ there arebetter ways to tell you.
Not sure what an emu is. I hope you find him/her!
Maybe she just wanted to go play. I hope she comes back.
That really sucks. That would have been an instance to cry over SPILLED milk indeed!
Never thought about that. Thank god you recovered it!
that is awesom!!!
hahaah...thats too cute
Aw_comma_ that's so sweet of you. Did it work?
That's really nice. The world needs more people like you.
damn dog _comma_ thats disappointing to here 
 i would be really angry
Sounds impressive. Did you finish all of them?
That's really good! Did they give you a raise?
Nice! How is your business doing nowadays?
That's really great. I am proud of your success.
oh my lord! only ten?
I think you can do it! I mean is there really a limit to the amount of bigmacs one can eat?
Oh that sounds wonderful! Are you going to visit the zoo?
I here they have one of the best zoos in the us.
That's really bad_comma_ but really good that your faced didn't turn out scarred for life. 
True. It is quite terrible to have acne. Mine is so bad that I can't even see.
That's so nice of them. Was it your birthday?
I'm glad you had such a fun time.
awww thats good news!
im sure the pupper was happy!
That's awesome! I hope you get the good news soon.
Early congratulations to ya!
thats awesome _comma_ and happy birthday !!!
what kind of gifts did you get ?
That's really good for you. What kind of job do you have?
That sounds like a really neat job. Are you going to get a promotion soon?
That's great! Good for him!
That will be exciting!
lol.  Maybe you should talk to them about it!
Yeah I understand.  Maybe you should pay them back by interrrupting them?
That's too bad. Do you have a new job lined up?
I hope you find one soon. If you don't_comma_ you are more than welcome to come work in my sweatshop in Siberia.
Oh that must be such a relief.
Did the little guy even feel guilty for running away?
You cannot enjoy bowling all alone. It is a group game. Don't you have any friends to invite?
What happened? Is it something because of you or him?
I have a Chase credit card. They really aren't that great_comma_ but I do hope you get approved. Why do you need it?
That sounds like a smart plan. When do you find out?
that is such a sweet story.. congrats to both of you
it is so nice to see a marriage as strong these days!
That sounds awesome. I didn't know such places existed.
Do they serve coffee? Like starbucks?
oh i see.. how did you do?
way to go! as you know_comma_ hard work always pays off
Oh no!  I bet it smelled bad.  Did you clean it up?
LOL it's been on the carpet for a few weeks???  Clean it up already.  She won't do it
That's really swell! What lake did you go to?
I am happy that you had a great weekend. I should really check it out myself sometime.
Wow. It can be difficult to put together but finding the parts is a lot of fun.
I think if you show that you put in some effort yourself first she won't mind.
Wow. You were either very imaginative or upset.
Thought that reminded me of Death Note_comma_ but I think L only focused on criminals.
That's kinda bad. What did you lie about?
Well_comma_ I suppose it is justified as long as you don't do it all the time.
Thats good. Where did they find it?
Is that how much doritos and a mountain dew costs there. geez
thats the same thing happening at my job _comma_ super lazy worker just walks around and hides in the restroom its annoying
yes it does_comma_ i wish people like that would just get fired 
That is horrible. Did you find out who did it?
I think you should have put them in a difficult to reach for babies place
Oh no_comma_ did you go on time? 
Just leave it. Try to be punctual here after.
I love flowers_comma_ that's great!
Wow_comma_ that is some fast growth.
i have heard good things about that show.  are you a fan?
is it going to be the last season? that's too bad.
That sounds very nostalgic.
Love was so innocent back then.
Oh geez_comma_ that is certainly cause for alarm. Did you summon the stoop kid?
Ah_comma_ there is your problem right there. 99.9% of the time a stoop kid will chase away nasty pigeons_comma_ no problem.
I never took the ACT
I meant SAT. I took the ACT. how did you do in the end?
Is that not funny? I think its hilarious
Interesting. What lead to that?
Were you guys close when you were younger?
Man it's so much fun to just have a good conversation with people. 
That's no good. Why are you upset with them?
I would be equally as angry. I think I would've put them up for adoption.
Why put ramen in the fridge?
How are you  doing in college? because that is ridiculous lol
Awwww yeah! ...what exactly is on?
Yeah! Come on over here and we'll throw a regular ole pizza party!
Can they not afford ramen?
I'd vote you class president!
corn dogs are yummy. where do you get yours from?
ew. that sounds bad. but if it was free_comma_ i guess that's a good thing.
That's no good. Why did you feel like that?
Oh no. Who was at the door? Was it a mime?
Oh no_comma_ I hope you pardon them. 
This is too much of punishment for kids.
Oh that really cool.. I bet it was really complicated_comma_ huh?
It is always awesome to see a genius at work. a glimpse into their passion
Oh no.. I hope you was not hurt
I can understand that. Dont feel bad_comma_ it happens to the best of us buddy :)
Oh no! did you file a police report?

Oh yeah? I've been looking for a new show to watch. Which one is it?
Dang! I should start watching it. I love Stephen King.
Shame on you! What did you buy?
You should have bought ramen lol
That's great! Are you going to be in the wedding?
That's too bad. When is the wedding?

So sad to hear that.. i am so sorry about that buddy. hope you feel better
haha_comma_ foids am i right?
yep_comma_ hypergamy is a real killer
That's always so annoying_comma_ especially when they overeat and waste food.
My cat does that all the time so I feel you.
Sounds awesome! We have a fitness center locally that offers tanning beds and massages.  i was thinking of joining just for that.
I wish you luck and make sure to stay hydrated.
That's awesome! I love hearing stories like that.
Hopefully the pizza is just like you remember!
Sometimes it is nice to look back.
Yes_comma_ I would say it is bittersweet.

brown eyes arent bad
I would have kept it!
I'm sure you were_comma_ money is good to have.
Well done_comma_ you studied for it and passed!
Thanks amazing! I know you have a bright future ahead of you
Oh no_comma_ who was it?
Aw no_comma_ I have a cat and I really don't like thinking about him dying. Sorry to hear that.
Why did you get a ticket then if it was for no reason?
That's absurd!  Too bad there arent any cameras around to prove your innocence!
You don't like roller coasters?
I think they are tons of fun!
That is a very good wish to have buddy
true. in other words you want to make them financially stable
I never leave my house! Much less play sports!
I love it inside where the AC is!
So you and your dad didn't have a great relationship? Or did you mean to say hat?
Aw well at least you have that to eternalize him.

oh.. why did you do that?
Did you tell him and pay him back?
thats quite nice
thats super awesome
I never even carry a wallet any more!
I just use the back of my phone_comma_ which holds my cards.
I know_comma_ they have so much talent too!
Unfortunately_comma_  I have gotten used to it.
What did you do about it?
I would not have done that_comma_ did he hit you?
What are you saying? 
I can't believe this! are you serious?
What type of project is it?
I do all of my business digital.
That makes sense_comma_ since your feet are likely gonna smell too.
I guess just take a spare pair with you!
I could not even imagine how you would have felt.
I do not like to be sad.
I sure hope so.  It is making me a little blue.
Yes I agree.  I have flowers and they need sun and rain.
I have already done that and it is usually so depressing.
It's good to get everything you need but I hate school in general.
I understand that completly_comma_ i also do not have a car.
One day you will own many cars.
Oh wow that's lucky! So they are paying for everything?
Hopefully you get there then so that you can repay them!
That is truly magical.
I would never ever cheat on anything!
wth thats crazy
you should john wick them
I keep my money in the bank_comma_ never in a wallet!
I understand_comma_ you have to go and get another one.
Do you?  Me too!  Which one is your favorite?
Oh.  I thought you said "like" at first.  I'm sorry.  I like them!  You should try watching more of them!
I have never been_comma_ but i would be very unhappy about it.
I would be careful_comma_ it might break any time!
That's good to hear! What kind of car is it?
What brand of car is it then?
I think in person would have been better!
Sometimes things are much better face to face.
I do not drive at all_comma_ i stay home.
Stay indoors and no need for that!
Oh yes_comma_ I love taco Tuesday!
That must be a proud tradition. 
NIce! Where are you goin?
That sounds fancy. I like Texas_comma_ never been there though.
I dislike football_comma_ very much.
I'm sure he will do great things for you.
Aw!  How come?  
lol what does that mean?  You should find a good hobby! 
That's great! How much did they win?
That's good.  I bet he was happy.
Oh that's exciting! Have you gone before?
That's true_comma_ the experience is different when you're older.
Trips are very expensive to go on.
Food is so expensive these days.
So sweet_comma_ It's good to have pets with us.
Have a happy life with your pets and enjoy with them.
I only like american food!
Food is the gateway to the soul.
i am sorry to hear that. i hope it wasnt a bad break.
wow_comma_ that is a slap in the face.
Oh wow that's really exciting! You must be really happy.
That's great to hear_comma_ I hope his first day goes well!
oh that sucks_comma_ i guess you called in to make up a lie and make up the quiz
cool_comma__comma_ thats great
That's good to hear. What subject was this in?
Math is the worst sometimes_comma_ especially when you see the test and panic since you know nothing.
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Was anyone hurt?
I know it's hard to lose your stuff_comma_ but it can be replaced.  At least you are ok.
Oh no! Did they reimburse you?
I'm sure it is.  I would be furious!
Wow_comma_ congrats on my behalf.
It's lovely. Be a happy couple. live long together!
Oh no!  Did you call the police?
Was it an accident? or on purpose?
Why were you surprised? Is he shy?
Some girls like a certain type. Or maybe it was written in the stars.
That's so sweet!  I bet he is an awesome dad!
This is true.  Did you have some good memorable times together?
Thats good.  I'm glad to hear that.
Oh cool! Where are you gonna do that?
Oh yeah they are safe 99% of the time
Aw I'm sorry. Can you retake the class?
i understand. Those classes are expensive too.
How cool! What did you think of it?
Wow_comma_ hopefully next time it may taste better!
That's a wonderful thing to hear!  Did you get through college?
I bet they are!  You should take them out to dinner to celebrate!
You're welcome and congrats on graduating!  That's such a great accomplishment!
Nice! Where are you going?
That should be a good trip for you.  Ever been there?
What do you mean by that?
Wow that is absolutely tragic to hear. That's so cruel of them.
Wow really?
I hope you guys were alright?
Oh really? Why's that?
Oh cool_comma_ I'm doing that too in a few days!
5
Oops.  I didn't mean to type 5 LOL.  I hope you get to take breaks to go see your cat on the weekends :(
did you watch them with someone special?
aw that's sweet.  I'm sure they loved it more than you know.
Oh really? Does it make you anxious?
That's a bad outlook_comma_ you should stay positive!
Oh no. What grade did you get?
Thats great I happy for you. Its a positive step.
Why's that? Something important?
Oh wow that's exciting! I'm happy for you.
Aww.  How do you feel about that?
Yeah I bet.  Hey at least you're out there trying.  That's all you can really do.
Me too! I like to win_comma_ I guess that makes me competitive.
It is a good thing_comma_ it gives you an edge.
Oh yea? when is the trip?
I bet you are going with a loved one that's why you are so anxious about the trip
oh yea did you do a good job to get one?
thats great nice job
Why what happened? Hopefully nothing bad.
Don't worry_comma_ I'm sure you did fine.
I know what you mean_comma_ that has happened to me before and it is an awful feeling.
It probably isn't_comma_ I really hope it isn't too.
Sorry to hear that. What did your friends say?
Hopefully your friends make it up to you!
Yeah isn't that awesome!  What kind of dog do you have?
Aww that's so cute!  Does he do any tricks?
hehe how adorable!  Give him kisses for me!
What is your test about?
Oh nice_comma_ I worked at a pharmacy while I was in high school and I loved it. I thought about getting that certification. Is it hard?
wow_comma_ that is such a special occasion!what a gift
because you witnessed it.
Oh that's exciting! Are you gonna propose or what?
That sounds so nice_comma_ I wish I had a long term relationship like that!
Oh thats good 
It's always a good thing to turn things around
Was a happy shocked feeling or a bad one?
Thats great. where was the trip to and who with?
oh really why is that?
oh dang thats a real thinker
I know that feeling. I get it when I feel anxious.
Have you tried yoga and meditation? It can help.
Oh no_comma_ so sorry. Was your son okay?
Thats so unfortunate. I hope he learnt he's lesson. On the brighter side is that your son is okay.
why is that?
sounds super fun
Oh that's awesome!  Where you going?
Cool!  I've never been there.  Are you excited to go?
That sounds terrible. I would expect nothing less for a presumably high cost hotel. 
That's good but should also be standard for any hotel_comma_ nevertheless a 5 star one. How was the new room?
You must have been rather disappointed. But its the thought that counts.
True_comma_ they only want the best for us. Sometimes that can mean making hard decisions_comma_ such as foregoing the bike.
Oh cool! What job does she work?
That's really nice! Glad to hear that she is moving up the ladder!
if it's someone you know you should ask them not to do it again
oh thats bad!
I bet they will.  That's the way to look at things.  With some optimism!
Yeah.  Well I wish you luck my friend.  Keep your head up!
Ohh thats nice. May I ask what for?
What an amazing women. She must be very strong.
I'm not one to judge. We all have done things we regret in the past. Why did you do it though?
Well I guess you learnt a valuable lesson_comma_ just don't do it again.
yea i know what you mean
yea it sucks to think it might fail
Wow_comma_ that's really nice of your father! What type of car did he get you?
That's nice that you can depend on your father.
Oh my_comma_ what movie was it?!
You must have had trouble sleeping that night!
Sounds like trouble. What did he do?
Thanks that was very helpful.
so sad
it is alright
I'm glad that I don't have to deal with any of that for a few more weeks of summer vacation.
Well I hope that you do well on that exam!
wow i can relate_comma_ feels goof knowing you will do well so you can not worry about it
yea exactly
nice
really?
i bet .that is always a tough situation.

Congratulations! It must be exciting to live on your own!
It's nice to have company and make close friends during college.
Oh that's always nice. What made you feel that?
Aw that's funny_comma_ I always love those kinds of heartwarming moments.
I can imagine it can be stressful!
Yes_comma_ and fortunately you will have many more!
awww how cool. what was it?
that sounds very cool!
Aw that's annoying when my cat does that too.
Especially when they seem to do it in the worst place possible.
yea i know what you mean_comma_ austin should share
yea exactly
Thats awesome. B is great and you'll smash it next time.
I guess to keep on trying and don't be so hard on yourself_comma_ a B grade is good enough too.
Give me an example of something that happened then.
I know what you mean_comma_ I'm really really shy too.
Sometimes it just gets a little overwhelming. There can just be too much going on at once_comma_ especially if you have more than one child.
You just have to do what is best for you and your family. One day your kids will understand_comma_ especially when they have kids of their own and have so many other things going on.
that is a very good achievement to hear
what do you do for you to become the best employee?
That is true
Medics are life savers_comma_ so you must trust them with your life
Which class was that? I'm glad to hear that.
I'm about to go into that same class so I hope I do well too.
yea i loved doing that all summer
same_comma_ its quite cool
That's great! What job did you get?
That's the same kind of job that I'm looking to get_comma_ so that's awesome!
You need to wipe away the guilt and seek forgiveness for yourself.
Yes stealing is a bad act_comma_ but now you have learned your lesson!
Oh no! What had happened to you?
That's a tough situation. I hope you are able to make the best move for you.
me too I love them and I am very excited as well
I know they'll make so much money from it within the first week of release
i know what you mean i wish i had either
yea i know_comma_ my friend max has that too and i would like a girlfriend but its tough
That's so painful. I hope it didn't hurt for too long.
I know what you mean_comma_ it can linger sometimes.
i know how you feel
thats an unhealthy way to think but its hard to avoid
Thats not nice for you. Did you try meeting people?
I know exactly how you feel as I'm one too. Keep at it though as deep within us_comma_ theres a great spirit there.
did you enjoy it?
what was the movie about?
It's excellent. My hearty congrats to you!
have a excellent career ahead to you!! 
I agree_comma_ nothing like seeing them smile and have fun!
Yup. Enjoy it whilst they're young! 
That's great_comma_ I don't pray often because I'm not too religious...
Yes_comma_ count your blessings because there are people who do not have it as good as you
Did you start to feel a bit lonely?
That's tough_comma_ but it helps you learn what you like to do on your own.
Stolen? That's horrible!
I really hope so too_comma_ whoever did it is an awful person.
That's precious. How old are they?
They are really starting to grow up_comma_ you better cherish them while you can.
Sorry dude_comma_ thats rough. Do you know why she did that?
Women. Keep strong dude_comma_ theres someone out there for you.
oh yea i know what you mean
it really does feel bad tho
It's important to spend time with your friends while you can!
Make some good memories and enjoy these next few weeks.
Great_comma_ I bet he did a good job 
I know_comma_ it's probably because you are related 
I agree_comma_ people who do animal cruelty should be in jail.
Yes_comma_ we need to start teaching about this from a young age in schools.
wow_comma_ really_comma_ what was the result?
really_comma_ that is excellent_comma_ you are a genius
Oh no that's too bad_comma_ it wasn't your fault at least.
Yeah_comma_ just make sure that you aren't in too much of a rush like that.
Really? Congrats 
That's a cool ride
That is nice. Did she like it?
That is great.
Don't upset for her. May be she isn't worth for your love.
Yeah_comma_ I can understand your feelings for her.
Oh really? Why do you think that is?
Aw I know that feeling since I had a big brother.
yea i know how you feel
yea i hate clowns too
Sorry to hear that. That must have been lonely.
Hopefully you can make new friends and explore new places with them!
did you return it?
did the get mad at you?
Oh my_comma_ were you rushed to the hospital?
I can see why. Are you alright now?
really? what happened afterwards?
I hope you didn't hurt yourself
Me too. Its always fun during Christmas 
That is true
Don't feel bad for the opportunity that you have. Life is not set out on an even keel so we all must make the best of our lot.
I'm happy that you have this opportunity in life. Keep at it and be thankful for it.
Same_comma_ I can never go into public bathrooms for this exact reason. It is amazing how bad it smells in one of those!
Yeah_comma_ pretty much all humans would rather smell good things than bad lol. I hope you can get over this phobia though as I know how it feels to just despise something.
that is a slap in the face.
it happens to the best of us
What job did you apply to then?
I'm sure you'll get the job_comma_ buddy!
So exciting! What did you do with that money?
Thats good! I would have just spent it on drinks!
Really! That must have bee so frustrating for you.
jealous? Not sure why your jealous of somebody being inconsiderate.
You always hope that is the case. Sounds like it didn't turn out well. I'm sorry.
That's terrible and really not fair to you. I feel so bad you had to go through that. 
Well good luck and I'm sure you will.
Your very confident. I guess thats a good attitude to have.
I wish I was more like that.
You must be prepared for anything then.
oh really? that must sting
yea i can see why you would be
You must have been disappointed. Did you ask why you didnt get it?
I would be too. But there will be plenty of other opportunities! 
Why are you nervous?
Really?
yea i agree with that
yea its not mucht ho
You must have been disappointed in that! Was it an important class?
You will_comma_ you need to keep at it!
That's so inspiring! How did he do that?
Oh wow_comma_ what a claim to fame! 
I know what you mean_comma_ it's the excitement that keeps you up!
I would always try to sneak a peak of the gifts when my parents were not looking.
I know right. Did your Mum ask you to see if you wanted it also?
Oh no. I'm sorry. Families can be tough.
Why?
That is true?
To whom did you give instructions? 
Did you feel powerful giving instructions? 
Excellent_comma_ you must feel proud of him as well!
As you should be! It takes a lot of hard work.
Did you talk to her?
It is nice that both of you still share good memories.
I hate it when that happens. Where you doing anything important when it happened?
Making money doing what? I hope you got it all sorted out though.
thats great you should feel proud
thats pretty sweet
Well done to you. Not everyone has that type of focus. What where you studying for?
Thats great. Did you ace the test?
have you had a lot of bad experiences?
i do agree with you there.
oh my_comma_ I hope you were alright?
I'm glad you are alright!
Financing can be scary but a lot of places now have really great rates for auto loans.
That sounds like a plan. It make take a while though to save that much so just be patient.
I am not a fan either
I definitely agree
Sorry for that. I hate last minute cancellations. Did he have a good reason?
Who needs friends like that. So what did you do? 
Why?
I understand. I have the feeling. Most people are now looking only for their interests.
Thats great isn't it. I hate it when managers just boss you around and never listen. 
I'm happy for you that this new manager is better. It just makes working a whole lot better and more enjoyable.
I like secrets. Did it turn out the way that you hoped it would.
It was nice that you had him to turn to for help.
You must have been rather surprised. Did you thank her for it?
What a nice person. You should throw a party for her! 
What are you studying
That does sound nice
You must have worked hard for it! You deserve it then.
Good. Hopefully you continue to prepare well for the future challenges.
Sorry to hear that. That is bad. What your manager did say about it?
That is ok if they understood the situation. It will be fine.
wow what a horrible thing to walk into!
I hope it was fixed that day
Any good emotions
Those are nice feelings to have
Oh my_comma_ why was she arrested?
You shouldnt feel ashamed of your moms action. It was not your fault.
Sounds like you may be choosing the same kind of person each time. There are good ones. If you give up now you may lose the chance to find the person who is right for you.
I know it's hard. Just don't give up. 
I understand how you feel
I bet you will be able to mend the fences after this meeting
Did you enjoy it?
That is great to have fun.
That is so sad
That might be true
You must have thanked him for it! What was the present?
That is so helpful. I wish my brother would get me such presents.
What kind of emotions
I can understand
I miss those times too
I am confused by that as well
I would had the same reaction. Why did they fire you?
I understand. I hope you will find a better job.
I bet that was a nice feeling
I am happy for you
Was it good>
sounds like a good weekend!
What could go wrong when you're taking an exam?
I understand that but I think you will be fine! We all get that fear when it comes to an important test_comma_ it means we're human and still feel things!
Ugh dentist visits are the worst. Atleast you can look forward to taking a break from work.
Oh yes_comma_ but sometimes my boss let me off when I have to go to the dentist!
That's quite an investment. It must have made you feel good to be buying it with your own money.
That was really nice of you. I'm sure that he appreciated it.
Is it related to your passion?
Yeah_comma_ move on till you reach your dream job.
Oh so what did he speak about?
That is a very important topic to know about. I always try to save money where I can.
That is gross
I am sorry that happened
That sounds scary
I am glad you did
Oh my_comma_ sorry to hear that. Hopefully_comma_ you have a lot of good memories of her.
Yes it is important to remember her like that.
I am sorrry_comma_ was he okay?
I can understand that
That is good to hear! he must have worked hard for it.
He must have. Otherwise he would not have got that promotion! 
That is terrible. What did you do?
How is your dog?
Sometimes that happens_comma_ maybe you lost focus during?
Don
Did that make you proud
I am glad you feel that way
why did you lie to her?
Say sorry to her and develop your love!!
Cool. You should look totally different?
That is nice.
That does not sound good. You should speak to the police about this.
You have to do something or they wont stop and you will live in fear!
Were you able to catch up with them on what's been going on in both your lives?
It's always nice to catch up with old friends!
That sounds stressful
I am glad you made it out okay
Is everything alright? Do they know what's wrong?
I'm really sorry_comma_ can you try to spend as much time with him as you can now? I'm sure he would appreciate having his loving family nearby.
You must be really anticipating that move! What makes you think that?
Thats sounds cute. I hope he does and you go on a day trip to ski! 
Really?
Will you hang out with them?
I am sorry that happened
It will get better
That is bad. Did she notice?
I would have the same feeling. You just need to forget about it.
Good job! Did you inform the police about this?
Ha! I agree. its good that you took matters into your own hands.
Really?
Did you?
What is transparent_comma_ may I ask?
Thats good. Hopefully there was not any rigging!
Did you end up having nightmares?
that's happened to me before! it is not fun
Oh my_comma_ that must have been terrifying. Is it gone now?
Neither do I. Imagine if it came into your house!
Wow_comma_ hope you had a blast and great time!
good. Hope you'll have another surprise party.
Where are you going
It will be fun
That's good news did you already take the written portion
that's great news
What was it
That sounds great
That is rude of him. But I am sure he must have had a reason to do so.
I see_comma_ does he cancel very often?
That is good. Do you feel grateful now that you feel relaxed?
You should. You will feel energized when you wake up.
That sounds so awesome. I bet you worked hard. 
I understand that but now it’s all over right?
That is a surprise where ou nervous to open it?
I wouldve been too no one really writes anymore like back in the day
Same here_comma_ I know how you feel buddy
I get it every morning with some crackers :)
How can you not be what?
That's very intense I hope you called the police.
That is nice. What did you do during the weekend?
It is always good to hang out with friends.
That sounds horrible
They are sometimes
really?  that must have been a desperate time for you
we've all had times in our life that we were not proud of
Talk about annoying! Companies need to hire more people so we aren't sitting around on hold!
Did they have an online chat option?
Oh I am sorry to hear that... do you have plans on trying again?
Yes unfortunately it is... Last time I went_comma_ it rained most of the day
That sounds like a great time. 
It is nice that you still have those 
are you happy about that?
that sounds good! I rather work earlier and leave earlier
So you have to do the whole process with the passport over again??
I would ask the people in charge who lost my paperwork? And tell them to go find the paperwork! 
I feel sorry for you. Did you get another job?
Good. Hope you've an wonderful career ahead!
That was nice of you
I am glad he did well
That is nice. Is she better?
Good. She will have more trust in you now.
He is smart to be that rich
That is true
thats awesome_comma_a boy or girl?
Great! I have 3 boys.  3 2 and 6 months haha
400 plasma?
Oh really?
lol. That's no problem
That is tough. That is so nice of you to be there for them
Sounds like you are a really great friend
What are you guys going to do
He sounds cool
It is always good to have things prepared in advance so you can get them done quick and easy.
I hate having to get everything ready at the last minute. It seems to hectic and chaotic when you do things that way.
I am sorry_comma_ it happens though
I am sure she will forgive you
Did she give you a reason why?
I'm sorry but maybe something came up for her that's a little personal?
Did he all get A's?
I would be proud too. That takes a lot of effort to get straight A's.
How did it go
I am happy for you
Oh was it a nice house?
That's good for them then.  I hope you get to buy a new home too.
Oh no! That's not good! What's going on?
That's not a good environment to be in. Maybe you can find something else quickly.
Congratulations! I am sure you deserve it.
You will climb high in the company with that good attitude.
Why are you nervous?  Just try to be confident
Change your way of thinking.  Maybe you are out of her league!
I am sorry you were mad
It will get better
Did he come to pick you up?
That is great to have someone that you can trust.
That's a good thing. A lot of people usually have to work on their weekends off instead of relaxing.
What did you do to relax during the weekend?
Oh my lord_comma_  how long to you think it had been there
Thats not good_comma_  was he all smashed up?
That sounds scary
I am glad you were okay
Hahahaha funny though. Did he have something to do with it?
Ohhhh that's not fair
What happened? did someone scare you?
That is no good_comma_ But maybe he deserved it.
Are you excited for it?
Wow you are really speeding things up there_comma_ aren't you?
WHAT? did_comma_ you have any idea beforehand_comma_  or he just showed up with your idea.
OH no! I didnt even think about that.  That must have been terrible.
Really?
Ok
Oh no_comma_  How long did he live?  is he still alive?
Thats not very long_comma_ I am sorry for your loss.
Why were you late getting to work?
Your boss should really understand things like that happen and not yell at you.
It's always great to reconnect. Sounds like it was lots of fun.
You should make plans to do it again soon.
Sounds like she did well
That sounds great
What kind of surgery
I am sure you will be okay
Why you didn't go with her?
That is bad. You should had planned your vacation together.
They say for the prepared there is no such things as a surprise test.
So how did you do on the test?
That's good to have a brother like that. Most don't seem to get along.
That's good. Myself and my sister have gotten closer as we got older.
Taxes are always tough
I am there now
That is nice. Where are you going kayaking?
Have fun.
That was nice of her ha
That does sound stressful
I would have been too we get them bad here. Are you in the south? 
Same here_comma_ prepping for hurricane season. Stay safe! 
That's such a cowardly thing to do. Was there much damage?
It could have been worse. 
Me too_comma_  is there anything in particular you appreciate the most?
That's definitely a plus for us.
Nice! Was it something you were needing?
Was it for your birthday or a random gift? Wish I could receive random gifts
Congratulations_comma_ thats awesome
I do play basketball sometimes
What did you do
Oh well_comma_ its over now
being sick sucks they shoulda came over atleast to bring you a goody bag 
right tell them so next time they do! 
LOL.....doesn't sound storm prep to me.
It wasn't a Hurricane Party was it?
I hate spiders too
That sounds stressful
Did you get it done
Thats a good start
You were prepared for sure. Did you get the grades yet? 
thats good! im happy for you! 
That sounds wonderful!  What are your plans?
That's great news!  You must be so happy! Congratulations!
Don't worry. Why do you think it will cost higher?
Oh_comma_ hope it will be less cost. 
That's a good choice.  What makes you want to join?
That's as good as any reason.  When will you sign up?
We never are prepared for something like that.. how long ago was it? 
I understand! Its been about the same for me since my parents passed and it doesnt hurt any less.  Im sorry but I can tell you are strong! 
I believe that_comma_ how did it happen?
That is scary_comma_ it is not even your fault at all either
That is so gross. I hope you told the manager and got a refund.
Yeah_comma_ I would have said the same things. Aren't they supposed to wear hair nets anyway? Thats's not acceptable.
Wow that is a nice surprise! You must have done very ywell.
What kind of car did you get?
Did you call the cops on them?
That is smart_comma_ I think that is the best bet
unexpected is even better than expected! congrats! 
my god i would be too pop the bubbly! 
Oh man_comma_ I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm sure as time goes on it will become less and less.
I can only imagine.
I hate to hear that_comma_ did you have many memories of playing in those woods?
Well_comma_ it would have upset me as well. 
That is awesome! wow congrats to you! What kinda car? 
Really good on gas and small which is good for a first car. good for you nice of them! 
What did he lie about?
How old is he?
I love horse back riding.  Have you done it before or is this your first time?
My first time I sang the song from the movie Oklahoma called Oh_comma_ What a Beautiful Mornin'.  I'm kind of dorky though.
That's sad_comma_ did they say why?
How long have you been married?
Oh_comma_ It's excellent. 
Hope you'll have one soon.
Sounds like you are blissfully happy. That's a great feeling.
Don't let negativity creep in. Enjoy the moment.
What show is it?
Ah_comma_ I have heard they are brutal with the killings in that show
I'm so sorry! Is everything ok?
Are you sick or just not feeling well?
No
Really? Why did they give her a car?
Thats the worst when you do something for someone and they dont even appear to care! 
Same! Two wrongs never make a right.  You are doing the right thing. 
That's really cool_comma_ do you still keep in contact with them?
Yeah for sure_comma_ i hardly speak with any of my highschool friends either.
Oh sorry to hear that.. Don't you like florida?
Thats true.. But why don't you give it a chance? may be you will end up liking it
So sorry to hear that buddy.. where were you planning to go?
Yeah_comma_ i can sense how you feel.. It is ok buddy_comma_ you will make it there soon enough
Oh no.. why would they do that
I understand that buddy.. Cheer up_comma_ something better will come along soon enough
That is a great accomplishment!  You must be very proud!  Congratulations!
Your family is most likely just as proud!
awesome! extra money is always welcome right! Any special plans with it? 
so sweet of you and sounds like a lot of fun enjoy! 
I completely understand your point_comma_ even i get emotional about my family
And we should.. family comes above all_comma_ right?
That's true.. It is challenging. how old are you?
It is natural to feel that way in early 20's_comma_ trust me. you will adapt with time though :)
What happened to it?
That is not good_comma_ did you complain?
How old are you now?
Hmm.. Don't worry about it. You'll get the hang of adulting soon enough.
Yeah_comma_ i hear you.. I can see how that can invoke envy.. you'll get there soon
You won't be_comma_ i assure you. Do your part and hope for the best. :)
I have seen previews for it. Looks exciting. 
You aren't going to be able to sleep thinking about it.
What did you eat?
Was it expensive?
Good for you.  Feels nice having school supplies squared away in advance.
You're excited for them to start back then?
Did you speak to him about it?
I would call the cops then!
Let me guess_comma_ they are trying to overcharge you?
Wow!  That is a welcome surprise!
Are you ok?
of course. I hope everything goes better for you
You must be excited and proud all at the same time.
Is this something that he really enjoys?
I have not been a fan the last few years but I am happy for you atleast! :) lol Any special tradition? 
Well I mean when it sounds like that much fun then its a deal and  I think you are right. 
Is it something that you can go back and have added on?
Look on the bright side_comma_ you have a new truck. That has to be really cool.
Uhoh that sounds terrible.  Have they told you how long you might have to wait for?  That's no fun having to wait to hear news like that.
Yeah it's one of those situations where you would almost rather hear the news even if it was bad.  At least then you could start taking steps to combat it.
That's awesome!  What is it?
Ohh_comma_ fancy.  Well_comma_ I hope it works out well for you! :)
Sounds like fun but not for me! Im too scared of everything. Did you have fun tho? 
well you are more brave than me! 
That sounds exciting! What sort of plans do you have for it?
That sounds really exciting and like it will be a hit!
What kind is it?
Sounds like a sweer ride
Well_comma_ now you'll have some good television to watch.
That will be a nice way to get some private time.
Ugh_comma_ I would have been so annoyed.
I would have wanted to scream.  DId you have any time to drive through Starbucks or anything?
So annoying!  I need my coffee in the morning to function.
Did you get a little baby crazy?
My sister is actually pregnant right now but_comma_ I'm not supposed to know about that yet.
I'm excited. She's been trying for a couple of years.
That sucks.  I hope it wasn't a super important secret at least.
Well_comma_ hopefully your friendship won't suffer for it :)
nothing wrong with that it sounds sweet and caring of you! How many do you have? 
So sweet! I am happy you have such a close connection with them ! 
How big of an advance was it?
Awesome_comma_ that is great_comma_ congratulations!
That's great. Are you going to propose?
Well_comma_ don't rush it. You will be fine
For what?
Why is that?
I am too_comma_ but you know how Nintendo let's down it's customers sometimes.
Yeah_comma_ I mean Mario Odyssey was amazing_comma_ so with any luck Smash Brothers will follow in that pattern.
Im sorry! Why did you do that?
dang that stinks. I bet that was a fun time for you
That sounds like it can be exhausting
Maybe it's fulfills a strong urge to just buy something.
Is there any good reason for that ie; he has really low self esteem?
That sucks.  I understand why you feel that way.
omg so amazing! beautiful! Im happy for you both. :) How far along is she? 
Ughhh its so hard to keep good secrets tho honestly! 
I agree with you! What are you into watching right now?
I've been looking forward to get some time to sit down and watch it_comma_ I can't wait!
You are so right. I dont get it
ITs weird that mens bathroom are sometimes cleaner. 
What did he win?
That's terrible.
Where they too loud?
usually people who work weekends. It's pretty rude they were so inconsiderate. 
I'll keep my fingers crossed for you! 
That sounds like a lot of fun! Did you have a good time?
That's great to hear. The county fair is always a nice opportunity to spend time out with family.
They can be difficult.  What is the issue?
My kids eat all my snacks too.  Parent struggles are real.
Yes it was! I loved collecting the cards. They have pokemon go now 
 I liked it too it was fun to get out and get walking. 
Did you let her?
I get that_comma_ swimming can be dangerous for kids
Are they older or younger?
I can understand why they mean so much to you!
What did you say to them?
I get that I guess_comma_ but that is life sometimes
Thats awesome!!! you will save a lot of money for sure. 
Yup thats how it is sure a car payment is expensive but it pretty much saves you money in the long haul and looks a lot nicer! 
i know how that feels
once you get it over with you will feel better
I don't blame you. It removes your sense of security and change can always bring out fear.
One day you will be comfortable where your new home and not want to leave there either_comma_ it will only take some time.
Well_comma_ water's water_comma_ so it should work out ok.
Oh.  Dang.  Well_comma_ I guess I was wrong then :P
I haven't been to a fair in so long.
That's cool. Did you meet some cool people.
Mine started last week.
I kinda miss them_comma_ and our schedule gets a lot busier when schools in.
do you own a harley ?
its not literally your day off because you are here working talking to me lol
You may want to think about not letting her borrow it anymore.  Sounds pretty rude to me.
Maybe ask her to set the time when she can return it so you have a better idea when to expect it back.
What did you call for?
Im sorry about that
What's wrong with your brakes
You can always stop at a shop and have someone check it out
Are you sure you didn't get an offer but they are running behind?
I'm sorry_comma_ I'm sure you will find something soon.
Ouch_comma_ that could be bad.  What was her reason?
That's a tough thing to watch happen.  Just be there to support her when she needs it.
do you guys still work there ?
such an accomplishment
Well that's sweet. I bet they love you
How many  do you have?
You should take a vacation! That always helps me clear my mind.
Oh man_comma_ that is rough. I'm really sorry to hear that. Hang in there!
They did.  I've struggled with trying to be more social_comma_ I think it makes life more fun.
It really is.  Wonder how we can go about changing things.
Oh wow! Thats awesome. What type of car?
Oh sweet! well congrats
That can be dangerous.
I hope no one gets hurt
i could agree with this
same here but mostly at xmas time
That is awesome. What do you do?
That is great_comma_ I am so happy for you
For a party?
I hate when that happens. I hope you complained and got a refund
I love DR. Pepper. It's just so hard for me to keep the weight down if I continue to drink it.
I try to keep it in moderation now but even that is hard. It's so addicting.
I remember playing that on the wii
Will it be available on xbox?
How is that feeling today?
That is okay_comma_ everyone knows it is nasty anyways
time heals all pain
which is understandable
I get that_comma_ he was a very funny fellow_comma_ sad story
I did not really_comma_ so I see how you would be more attached
What did he make you?
Well_comma_ at least he tried. You have to be happy about that.
That is so true! Some woman aren't loyal
Its great you trust an awesome woman
Oh! That's great to hear. What were you fighting about?
It's normal to fight about things as a couple_comma_ but I would wait a little longer before you decide to get married :)
Cruises are fun. What is the problem?
Two weeks is a long time.
I wouldnt risk it
How was it?
That's pretty mean... jeez
I'm gonna tell on you.
well_comma_ that's not nice at all.
you can confront them about it.
No!!! I would die!!
Did you kill it??
That's nice :)  I do that with pictures of my wife.
I hear you.  The best motivation is family.
Big plans?
that's awesome!
I bet you were very nervous that day.
I am sorry to hear that
That is so true! 
Weve been together for 10 years. 
What kind of sofa is it?
That is awesome! Congratulations
That is awesome! I dont think anyone should feel ashamed of what they look like in a bathing suit. We all have imperfections!
I think we are all our own best critics and can be too hard on ourselves when it comes to appearances.
that's great to hear! I love when people help each other
oh i know. I always try to help as much as i can. i donate clothes and food
That has happened to me too. What did you do?
Aw.  A little mice won't hurt you. It's more afraid of you then you are of it.
Did it run after you?
Did you scream loudly and run?
Oh no. That had to be painful
I know how you feel. At least its not on youtube
and epically failing lol
Did she not study enough?
That's no good. What grade is she in?
Cool. Have you found a place?
Well that's nice. IS it going well?
That really stinks! Did you complain to him? 
Wow...What a bad neighbor! Maybe insurance will cover it?
That sucks.  Do you always try specific diets or do you sometimes just try to eat less?
That's the worst part_comma_ the late night hungers.
OH that's terrible. Even worse that's in baby soap?
Well you dodged one bullet.
Thats great for them! 
Yeah that can feel disappointing_comma_ and you can feel left out. Im sorry thats how it is for you. Maybe you will meet someone at their wedding?
Oh no!  That might be one of my worst fears!  Could you sleep any more after?
I've heard of it_comma_ but I can't even imagine going through it.  I'm sorry it happened to you.
That sucks.  I hate when friends move away.  Are you really good friends with them?
At least she's moving for a good reason.  I had a similar thing with a childhood friend who moved for school.
That stinks :( Why did you have to work late?
You should quit. There's nothing worse than a workplace with employees who can't carry their own weight.
I'm sorry you're having trouble :(  Is there anyone you can talk to about it?
There's never too much :)  You can always find someone online or a therapist who you haven't talked to before.
I hear you. It's been super hot and humid here for weeks. The only time i get out of the house is to go to the pool or get groceries lol
why not? the pool is nice and cool :) i just hate staying home for a long time
Is it more of verbal arguing or flat out physical fights?
Wow. What do they usually argue about? 
my family gets into politics a lot_comma_ but fortunately it rarely turns hostile.
Congratulations! Thats awesome!
I bet! I would be the same If i had a niece
That's good_comma_ stress is so common in life so it's easy to become overwhelmed.
That's an impressive philosophy_comma_ you seem to have grit so I think you will go far.
That's very nice of you. We need more compassion in the world for sure.
I understand. But my family turns a deaf ear. I'm pleased that you did not.
Oh no_comma_ were you happy about not having to work?
I suppose your right_comma_ money matters
Aw_comma_ that's nice.  Do you have a lot of good memories of high school?
My experience wasn't that great_comma_ but I still had good times back then.
it happens to everyone _comma_ i stole too
its over with_comma_ dont even worry about it
I was devastated as well_comma_ he brought joy to all
Oh wow_comma_ what was that like?
Oh_comma_ how did that go? It sounds important.
That's wonderful_comma_ it must feel good to see your preparation pay off.
What sort of meat did they have?
Sounds really tasty
Oh man. Was it body odor like he hasn't showered or something on him like smoke or animal stink?
yeah I typically can't stand the smell of BO either. There really is no excuse. Just take a shower man!
Holy moly! I hate spiders...You should spray your house more_comma_ just in case!
Hahaha! I would too_comma_ but keep some bug spray close too!
What is the square footage?
Thats a good size_comma_ good area as well?
consider yourself lucky
better that than to be drowned in studen tloan
I would be upset too! Why would they do that? did you try talking to teachers or principal?
gosh that's frustrating! I'm sorry to hear that
Anyplace near you where you can get a cup?
ok_comma_ that will do you I think at least for todayl.
Nice.  I've never had luck with being unprepared for things_comma_ I always choke.
Probably.  I'm just bad at faking it :P
That is awful! Did you break up with him?
Well I hope you can trust him again!
4? 
Aw man they are usually a lot of fun. Why are you nervous?
aww_comma_ that's so sweet of your co workers! You're definitely appreciated there
I love surprises like that! What kind of cake did they get?
How many hours a day are you training
Good For you_comma_ I am really envious of people that take the time to work on their body
ewww! that's gross. I actually made a toast for my son yesterday and when i was about to give it to him i noticed a little bit of mold on the side. i almost threw up
i bet your appetite was ruined!
How do you think the interview went?
Yes_comma_ that uncertainty is always tough to deal with.  But I hope you get the job!
What were some of your favorites?
I see_comma_ hopefully someone can fulfill his role
like what kind
dont we all
That's great! Have you been doing ok this year?
That's really rough. Im sorry. I hope everything goes well for you
Aw man. Who has been working there longer_comma_ you or the co-worker?
Did you receive any sort of feedback as to why you might have been passed over?
Boooo! Yeah. Might be worth chatting with HR to see if there are any pointers you can get so maybe next time will go in your favor.
Oh no! That's unfortunate...did you guys reconcile?
That's great to have that kind of support!
I think so.  Generally getting more or less than what you deserve to get is unbalanced.
I can understand that.  Hopefully everything works out in the end though.
Im sorry! Are you going to be ok?
I bet. It stinks that that is happening to you
Yeah that's terrible. is you cat fixed?
That might be why she does it. It's something to consider.
oh no_comma_ that's bad :( what did you lie about?
that's not good :( so i bet your wife asked you if you give him something and you said no? you should tell her
Been there myself_comma_ the anticipation can really get to you.  What kind of job is it?
Finacial analyst_comma_ sounds impressive.  Good luck_comma_ I hope you do well and get it.
COuld you explain why?
How much was in and why not return the cards and id's?
Do you miss your grandmother?
Did you get a picture of just her or does it also have you in the picture?
Any luck yet on that?
Well_comma_ I wish you luck. Maybe you need a distraction.
Could you prepare or ask for help on it?
Do your best and be confident about your work
OH NO! Is it fixable or totally destroyed?
Understandable I would be too. Did you explain to them the severity of what they did?
Oh nice_comma_ I'm sure that is quite a relief. Where are you going?
I hear it's really nice there this time of year. I hope you have a good time!
That's awesome. Have you been bowling for a long time?
Have you ever bowled a perfect game?
Congrats! How long have you been with your company?
Good job_comma_ keep on moving up!
Maybe is time for vacations?
May a change of jobs?
I'm a very apolitical person. 
not really. I'm a felon. I don't get to vote. So I have no representation. That makes me a Subject of the U.S._comma_ instead of a citizen.
That's embarassing.  What was their reaction?
Pretend with her.  Maybe it's best to act like it didn't happen.
What did they do?
Did they know that the dress you were wanting?
Aw. I'm sorry. I'd say you have reason to be upset. I probably would be too.
What happened to you?
Did you ever move out?
What happened?
Good_comma_ make sure you take your time and do your best
I havent been a county fair in ages. Did you make yourself sick eating junk food?
Of course. The rides are great. Should have at least had a funnel cake.
How long has he been playing?
so along time?
I'm really sorry to hear that. How long ago was that?
Oh wow. I didn't know about it. Are you doing alright?
That's good to hear. How long have you been married?
That's great. Do you have any children?
Oh no_comma_ did you ask  the restaurant if they have video?
Thats unfortunate_comma_ the bright side is that it wasnt stolen and the car is still in good working condition
That was rude. Did you confront them?
I suggest you just ask them why they didn't invite you straight up. No need to sugarcoat the main topic
Wow_comma_ that's pretty early!
I bet he was. Did you record it?
awww_comma_ i used to play sega with my brother :) it was awesome. streets of rage was my favorite game
oh man!!! I remember contra!! It's a shooting game right? gosh we used to play this game a lot!!
Same.  There's a lot of things I wish I could go back to for a while.
That's the bad part about time :)
Really? Maybe you should ask your boss for a raise.
Oh_comma_ well that's no good.... you deserve to be paid more for your hard work.
Uau_comma_ that was a close call indeed.
I not going to even try that_comma_ thanks
That is interesting_comma_ why do you say that?
I think a good amount of people feel the same
Yeah_comma_ I know how that goes.
Yeah_comma_ definitely. I'm always looking for ways to make more money.
They do grow up quickly don't they! But just think of all the wonderful new things he'll learn and friends he'll make. He'll be able to tell you all about it when he gets home!
That's a definite plus. You'll be able to have a little "me" time_comma_ which is also important.
That's great_comma_ on both counts. You must be so proud of them both.
Ha! I remember when my nephew was born. I visited my sister-in-law at the hospital. He's 21 now!
That sounds really annoying. Have you said anything to them about it?
Oh that's not good at all. I can't believe they just let their dog do that.
That is very nice. Did you feel better after that?
That is very good and I am glad!
Oh really_comma_ good for you!
I hope you do. Good luck!
Yeah_comma_ I hate getting stuck in traffic.
Sometimes taking the long route will get you there faster.
what???? That's terrible!! what a horrible person!
I bet! I mean you pay for gym membership_comma_ you can stay on any equipment as long as you want!
That's great! Congratulations. How much weight have you lost?
Thats fantastic. Keep it up
I agree. If you can't trust family_comma_ then who can you trust?
Oh... well I guess you can't always trust family. But at least you can trust your wife and kids!
Don't worry too much! I'm sure you'll do great.
Yeah_comma_ everything will work out. That kind of thing is totally normal.
Ugh that is so annoying. I try not to do that when I with my girlfriend.
have you talked to him about it? How much it bothers you.
That is awesome. Sounds like you studied hard!
Awesome_comma_ great job!
I'm sorry. That must make you sad.
Glad there's hope for you.
Will they be improving by alot?
Wow_comma_ that's a whole bunch right there. Congrats!
Oh jeez_comma_ did you ask him why he did that?
I see_comma_ well kids will be kids
Whoa!  I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you want to kill the guy?
Yeah I suppose I would be too.  Well_comma_ if you're marriage survived_comma_ I hope things are better now.
I bet that was a nice surprise!
Well I'm happy for you. Spend it on something nice for yourself.
Nice! That's an odd day to be paid_comma_ but good for you!
Ooooh I love bonuses. Do you have any fun plans for it?
Did you feed it lately?
Maybe he is just missing you and wants to cuddle or something.
Losing a pet is a hard thing.  Was the cat old or sick?
Did you do anything special to honor it?
That's no good! Did it stain your clothes?
Oh wow_comma_ it sounds like you were just really unlucky that night.
That sucks_comma_ did you mess up on some job activities?
Oh_comma_ maybe you should tell your boss about how noone likes him?
Did you eat something?
Toss it in the fridge or freezer. That's what I always do. Food for a rainy day :D
I bet you are super excited for it. When are you going to be together/ 
Well good for you. I didnt even know you had internet in prison! Lucky you. lol
I pray he gets well soon. I had a similar experience so I know how it feels
Great_comma_ congratulations
Congrats.You must be very proud of her.
The talent on your family is abundant.
When will you be going?
That sounds really nice.
What happened?
Was it a poisonous one?
Did everything turn out alright.
Probably for the best then.
That's great! Congratulations and well done. He must practice long and hard to get to that stage in the game.
Then its all paid off and you should both be very proud. Perhaps he'll turn pro_comma_ do you think?
Aw_comma_ well you can't win everything. Be happy for her!
Was there a prize you wanted from it? Or just recognition?
Thats a bummer! I hope you guys can plan something together once the deadline is over! 
I know :/ ...just make sure you do something fun when you have a chance! 
Did your car break down?  I always hate when unexpected things come up.
Ouch.  I bet that was uncomfortable.  
They always give a 4 hour window and either show up late or not at all
Yeah that would make me angry
I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ maybe you'll get the next one!
Maybe it won't take too long if you work really hard and make your boss happy.
What is your favorite ice cream?
Oh that is unfortunate_comma_ maybe next time
Oh no.  Did you at least get a severance? Were you able to get another job since?
Well I'm sorry to hear that.  Hopefully something good is right around the corner!
Maybe find another adult with a kid for a play date
Yeah being with other adults can help
A new school year can be a pretty exciting thing.  Is it a new school year for you or your child?
Highschool was a long time ago for me_comma_ but from what I remember I had great times.
I understand I think that's a good thing.
How long have you been married?
Time to get the spray out.
yeah_comma_ you said that.
Oh I bet.. thats always risky honestly. Did you talk on the phone to someone while walking? 
Holy! Glad you are okay. 
Oh my gosh_comma_ what did you do?
I bet_comma_ glad you are ok
oh how cool! I bet you have a very beautiful voice. was there any prize?
good job! maybe you should pursue a singing career :)
lol that's terrible. Did he do stuff like that a lot back then?
You should prank him to get him back.
Sounds fun.  What did you do there?
I have always enjoyed the fair.  Glad you got to go and have a good time.
I am sorry to hear that. Did the storage had insurance?
I understand.The emotional value is inrepleacable
I am glad you are please.  I am guessing you are a fan of Trump.
Well_comma_ she was a bit in shock that she lost I bet.  
Yes_comma_ I agree. The heat here in Texas is killing me. It was 112 last week!
Mine too_comma_ love to see the leave change colors and of course be able to wear leggings and uggs!
Oh no! Was anyone badly injured?
That's terrible. I hope your friend recovers.
What?!? That is awesome. I would be so pumped up. Were you happy for him?
Same here. Maybe he will give you some.
That was really nice of them. Sorry to hear about your mother. 
It was. Time helps.
Wow_comma_ I bet that was a blast from the past.
Sounds like it! It makes me want to go find some of my old stuff.
Why?
Oh that doesn't suprise me. I voted for Hillary_comma_ I knew Trump wasn't going to be worth anything. She probably wouldn't have been either though.
God for you.I am sure you are ready to ace that interview.
I am sure you will.
Do you think that we are going to have another 2008 all over again?
What do you think is going to be the cause of this one?
What kind of endeavor are you reffering to?
What about you? Don't you work?
Sounds like a good time.  What kind of truck is it?
My in-laws used to have an old chevy truck I don't remember the year though.
Oh wow_comma_ you bust be lucky! I only see coins haha!
Thats amazing_comma_ hope you got something yummy! 
Sounds like fun. What kind of fishing did you do? Fly fishing?
I quite fancy sea fishing - I like boats. Did you catch many fish on your trip?
That's pretty nasty. Have you confronted her about it?
That's really inconsiderate of her.
what?? that is so scary! I'm glad you are safe. that's why i always have my gun with me
it sucks that some places don't allow conceal carry! like malls and some other places and that's exactly where those shootings happen
That's great they were able to help you out. Are you doing better now?
I feel you. We were in a similar situation last year_comma_ but things have started looking up.
It is truly horrible. Such incidents mostly happen due to drivers being careless like texting while driving. I hope no deadly casualties had been involved in this event
My condolences to the family of that passed away man. It must be truly hard for them to grasp this whole sudden devastation
Good for you!!! I think its annoying when people act like that about anything.
Yes I hope he wises up some in the future!
Did you end up getting one?
Nice_comma_ where did you go?
Are you stressed out?
Try and work out or find a new hobby to take your mind off of things
Oh my_comma_ what is the matter?
I am so sorry to hear that.  What is wrong with him if I may ask?
Try and give them another call to see what the situation is
Keep positive and try and get the answer you need.
Oh! What type? A fun secret or one of those sadder ones? 
Have then be able to? May I ask what the secret is? 
Reasearching papers can be tiresome.  Did it turn out well?
Then it was worth it_comma_ even if it was arduous.
that is awful_comma_ hopefully you can plan another one soon
im sorry_comma_ thats the worst
Oh no_comma_ I am so sorry. How long do you have to wait to take it again?
I remember struggling with that too when I did my test. I was so nervous. 
Uh oh_comma_ that's bad. Did you have insurance for it?
Oh no! I hope you're able to get it fixed for cheap!
I love vacation time.  Where are you planning on going?
Sounds exciting.  I've never been there.
maybe just take it slow
maybe that was the case
What subject is it in?
Do you anticipate a problem?
That is great for you!
It is lovely to have a friend like that.
That great news.  I don't know how rare it is but in the 14 years I've been married we've seen a lot of other couples suffer with infidelity.
I find faithfulness requires love and effort.  Both together are necessary.
Agreed_comma_ it's a choice made every day.
I love to hear that_comma_ positive stuff! Im glad for you. 
I love when good things happen especially since they usually dont happen often. 
What do you mean? 
Im sorry to hear that. I think everyone feels that way to a certain degree_comma_ even if it is more for some and less for others.
I understand_comma_ that can be hard to deal with! Have you tried anything new regarding what it is that you are self conscious about?
Yuck_comma_ that would be bad.
No need to look closer at some things.
Are you planning to keep it?
That's fitting at least.
Why is that?
I understand_comma_ maybe things will improve for you!
Oh no! Are you alright?
I can't either. Hopefully they don't actually cause someone else to wreck.
Have you tried seeking expert help?
hahahahah so you are more worried about your friend than actually fixing the boat?
Oh my goodness_comma_ that's crazy! Do you have home insurance to cover the cost to replace everything?
Yeah that's awful_comma_ I'm sorry that happened to you. I'm glad you're alright at least! That's a scary thing to happen.
Oh gosh! Are you alright? 
Oh man! I'm so sorry to hear that. 
dont be nervous_comma_ your instructors will not put you in danger
i cant argue with that lol
I didn't know the exact timing like that_comma_ but it's believable and I know it's harder for the body to use the energy when you eat late.
Exactly_comma_ and since they don't burn the body turns it into fat to burn later or something like that I think.
Oh that sounds like a good deal! It wouldn't get her in trouble or anything right?
Oh okay. Thats up to you! I just wouldn't want my friend to get in trouble!
Oh yeah? When is your friend arriving?
Why are they so sad?
Hmm_comma_ yeah that is a pretty sad thing. Hopefully you can cheer them up a little.
Did you study?
That is great. I'm glad for you!
Well cool!  Were you nervous at all going into it?
So are you going to be going on a roller coaster at a fair for a second time?
Why is it so annoying? Is your friend messaging you all the time or something?
Oh_comma_ well that's not good. Do you actually owe them?
Nice! Where will you be going?
Well I really hope you two have a great time!
Don't beat yourself up about it. I did the same with my mother all the time when I was in my early teens. We've all been there.
Oh I agree_comma_ I still feel awful about it myself! But I think our parents understand and don't take it to heart_comma_ because they usually did the same thing too :)
It is a gorgeous day where I live too! I'm sorry you don't have anyone to share it with!  Do you have plans later?
I'll be relaxing in my pool later!  You shouldn't let a day go wasted just because you don't have anyone to hang with!
What happened?
Oh no!  I am sorry to hear that.  Was he suspended?
that is incredible i bet you are really proud
i remember when my daughter did her first steps i was so proud of her
Probably not.  But now I'm interested to know.  What happened?
I can believe it.  It does tend to happen.
Oh god! Did everything turn out well?
I would have been SO scared! I'm glad it all turned out fine though! 
What made you feel strange?
I am sorry_comma_ we all have our moments of wanting to go back in time_comma_ I know I do.
Oh no! I am sorry to hear that_comma_ what is going on?
That would make anyone upset! I am sorry!
That's good you're getting a break! Life is much more rough as an adult than I thought it would be as a kid.
No kidding! I'm glad things are good for you now - rest_comma_ relax_comma_ and enjoy!
Money is always amazing! Good for you. 
Go for the dark chocolate its more expensive but its worth it! 
Are you sad and all alone now?
Maybe you can find a new friend!
Oh_comma_ what a worry that must have been. Did you have to evacuate?
That must have been awful! Friends in Florida had to evacuate. When they got home their house had feet of mud in it. Did you have much damage to your property?
Oh how fun!!! I bet you had a great time!!! I LOVE county fairs!
That sounds amazing!! I love the old fashioned theme. What was your favorite thing at the fair?
Did they have a live band or was it more of a DJ type thing?
sounds super gross! i bet you were a mess. 
Thats how it usually is then boom fly guts all over your helmet and clothes. 
Where do you like to get your purses?
You sound like a smart and informed shopper.
You can use the left over money on so many other things!
Cool! That sounds like a lot of fun! I bet it will be a blast for you.
It's always great when you can afford to get what you like. Good for you! I'm sure you deserve it!
How far away is she ?
Well_comma_ that was nice .
That is a good feeling. What has changed?
That is so awesome! Congrats!
How old was your doggy?
Did she have a disease?
Oh yeah what kind of boat?
Sounds super cool im happy for you 
Oh no! I am so sorry!! I hate when something liek that happens. No one was injured?
Well_comma_ I am glad no one was injured!!! Its a shame to lose great kitchenware though!! I hope you will be able to find a suitable replacement!
Oh my gosh. You must have been horrified. I can't even imagine.
Thank goodness you are ok though. That could have been really_comma_ really bad.
That's good news.  Did they have a good track record for sales in past jobs?
Hope it all works out for you.  Selling cars can also be a stresfull job.
What!! That's awful oh my my goodness that's really pathetic 
Exactly how can you go there not being able to trust your coworkers 
NOOOO! I've been there_comma_ and I feel your pain! What kind were you trying to get?
That sounds delicious and I'm going to have to try that! My personal favorite is Ben & Jerry's Phish Food. Now I want some.
Oh_comma_ really? What happened to you?
Wow_comma_ that's pretty scary! Glad there was a good Samaritan around to warn you!
Oh my that's a big problem. What did you do?
That's good! But also was wondering what is a livid?
Oh_comma_ :D
Well good for you.  What did you do to prepare yourself?
Well good.  Did you get the job?!
Thats awesome news congrats! 
even better honestly then you didnt have to deal with the stress of trying and it just came natural! 
Is it the first day of school for them?
Summer breaks seem to be getting shorter each year.  Hope they had a good day as well.
Okay_comma_ but probably not a good idea in the long run.
Hopefully_comma_ you've got a new friend.
Sounds like a fun time! What did you guys do? 
glad you guys got to spend some fun fam time together 
I would be so excited! 
Hopefully everything goes really well for you and happy birthday! 
Wait_comma_ what?! That's unbelievable! Why?
Riiiight...that's a stupid lie if I've ever heard one. Fight this if you can! After 10 years_comma_ they should be promoting you if anything.
That was smart to get a used one. I hope you got a good deal on it.
I think most of the time when people sell children's items you're pretty safe. And you can google to make sure of it too.
That's freakin awesome! I never win anything_comma_ go you! What band is it?
I love them!!! So jealous_comma_ hope you have a blast!
Aww_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you can find a new hobby for the weekends.
I definitely understand. It really sucks that you're so limited. 
Im so sorry to hear that. What is wrong with him?
That sounds oddly crazy and wild. Reminds me of rabies? I hope you make his last days his best and glad he wont be suffering anymore.
That is wonderful!  They must be so happy and relieved also to not have to pay!  
Oh good. I was going to ask how you felt about it.  Are you in college?
thats awesome_comma_ good for you
well that is great_comma_ very hard thing to accomplish
Strange place for something to surprise you. What happened?
Eek_comma_ I'm with Indiana Jones on this one. I hate snakes. Hope you weren't bit!
oh wow_comma_ i hate when people record those type of videos. It's really not funny to me and very inconsiderate of that person! How embrassing!
hahaha pay back is the sweetest revenge sometimes 
That is crazy! That must seem to fly by.
Yeah that must be very strange. I do not have any children_comma_ but I can imagine how crazy that is to watch them grow up!
Wow_comma_ I didn't know that! Did you have a good time?
That's wonderful! I am so glad that you had a good time. Maybe I will visit there one day.
about what?
I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ I hope your luck changes up soon!
Wow_comma_ that sounds really fun! I've never been on a cruise! How long will it be for?
Neither have I_comma_ and that's on my bucket list! So jealous! I hope you have an awesome time!
Well that's exciting! A fresh start is always fun. What inspired you to make such a big change?
Awesome_comma_ you'll be able to make friends at work. I wish you the best in your new city_comma_ congrats!
Aw man_comma_ kids can be SO lazy and don't like to do what they're supposed to. Have you tried a rewards system to get them to do what they have to_comma_ or are they too old for that?
YES. I say make them do it. Maybe take away phones_comma_ etc. if they don't get it together. No excuses for that!
Oh no how terrible. Was anyone hurt?
I bet_comma_ I would be too. Did you stop and talk to the police?
Aww_comma_ that must be kinda hard on you.
I've definitely been there_comma_ my husband is in the military so he's away often. I find it's helpful to stay busy_comma_ trying new hobbies help!
Oh no. I'm sorry to hear you are going through a rough patch.
That really does help. I hope you make it through!
I am so sorry to hear that! Have you already filed for unemployment?
If you do a Google search for your state + unemployment you should be able to find resources and might be able to file online. I'm sorry again_comma_ that's tough.
thats a big accomplishment
yea thats fair
Oh no_comma_ is your cat okay?
I can understand that_comma_ anytime I smell or see vomit I want to vomit too.
Eew! My neighbor's cat used to puke on my bed - coughing up a furball.
Not surprised - I've felt like that too. Did you manage to get it cleaned up ok?
What is that?
That sounds so awesome! And fun!
Did you ask her to kindly stop? 
She may not be the best choice of a friend if she likes annoying you so much.  Maybe try distancing yourself from her for a while.
Oh cool!  What would that be?
Aw I'm sorry.  I'm sure you'll get something you want eventually though!
That's good. As long as at gets you where you need to go. That's what matters.
Same here.
lol that is impressive
lol I bet
did you retaliate?
I'm sorry to hear that
Haha!  That's hilarious from my perspective_comma_ but must have been embarrassing for you!  What did you do?
I happens to all of us at least once in our lives!
Oh wow!  I remember the commercials too!  He looked like the coolest toy out there!  Did your daughter like it?
I guess its true_comma_ everything comes back around in style and toys and things.  That would make a fun Christmas gift! (Then you could play with it too! ha ha)
Bet you're tired. What's the speech for/about?
Ah okay_comma_ doesn't sound fun. Hope you did well and everything went smoothly!
That sounds like a lot of fun! Have you been practicing for a long time? I'm too much of a klutz to be able to do that so I respect you for it.
That's really cool. Hope you have a lot of fun!
That's a real bummer. I bet you were pretty ticked off.
Yeah_comma_ I've had that happen to me before. Some bags are cheap and fall apart.
Scary!!! What was it?  Were you terrified or just curious?
I would be too!  Did you try to see if you could see someone from another window or just run back to bed?  I'm glad you're ok!
There are a lot of people allergic to shellfish. That's a bummer though_comma_ lobster is good.
Oh no that is terrible. How did you find out it had lobster in it?
That's awesome_comma_ animals are the best! What kind_comma_ and is it a boy or girl?
Aw_comma_ that's a great friend right there. Congrats on your new puppy!
thats a bummer! do you not have a case on it?
thats good_comma_ make sure to get a case too!
How do you mean? I guess it depends on the lady_comma_ does it not?
Oh_comma_ I am so sorry - that is an awful thing to happen. But please don't think all women are like that; many are loving and loyal.
I am very sorry! That is very frustrating! Can you speak with a supervisor about the situation?
I don't blame you_comma_ I would talk to him. Even if he is uninvolved_comma_ it is not fair for you to bear the full weight of the tasks at hand. I sure hope he has a solution and the work load eases!
Oh_comma_ I bet that did irritate you! It's bad enough moving_comma_ but you don't need your furniture falling apart on you.
Yes_comma_ and possible it just had too much stuff on it. But_comma_ you're right_comma_ sometimes it's cheap wood they use.
were you scared?
I would be scared too.  It is cool that you were brave enough to try though.
Oh no_comma_ that's always really stressful. Just do your best to prepare_comma_ and try not to worry about it. Whatever happens_comma_ happens_comma_ and if you're less stressed you'll probably do better.
No problem_comma_ and I'll send good vibes your way that you pass! Good luck_comma_ you've got this.
ohh_comma_ gosh. What happened?
ohh that's bad. You seem struggling to provide food for your kids. I will pray for you_comma_ and wish you a good luck in future. But_comma_ don't shoplift again_comma_ otherwise you will get into trouble
That was so nice. What kind?
Carrot cake is wonderful!
Thats awesome_comma_ I hope you win! What are you playing?
I bet you will do great!! It sounds like you have been practicing very hard and you have the desire. That is a winning combination!!
That sounds like a nice memory_comma_ but we all grow old. Do you still spend time with them sometimes?
Yeah I agree. I have a little one myself_comma_ and I kind of with they stay that young forever.
That sounds very exciting. I am sure you will have a great time.
Those sound like fun activities. I hope you take lots of pictures so you can remember the trip.
That sounds fun. Was it a scary movie?
Oh okay. Did you watch it all alone?
What made you suspect that it might rain?
It's good that you thought ahead.
I hate to hear that! I hope everything goes well and you get better news than you are expecting.
I always try to do things to avoid thinking about things like that_comma_ maybe you could do the same!
That sounds fun! But what is cornhole? I've never heard of it before!
Okay interesting. I'd like to try is some time!
Oh_comma_ man!  That is my nightmare!  You must have been so worried!  Are you OK?
I would imagine!  That is great news!  I am sure you had a nice sigh of relief!
Ugh that is so annoying! Have you confronted him about it yet? 
Wow what a jerk...sorry you have to deal with that. I hope you can resolve that situation somehow.
you should take the docs advise and get your health under control though_comma_ its important!
good i hope you do well and stick to it!
I would be so embarrassed. I would have probably done the same thing_comma_ but I would feel so guilty.
Yeah_comma_ that's what I would probably do also. It probably won't even be that big a deal in the end.
That is great!  What a nice parent!  You must be pumped!  You should do something nice for her to show your appreciation!
That is a great idea!  Cruises are amazing.  You all will have a great time!
I'm so sorry.  What kind of t
Oh wow.  I bet that was really hard.  Hopefully next time you will win
thats awesome! what was the charity?
That is kind_comma_ when i have the means i try to donate
ohh_comma_ that's great! Now he's ready to learn life lessons. ha ha!
Ha ha! Don't be annoyed_comma_ that's what children do! believe me!
That is a wonderful attitude to have!  Being content and happy with your life is so important!
Most people always complain about what they don't have and never stop to appreciate what they do have.
That sounds like a lot of fun. I have always wanted to go to one of those shows.
I like how colorful the whole production is. It really does look amazing.
ohh that's bad. What happened?
I feel you. That happens with me every time.
Oh my_comma_ what happened to cause this?
sheesh_comma_ i'm sorry about that sharting is the worst
Omg congrats :D
Yeah at first it might feel a little lonely_comma_ but it'll be nice to have some relaxation time_comma_ right? 
That would be nice. We need some rain too. 
Thanks! Enjoy your rain!
that terrifying_comma_ i am scared to death of hurricanes
that is understandable! were you effected by harvey?
That's a real bummer. I am sure they benefited from your coaching even if they didn't win in the playoffs.
It must be satisfying to see the improvements of your pitchers. You are really helping their careers.
Cats eat everything_comma_ they are not humans
The buy yourself the food
Oh well_comma_ you cant go back and change it now
Im just saying_comma_ dont feel bad I highly doubt your one vote would have been a tie breaker anyhow.
That is good_comma_ what do you find good about the economy?
Do you think the unemployment rate is going down? 
im sorry about that! Did your son start school already?
Thats great. Thats good to hear
That is nice to hear. I hope they really like each other.
Yeah well you will find someone one day. Just be patient!
Ohh! that's so awkward! What happened then?
Yes! Maybe you should set a reminder next time! ha ha!
I'm sure it's hard waiting for the new releases when it's a game your hyped up for! I enjoy playing games too!
I enjoy RPG games the best. So_comma_ I really liked Fable_comma_ Halo_comma_ Sims_comma_ Assassin's Creed_comma_ etc.
That is so true. I agree with you
Yeah_comma_ people tend to have some harsh reviews on things and that could be troubling
whoa yeah thats awful_comma_ i wouldnt either
i agree 100%_comma_ you make a commitment _comma_ should stick too it
I stop playing videogames years ago
I prefer to read books on my free time because I am grown up
Well_comma_ he is probably lying.
Elvis only had a daugther_comma_ so the chances of him telling the true are slim
The economy is cyclical so it is bound to happen eventually.
Well the last time the economy was bad we had a different president. It is hard to say why recessions happen.
That is very true! They are very good
I am! They are my favorite team!
I am sorry to hear that! I hope your dog gets better
Thats good! I will be praying for you and him
Agree 100% it makes me want to adopt all the pets! Have you ever rescued an animal?
That's amazing. I have a rescue myself and I will never have a pet any other way.
Yes they are. I live in Oklahoma and we deal with them all the time. I have seen some really bad ones.
One year we had one hit a school in Moore and a few children died. It was so devastating. I hate tornados so much.
That is very impressive! my brother in law is starting his senior year as well
Certainly_comma_ does she have a college in mind?
Ha_comma_ you'll have to enlighten me as I don't know much about the Chargers. Are they usually not a good team or what?
That's unfortunate. How do things look for this upcoming season?
Thats wonderful! Congrats
Well that is wonderful! I would be proud as well
That's awesome. Was this the first year this particular team was together?
Gotcha. Why low expectations_comma_ did you not do well last year?
That is awesome. I bet you really helped him develop his talent.
You have made a big difference. Glad you are making a difference.
thats a horrible feeling_comma_ especially something sentimental 
i hope like crazy you find it!!
lol thats tough to deal with_comma_ have you asked if she has any friends?
ah dang dude thats kind of cold hearted
I understand that. I bet you miss them a lot.
Yeah it is rough at that age to be apart. At least you can Skype and keep in touch.
that is rude of them_comma_ they should at least wave a thank you or something
Yeah i always to make sure to thank the people that do ncie things for me
I'm sorry I don't know who that is. Was he famous?
Oh. Sounds like a big loss for Blackhawks fans_comma_ that sucks.
That is a huge moment in a kid's life! I would be too_comma_ congratulations 
I do not at the moment_comma_ but I plan to at least when I turn 35 years old
oh man thats terrible_comma_ thats a horrible feeling! 
At least everyone was still at work and you werent left there alone!
that is awesome_comma_ i bet it took a lot of hard work to accomplish
Yeah i remember a long time friend went there and it was such a pain to be able to get accepted
That's awesome! What sport is the team for?
Wow_comma_ congratulations! That is a pretty competitive league as well
i am too_comma_ i think we are headed in a better direction!
i hope so_comma_ we are def the greatest nation in the world
Congratulations_comma_ always nice to have a new addition to the family!
That is always the biggest worry when having kids and I'm happy it worked out for you guys.
a great family makes all the difference_comma_ and can get you through anything
i am also grateful to have a caring family that means the world to me
That is so great that you're cooking for her!  Did she love it?
Oh good!  You must be so proud too!  I love watching youtube recipes!  I'm so glad it turned out for you!
You must be the luckiest girl on earth
Congratulations girl :)
That sounds like a lot of fun! Is it hard to ride a mule? I've always heard they are stubborn.
Huh_comma_ well I will definitely have to try that some time. I've always wanted to ride a mule!
That's neat_comma_ whats the tournament for?
I love cornhole! I used to play that all the time when I tailgated in college. Good luck!
i didnt either! i though germany would repeat
the final match was really entertaining too_comma_ the whole cup was good!
Why would they take it off air? it was a great show
that is not cool do you think it will ever come back?
Oh no. That really stinks! I know how that feels. We like the Red Sox here.
They are having a good season_comma_ but have had many bad ones. Boo Yankees!
That is so exciting! I bet you can't wait to spend time with her!
I know_comma_ I feel the same way when my wife is gone. 
Nice!  Nothing better than driving a smooth new car!  What kind did you get?
Noice! Ha ha_comma_ that's so funny.  I have a 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee.....I bet its like night and day! Take that baby out and ride it with the windows down and the music up!
That is exciting! I hope everything goes well.
I have two boys myself! I feel like two kids is the perfect amount. Not too much to drive you insane and just enough so your first isn't lonely.
Wow_comma_ how nice. Is she always doing nice things?
Wow_comma_ you are lucky to have someone like that in your life. That's rare.
that is awesome i am really proud_comma_ college is really important for your future
im sure you will find something you like_comma_ eventually
lol some free time! what grades?
thats awesome! i hope they have a great year
im sure! its tough being at home all day without alot of interaction
Yes they are. It's a shame how dry it is.
Yes that is what it's like in my area too.
I have heard about that game. Is it a role playing game?
Oh cool. I should check it out. I like those kinds of game.
oh my goodness_comma_ i would freak if my dog ran out_comma_ he is like another child of ours
that is great_comma_ its nice to have someone that is so helpful around 
That is crazy_comma_ does your boss not care?
You could just start going in late everyday as well_comma_ to make a point to her.
i wish i could stay up late and just watch tv alone some times. i don't have any alone time.
yup.
I love winter and wearing sweaters and jeans. This summer heat is too much!
I live in the south but I'm from the north and that's one think I miss is the cooler weather. I definitely dread the summer as well.
You are more trusting then I am. I don't even trust my wife in my car.
That's very nice of you. Maybe I can learn from you and be more trusting.
that is not good_comma_ did you manage to get it done somewhere eles?
that is not good i really hope you can get it done on friday
Oh the new one comes out on Friday? I used to play it back in college a bit with my roommates.
Wow you are a dedicated player. I'd imagine you will do awesome online then.
great health and being well off is a blessing_comma_ i too am grateful for tha
i agree! its refreshing to hear someone with a good outlook on life
i live in a small town too. i grew up in a big city so the change is very welcome
small town country life is much more my speed
I can relate to that_comma_ the late night anxiety of the unknown. Hate that.
It always seems to wait til your head hits the pillow_comma_ then BAM!
oh no. is she alright?
so she probably had scar tissue. i hope this one goes better for her.
i imagine so_comma_ especially when you have no idea what to expect
lol what country are you in?
Oh man_comma_ did you put your socks on after you put your boots on? That must of been awkward getting your socks dirty. 
For sure_comma_ that is a motto to live by! I wouldn't dream of doing anything different. 
I can relate. I wish I still enjoyed them as much as I did way back then. Now I'm either out of place of it's a ghost town.
I live in a very large city on the east coast. We have one mall here called The King of Prussia Mall. It's the 2nd largest in the USA. Any time you go it's packed but if you drive 15 minutes to any of the other malls around it they are sad. Half the stores closed and no people.
Heck yeah! I myself have never been into madden_comma_ more of a NBA2k guy.
I've been playing it since I was a kid_comma_ but I always wait like 3 years in between buying them.
that is a great feeling_comma_ what are you pusuing?
man thats awesome_comma_ i have a friend who is in that field and its very interesting
i understand that for sure_comma_ finishing a task is a great feeling
congrats! was it for college?
Yes I love them they deserve to win
But don't forget that the yankees are super good 
oh no! we went through the same thing last december
i know thats right_comma_ i dont know how they survived without electric
Congratulations_comma_ looks like you guys will be saving a lot of money from no more diapers.
Haha_comma_ you can't always be 100% accurate when you first pursue a goal!
i know the feeling_comma_ it makes you wish time would slow down
thats right_comma_ going through the same feeling with my son
I don't have any kids_comma_ but I can only imagine.  It even seems like I'm growing old fast.
How old is he?
Did it scare you or did you make a new friend? It happened to me a few years ago and it turns out the dog just needed a friend. 
Go over when your neighbor is home and make friends with the dog. Take him a ball or a treat. If it happen again you know your safe.
that's great! what a good husband
I dont mind laundry as long as i dont have to cook!
that's great. it stinkswhen you have to worry about customer service giving you a hard time
exactly. some companies really try to go above and beyond
It must feel lonely_comma_ for sure_comma_ but maybe they cope with it in different ways.
Yeah_comma_ it is quite sad knowing there are some people who have literally no one.
why is that buddy
I'm glad she changed. At least now you guys can save money on food because it's cheaper to cook 
How long has it been?
Oh ok. Well that's awesome. What did you guys do?
What country are you living in?
How interesting. Do you move for your job?
Oh that's a great habit to have. Did you go to the gym?
Wow that's a great accomplishment! I need to get back to the gym too.
I don't think I have ever remembered a single friends birthday until facebook was created.
That is true_comma_ were they upset?
Probably_comma_ you just have to remember next year! 
You are very trusting. I'd just assume give my kidney to someone as 10k.
Your better then I am. I hope you don't learn a lesson the expensive way. 
Who is carrying them out?
Sounds horrible_comma_ do you think they'll get caught?
That's cool. I bet it brought back memories of your mom in the kitchen using it!
I'm guessing she was either busy_comma_ or didn't like to cook? I can relate!
Oh 
sorry_comma_ i accidentally sent that first message early.  that is great that she is going back to school.  I bet you are so proud of her
Yeah that is pretty tough. Especially when you really like to work together.
Then you have to meet their replacement and try to get to know them better. It usually isn't the same.
You must be a good cookie chef! Don't feel too bad_comma_ they should have been quicker!
Oh_comma_ you're sly! Call the cookie addiction hotline quick!
always great to see people youve been away from_comma_ happy early birthday!
lol no doubt! i got to see a bunch of friends recently at a wedding it was nice
For vacation? And yeah_comma_ the rates are pretty high_comma_ hopefully you won't be in those areas.
That's awesome_comma_ I bet it'll be in a nice secluded resort!
i grew up in miami so i know how you feel
i know what you mean. i lived thru hurricane andrew and it was traumatizing
I'm sorry to hear that. Is it drugs or alcohol?
Oh my! I thought the wrong thing. I'm so sorry to hear that_comma_ I hope he is okay!
What did you drink specifically? 
Did you eat anything?
I agree. I wish all the countries would get along. No need to be mean to each other.
Also I think all the countries should allow foreigners to visit. I don't understand why they are so territorial.
that is intense! what was it?
ahh dang_comma_ thats terrible! that is pretty bad luck
Did she take care of a bunch of dying kids?
That is good_comma_ it is nice to have a woman like that
What school did you go to?
Wow!  I'm from that area and love the Buckeyes too!
Why not?  How can you not be happy with a 6-pack?
That's insane_comma_ I hope you plan on returning that ASAP!
thats insane!! were you able to get in? and what concert?
shoot thats a bummer! hopefully they will make it up to you
Seriously.  I was looking it up the other day thinking about moving somewhere else and that state was even worse.  Then to read about everything that makes the crime rate is overwhelmingly scary.
I know_comma_ it really makes you leery of everyone around you.  There are still some good people in the world though.  I'm one of them! :)
Wow that is very far away. Do you get to visit often?
Yeah that is a bummer. Maybe one day you will live closer together.
that happened to me once i almost died. my heart was racing and then boom out pops my cat.
but what if it's just some air or something
What was the subject?
I'd imagine it's tough
That is good that you have something to protect yourself with
i completly agree_comma_ specially with the crazy people there is these days
Did they choose to switch themselves or was it out of their control?
Well maybe you guys can hang out outside of work?
That's great!  Sounds like he's a smart kid!
That's awesome_comma_ just keep him on the right path and he'll be the next Elon Musk!
That would be good. There is so much vitriol happening in society these days.
I wish people would just get along. Stop fighting each other.
It is really eating me up inside. I will make sure to pay it back with my next paycheck.
who got in?
you mean the men of the underworld?
Ok_comma_ who is competing you?
Nice_comma_ will check it up_comma_ i love indoor athletics as well
Aw_comma_ I'm sorry_comma_ why can't you?
I'm with you on that one_comma_ especially if it requires flying. No way can I afford that.
i grew up with hurricanes and those are terrifying i can imagine tornados
exactly. are you in the usa?
Wow the trifecta! Congratulations on that!
Right_comma_ I think you are in for a rowdy time for sure!
I never liked those either.  Do you have any health problems that would make you dread it?  
Don't sweat it.  You'll do great.  Its never a fun process but that's so good you're keeping up with your health!
Do you at least get to ride in it with him?
Yeah_comma_ it's always better to get motivated rather than jealous! Use it as motivation to save more money.
That is awesome. It's nice how social media can reconnect people.
I think it has its purpose. It makes it easier to find people you lost touch with.
Oh trust me_comma_ there's nothing to be jealous about! The heat is KILLER where I live.
I live in central Louisiana in the US. Our winters never really get THAT cold. I'd say coldest is 25 degrees Fahrenheit.
That's always scary_comma_ the plane starts shaking and you immediately think "We're going down!"
I bet your anxiety was through the roof_comma_ I've flown a lot and still that freaks me out.
Do you not see them much?
I can relate. I last seen my mom around 8 years ago and my dad around 10 years ago. Maybe you should move closer to them.
oh no. that is horrible
oh goodness i know right
That's awesome_comma_ what did you do to take advantage of it?
That's great_comma_ nothing beats the farmer's market.
Wow that is interesting. Did you win the case?
Great job! I would have laughed as well. Great technique to prove your point_comma_ it is always good when you can get emotion from the judge 
Oh no_comma_ I'm so sorry to hear about this_comma_ may his soul rest in peace
May his soul rest in peace and his memories live on
Well it was there for you. If someone else wanted it they would have been there first!
You are very thoughtful. I am sure he understands a chocolate craving is never to be denied!
That is wonderful!  That is a difficult instrument to master.  Was he nervous beforehand?
What a wonderful moment!  Does he want to try to take it professional and be in an orchestra or does he not know yet?
oh no. is everything ok?
did you?
i would get someone to look at it if possible to avoid any disasters
Sounds like a productive evening! What did you cook?
sounds more healthy than the chic-fil-a that I had!
i do too_comma_ flying is kinda nervewracking 
oh yes definitely
Why do you say that?
That is amazing! I bet you're excited
That stinks but I guess the law is the law. Are you going to fight it?
I know how that feels but I guess they have to pick someone and it was just your bad luck day. It can always be worse.
What kind of practice is it? That takes a lot of guts!
Not literally of course_comma_ lol. Good for her_comma_ I am sure she will do fine!
Does it make you feel good to at least think about those times though?
Yeah life comes at you fast.
oh my god i'm so sorry. i've only got one grandparent left and it's tough to even imagine not having her
i do. i'm so sorry you are having such a hard time. may you find peace in her memories.
That is always a wonderful feeling to be prepared and ready to go.  Are you a morning person?
I can understand that.  Such a great idea before the chaos of it all.  Its important to do things like that your ourselves!
You shouldn't be jealous. There is no need for that
Well that is ridiculous. Im sorry
Did you have to take a test?
That's good. If it's like mine-you had to wait forever!
Why did that happen
That does suck
What happened
I bet that will be fun
That's nice. Is he enjoying retirement
That's great. I hope to retire some day.
Do you feel like that helps or hinders your personal life?
I can relate I like to keep work at work but as an adult you spend so much time at work it's hard to meet people other places.
How beautiful! They are so much bigger when I see them than I think they are going to be.  My parents house has some land and when I bring my kids over there_comma_ we can see the young bucks eating the grass in their backyard.  
Yes!  They're legs are so much longer than I thought and they hope over they're 8 foot tall privacy fence like its nothing!
that is amazing. children can amazing you if you give them the opportunity
it's crazy the things they are learning now. it makes you feel like a dummy 
Why's that?
Are there any other types of seafood you like?
That is very sad
I am sure he did
Get ready to wait for a long time. DMVs are terrible.
Some allow you to make an appointment. You should try that.
Well_comma_ that's fun! I bet you are really excited about it.
Oh_comma_ front row tickets make it even better! Have a great time.
Oh no_comma_ I think I know where this is going. How did she manage as a waitress?
Haha oh boy! Well_comma_ on the bright side I'm sure that's a mistake she'll only make once. We all have to learn.
One of the many reasons I'm glad to have hardwood!
How have they changed the most? 
What do they do now? 
Did you end up washing dishes.
Was he upset about it?
a what?
oh i thought he wanted a baby.. dump him first
Actually my aunt is afraid of them also. She said as a girl one cornered her and wanted to hurt her. Why are you scared of them? 
Strange. Next time you have them try them cooked in goose liver fat and scotch. AMAZING!
Im sorry about that. Dont be nervous though. He is a loyal person I bet
What is the name of the company?
Were you worried at all about the cost of raising them?
Yeah_comma_ I'd imagine
Nice_comma_ what team is that you are rooting for?
No_comma_ I really dont follow sports much.
college? 
oh wow thats great.  
Big plans?
I have never been camping.
That's really nice_comma_ we don't get a lot of that these days. Makes me kind of miss the old days when people had a real sense of community.
I totally know what you mean. I live in a smaller city now and it feels a lot cozier than larger cities I've lived in before.
Why is it torture? 
Yeah_comma_ maybe next time
That must be pretty lonely. Do you talk often?
Well that should help
Well eep it up and visit when you can
how come?
haha oh no.
i bet he appreciated that at least
at least it didn't turn into one of those cheesy 80's movies
Sweet!
What kkind did you get?
I have always had hp. I do have an ipad though
Wow that's great! How old is he?
That's wonderful to see that kind of progress. You must be very proud.
That's nice of you. Is it a small dog or large?
Did it make you want one of your own?
Why_comma_ what is happening on Monday?
Those are always stressful_comma_ better study hard!
That is good_comma_ are you married?
Do you want to have kids in the future?
That's a bummer_comma_ at least it didn't go out in the beginning of summer_comma_ I guess.
Dad's are always life savers.  I love my Dad as well_comma_ he has saved me in a couple of occasions.
Yeah it sucks when people just seem to have it all.
Are you the type that's prone to getting sick?
Well that's too bad.  Yeah when you have bad genetics there aren't enough apples to keep the doctor away.
was there a reason why?
maybe it was closed event. you speak to her about it?
OH no! Were they okay?
I bet you were relieved.
Oh no that's horrible. Any idea why?
That's so strange. I'd give the power company a call and see if there wasn't a mistake.
You should find the local cafe or something
You can always google the local hot spots. You've got to get out there. It might not be easy
i used to get screwballs with my sister. those were our favorites  as kids
how awesome. it's fun to remember the good old days
i love sharing memories with my sister
I hate when that happens
I haven't had pizza ht in forever. They don't deliver in my area
Did you complain?
Well that sucks
what is with the book you are writing? people dont chat like that. yea christmas list
its all good. you are able to write very well. im jealous
ah_comma_ bummer
probably_comma_ yeah. good luck
I am sure you will do just fine!
Absolutely_comma_ and if you can start with a game for them too that would help.
Sorry to hear about that. Is it still working alright_comma_ or under warranty?
That stinks. Phones are so important these days. People always give others crap about staring at them all day_comma_ but it's because they afford us the ability to do so many things. I hope you're able to get another one soon.
Do you feel better now?
That's good It's sucks when you have to take care of yourself when you don't feel well.
I am too
I understand that as well
I can understand that. Everything is right at your doorsteps. 
That can be very rough. Maybe you can move there soon!
That sounds terrible
They are so rude
did you take him to the vet?
oh thats good then.
Little kids are pretty amazing how they can pick things like that up in the right environment. So nice you are teaching him good manners_comma_ those are in short supply in adults these days!
Poor little guy. Sounds like he's lucky to have you_comma_ especially at such a critical time in his life.
What is it for?
That's pretty cool. I am a Pharmacy Tech
That is so true. That certification was really easy. I was nervous for no reason
You will do great!
THAT must have been a nightmare. How many do you have?
That can be rough. I know I've dealt with that with my kids by giving them each 10 minutes of solo time before they go to bed. Allows them to get their energy out.
It should work! Let them pick what you do for the 10 minutes_comma_ then move to the other one. I've done puzzles_comma_ read books_comma_ and solve Rubix cubes with mine. Good luck!
where is he going and for how long?
oh i hope he is safe. i hear there is a lot popping off there right now!
Wow_comma_ that's huge! I wonder if he got sick afterward?
I bet he did lol! I would have too if I ate that much!
I am sure you are_comma_ it is nice
That is a great feeling
That is great. When did you take the test?
Was it hard or an easy test?
Congratulations! What are you studying?
Wow_comma_ that subject was always tough for me in school. Good for you!
I hate when that happens
Was this at home or at work?
Really? Congratulations! I hope you guys are really happy!
That's always awesome when the kids approve of him! I'm really happy for you guys and wish you the best!
What is happening this weekend?
Sounds fun_comma_ where at?
thats good
those sound like good people to have around
Oh that is a pickle. Congrats on the new love. Why might your parent not approve?
Ah they had certain expectations_comma_ I see. Well_comma_ you can't help who you fall in love with. Hopefully they will support you in the future.
That's great_comma_ I hope he enjoy his/her stay
How long is he staying?
Did you teach him?
Sounds like he's a natural
Something yummy I'm sure. Are you nervous? 
Perhaps some Vino with it?
Yikes_comma_ I'm not sure that will match well with Chicken Parm.
Yeah I know how that feels. I think it is part of growing up.
Kids have aversions to clean rooms. She is not the only one who does that.
I believe in that too. 
Well it think there is a time frame on the bad luck though
Christmas?
OH wow! Congratulations. First one?
Oh no_comma_ what for?
I'm sorry_comma_ I hope everything goes okay!
I can imagine! What did you have on the pizza? 
Carbs are great when you haven't had them in a while. You deserved to splurge!
I hear you! Have you tried spraying lemon etc on yourself or eating them? Helps me a lot!
Yes_comma_ it is usually if you h ave acidic blood I think- too much sugar? Try onions_comma_ garlic and lemons_comma_ generally stops them from biting me. I HATE misquitos.
i hope it turns out well for you
that doesnt sound good.
Good_comma_ were you always late?
You meant on time for home. That is good.
I can understand the feeling. What job did he get?
Oh wow_comma_ does he make a lot of money?
I think the right amount of spanking is OK.  I was spanked as a child and know I deserved it.  Hopefully you didn't take it to far though!
Don't beat yourself up too much.  Spare the rod_comma_ spoil the child.  Your guilt seems to be from what other people might think.  You know if it was necessary or not.
I still have yet to see it. I hate how hype affects things. I wish you could always get to things before they become really pumped up.I bet if you watch again sometime later_comma_ you'll find it a little better.
I never get too wild into the Marvel movies. Seems like you always know how it's going to end. To me_comma_ they're good_comma_ not great. And they can get repetitive.
I get it_comma_ I think I'd like to go back and relive the big events. I miss those the most_comma_ football games and dances.
Yeah_comma_ there wasn't much to worry about except classes and whatever drama was going around at the time!
My girlfriend always likes to wait until the needle is past empty. I never let it get past half-way empty. I don't get how she deals with that stress in her life! And to me_comma_ it makes no sense. But I guess she hates spending the money on it_comma_ so she waits.
One time_comma_ she actually forgot to turn the car off while pumping gas. She just stuck the thing in_comma_ and went inside the shop. I was in the passenger seat... I stopped_comma_ looked for a second and thought_comma_ "Wait_comma_ can you do that now...?"
Well that's nice of you to do that for them. I bet they enjoy the treat.
Maybe you could try putting it on a cute bird feeder so it'll be a little easier for them?
They might've taken out a loan they can't afford.
At least it's paid of and you don't have to worry about payments on it.
What's that? Drink?
Bad or Genius? 
Oh that sounds awful. I am sorry you had to see that.
That's good that you can see a positive in that. You must be a very strong person.
I would be too_comma_ I never win those things!
Very true! Congrats! It's hard to never win
Yes_comma_ I'm sure it makes you anxious. But_comma_ no sense in worrying!
I know it's probably hard not to worry. But_comma_ it really doesn't change the outcome_comma_ ya know!
 Cheer up buddy_comma_ it's all in the mind
I believe there must be a good thing that happened these past few years. Count the good ones and block the bad memories out
By being a decent person...I'm not a cheater and could never..I am very monogomous..Why would you get married if you wanted that?
I think so. Having integrity and good character would stop you from doing that_comma_ would you want to be cheated on? You should be honest with your partner..or work on and water your relationship if you don't like it the way it is. Cheating after 10 years would truly make you a terrible person to waste someone elses life for 10 years only to go through such a betrayal.
what happened?
on purpose?
That's great. How long was he gone?
Wow. Was he hurt at all?
That is a good feeling
I do agree with you
I bet! I am glad you have a good relationship with a sibling! That's rarer nowadays
How far are you guys apart in age?
That's terrible_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that.
I hope she makes it up to you.
I love shrimp nachos_comma_ but any nachos are good really
What do you put on your nachos?
Wow_comma_ that's really extreme. You should feel bad about it.
What do you need to leave?
How cool is this? I won free ice cream for a year from my local creamery!
It was a raffle!
I can understand that! I actually attempted a diet about a month ago_comma_ and it was miserable. What made you give it up?
That seems like the best option. It is hard to stick to a diet for a set amount of time. The weight always seems to return.
Did you roll down your window and yell at him?
Gagging? So you don't do that? 
Oh really? Is that your favorite month?
That sounds like a lot of fun! Which mountains?
I love pizza
I am sorry
Its hard to find people to help move.
That's good that your brother helped. My daughter I moved alone.
was he hurt?
oh thats good
Oh no! Did you end up finding out who did it?
I would go to HR about it and let them know. 
How come?
Oh no! Your friends didn't offer to buy you a drink or something? I would if I wanted my friend to come
That sounds delicious! How nice of her!
She sounds like it! You're lucky to have such a caring mom!
What is the name of your band?
That's a lot. What kind of music do you play>
Where'd they go?
It takes some getting used especially since you haven't been alone in a while.
What kind of shoes?
Converse go with everything too!
I love the beach. We can only go once a year!
Well. you will get back there.
That is sad. Sometime pets are iirreplaceable.
What was her name?
I am sorry_comma_ that is terrible
You will get through it
sorry to hear that. what age group
hah.. thats cool
That would be great.  They don't tell you in advance_comma_ you just have to find out when you get the check?
That's good and bad I guess.  It would probably be nice to be able to plan on it.
That is nice_comma_ the ones I use play the same songs over and over!
I agree_comma_ and most of the music is older music_comma_ too.
Oh no_comma_ that's so awful. Were you able to recover?
Yea. That would make me cautious as well. I hope nothing like that happens again to you.
I'd be mad too! Do you have any idea who could have stolen it?
That's terrible. Well you know what they say about karma_comma_ they'll get theirs eventually.
Don't go check! lol
Oh lol. Well if you have a weapon keep it near you.
Why?
That is definitely a no- no
oh wow! what did they get?
wow camaros are awesom.i just got a new suv
Why he is so much better then the other option. I mean they were all crazy but I can't imagine a regime under Clinton. 
Honestly they are both crazy. It's a sad time when those two were the best we had to offer.
I would hate that
I would too
oh thats sweet. is he paying for insurance too? :)
oh well.. at least you got some wheels.. beats taking the bus or walking
Why do you do that
That is not too bad
I know that feeling
IT is the worst. My landlord take forever to get things fixed.
awesome! What are you studying?
Thats a great career! We need good counselors in schools!
I am so sorry to hear about your dog_comma_ did you rescue her?
I bet so_comma_ I am glad you were able to save her!
jesus lord...I hope you kicked her out or left!
She is a (fill in the blank) she cheated and betrayed you and your marriage...she would never win in court after cheating. I am so very sorry. There is nothing like being betrayed by someone you love
Did you call an animal shelter?
Did you give him some food?
OH no! Did every one hear?
That's so bad lol
That's great! I wish mine did but they're dreading their first day back tomorrow.
Maybe it will_comma_ I'll keep my fingers crossed for you!
oh thats good.. did you get to keep some pictures?
wow that was a good idea
Oh I am sorry to hear that_comma_ but I am sure there might be an even better one out there for you.
It's a tough_comma_ going through the job market in general. Persistence is the key. You'll get one.
I can understand that. It can be quite scary.
That is a long time to not be alone!
Cangratulations!!!!  Is this your first child?
That will be the best Christmas present ever!
That's never a fun situation_comma_ I always bring someone.
Meet somewhere public like a store parking lot.
The entitlement everywhere is terrible! Did you find out who did it?
Well..you could put a box of something that looked good and put "don't touch" and put exploding ink in it- Then you will know ;)
did you call the cops?
that sucks. karma will come
Oh! Mine broke too this past weekend but I got a new one as it was just a cheap dirt devil. I am glad yours is fixed!
Yes $200 is expensive. It is always good to fix them if you can_comma_ especially for the nicer ones
Oh man doesn't that just make you want to take a car and run right..... Just kidding.. but yeah that would make my blood boil
Yes! I agree! I guess a lot of people say 3 strikes and your out_comma_ I'm done_comma_ but for me_comma_ I dont care who you are_comma_ I just dont give even second chances to most people!
I love Christmas
Does everyone live far apart?
I know what you mean because I do it too
hahaha you don't say :)
But now you have a new pet to live with you
Haha I love them. They eat other pest like bugs and mice. Wait until you cat dose that again.
That sounds fun! Do you have a boat or jet skis?
Oh for sure! I love riding jet skis!
That is great to hear.  What is making you so happy?
Great news.  Kids are always an exciting adventure!
That was very nice of her. What did you do with the money?
That is a good use of the 100 bucks. I am sure you will pay it forward at some point.
Yeah_comma_ they're sometimes hard starts to the week. Did anything bad happen to you this monday_comma_ or was it just slow-moving? Hopefully things pick up for you.
Man_comma_ that's terrible. I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully you can recover. 
Oh no_comma_ I have been there! I hope everything goes okay!
Don't worry about it_comma_ worrying will only make things worse.
Oh no! Were you home when it happened?
I'm so glad you weren't there but I still hate to hear it. Did they take anything valuable?
I understand.  I don't like bad weather either.
Was it a tornado?
What kind of band
I like that music
Ugh I hate when people do that! Did they even leave a note?
Of course. Well karma will get them one day. At least it wasn't a full on accident where you could've gotten injured.
oh wow.. i call that a win!
thats awesome
I bet it can be easy for that to happen in the spur the moment
You'll have a shot at it again_comma_ I'm sure!
What is that? A video game?
No worries_comma_ we all have our hobbies!
aww. i can imagine that its really different now in the house.
i felt the same avout my moms dog when he passed.something was missing in the house.
I hate that! Where they're probably friendly_comma_ but because they're so big_comma_ you have no idea what could or would happen_comma_ so you get so defensive..
My brother has a large lab_comma_ although they're pretty sure it has to be part of something else_comma_ because it's over a hundred pounds and looks much bigger than a normal lab. She's a sweet dog_comma_ has the energy of a puppy though_comma_ so she comes tearing at you with speed and you think you're about to die.. But she's just being playful.
I'm sorry to hear that. What's been going on?
Troubling times do make us extra vulnerable.
Any gf or bf? That would be scary yet wonderful!
I would take someone who would be thrilled about it :)
Oh NO...That should be reserved for the worst prisoners. That hurts!
That's understandable. I bet people have had those stuck in their feet before
Oh no no no no no! Thats no man! If you aren't going to fix it then earn money to hire someone who will!
Yes! I would agree! I feel bad your in that situation!
yea it can really hit hard
yea i know how you feel
What kind of job is it?
Wow! That takes a lot of schooling_comma_ I hope you do too! Is it a good company?
Why are you happy
I am happy for you
I have been there before. Sometimes you just need to relax!
It is_comma_ we all need time for ourselves!
what are you studying?
oh wow that sounds impressive. good luck!
That is awesome! Are you going to celebrate?
How fun! I hope you have a great time!
What kind of game is that
It sounds cool
And what was the verdict?
Hard work goes a long way!
I love days like that! Hopefully you got a chance to play outside?! ;-)
So fantastic that you could take advantage of it -- *and* get to make some memories with your kids!
yes technology is great
yea and now smart phones are everything!
Why did it irk you? was he not suppose to be there?
Have you confronted him about it yet?
Did you not pass?
Awesome! I am happy for you!
Kids are the best
That sounds very nice
Aw_comma_ that's no good_comma_ are you going to buy new ones or patch them up?
Sorry to hear that_comma_ hopefully someone will help you out with that.
Nothing to be ashamed about.  There are lots of people much older that are still into gaming.  If you're really good you could actually make money on it!
Hahaha.  Nothing says you can't do both.  Work at work_comma_ play after work.
that was really nice of them _comma_ they are good co workers 
Thats very heart warming to hear
How'd it go?
Sounds like an old coaster they should consider replacing.
That sounds exciting! Are you going to see him for the holidays?
I hope you have a great time!
What school are you applying to?
That is a tough school to get into. Best of luck.
That's pretty cool.  How long have you been together in this relationship
Well have a safe flight and make sure you make the most of it!
Oh_comma_ that's...interesting. That does sound like a nice change of plans_comma_ not only because Starbucks not seem that fun anyway. Hopefully she returned the favor?
Well_comma_ hopefully she doesn't keep you waiting for very long_comma_ if everything else is right! But maybe be more patient than even you think you need to be in order to play it safe_comma_ so she doesn't get scared off_comma_ so to speak. Sounds like it will be worth it in the end.
Why don't you get one then_comma_ so cute.
That sucks. I hope that changes in the future for you.
That really stinks. Maybe they will take the hint?
Well that's good!
That's awesome to hear!
That's good news. Congratulations in advance!
Why do you say that
That is not your fault
She must have a golden heart
I hope you have showered her with gifts and appreciation_comma_ she deserves it
yea_comma_ this is a much better time for content
yea i can see that also
Oh no. Did anything happen?
Hopefully_comma_ you won't have to walk when it's dark out again or at least have people to walk with you.
Do you guys still keep in touch with video chats and phone calls?
Thats what helped me when I moved away.  Video chatting makes it feel like youre still there
What is so creepy
I am sure you are finr
Oh no_comma_ what happened?
It happens_comma_ you can't beat yourself up about it_comma_ it was an accident!
That sucks. Are you going to tell your boss?
Well that's a good attitude
congratulations! that is an awesome achievnment 
that is always a perfect combo!
That is bad. Did you do it on purpose?
Mistake can easily happened. Nothing to worry about.
how was the game!
thats cool
Why were you impressed
I am not sure it was
That would have made me sad _comma_ poor kitten 
I love animals _comma_ i would feel the same as you
wow surprise gifts are the best!
what a good friend. I'm glad you had a good birthday
I do as well
What happened then
Is he doing better?
Well that's good. I bet he appreciated you taking care of him_comma_
That is sweet and sentimental.
I am happy that you have that to remember him by.
Was it a birthday party?
Oh congratulations!
Oh man_comma_ I forgot about Cracker Jacks.  I always looked for the prize
It always makes me think about baseball when I think of Cracker Jacks
Oh no_comma_ that must have ruined the round!
Hopefully you got a refund.
I am hoping as well
That would be very nice
sounds like a good friend to have by your side
thats good!
Thats understandable! Just be yourself and Im sure you will do great!
A tip someone gave me once is to make sure to have really good posture as it makes you appear less nervous! Fake it till you make it! Good luck!
Oh no_comma_ that classic prank! I bet that was painful_comma_ I've only seen it on movies.
Haha_comma_ wow_comma_ that's awesome.  Sort of makes up for him playing that prank on you.
cheer up buddy_comma_ everyone have experienced that at one point or the other
no worries buddy_comma_ the experience will make you stronger
For a test? It's good that your confident_comma_ that's key!
You'll get the highest grade_comma_ I'm sure!
Oh that's good! Any special reason?
Oh that is wonderful news! Congratulations!
Making new friends can be tough_comma_ is there anyone at work you bond with?
I am sure that you will meet some new friends@
That is amazing_comma_  Is there a certain reason she cant swim_comma_  she just never learned?
was her life jacket fancy?
That must've been terrifying in your dream.
I hope you don't have many of those dreams again.
did you pass?
hard work pays off!
Why were you scared
I do as well
Wow sounds like you need a new store..haha
Do you wear glasses or do you have 20/20 vision
Thats good_comma_  Give it some time_comma_  Did everything go good_comma_ besides the high and dry?
That sounds good_comma_ Give it time_comma_ she will come around.
I'm so sorry_comma_ are you okay?
I hope you will feel better.
I did see that
He wont win anything
I'll keep my fingers crossed that it's good for you! Is that your favorite food?
I didn't know it was healthy!
Curiousity gets to ya sometimes.
hahaha so why did you watch it?
that is such a bomber_comma_ will you still be able to go on your trip?
that's not good at all _comma_ have you tried asking for someones car?
Oh no_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm sure it was. Did insurace cover what was lost?
I hope you do_comma_ too! I have always hated group work.
I guess so_comma_ I just hate that my grade would depend on someone else's work.. or lack there of.
That is great_comma_ what school did he go to?
Wow that is a tough school to get into. Did you pay the tuition?
That is so annoying.  I thought they were not supposed to be allowed to call anymore.
I heard they are based outside of the country and make calls out of reach of the law.  Like I said_comma_ ANNOYING!
im sorry to hear that.. old age?
he lived a long life.
Oh no_comma_ were you able to track it down?
Aw sorry to hear that_comma_ hope he/she is fine and you'll able to find it.
I bet that was nice
I am sure you will
I am so sorry for your loss. How was was he?
He had a good life_comma_ yea?
Were you scared
I would be too
It's not good to be jealous of your friends.
I'm glad you made that connection.
Gee that's sucks. Have you tried contacting them?
That's terrible service. I hope you get it resolved soon!
Wow. I guess she really has no care for social constructs.
it would make me lose my appetite. Oh well_comma_ what could you have done?
Why are you hesitant
Then just tell him no.  If it's meant to be he'll respect it
yes and staying away from addicts is always good as well! Pick a different hobby for sure that's healthy is good!
YES! I used to be very social but I have had enough of that and now I am happy to be at home and at peace :0
What game was it?
Oh that sounds fun! Did you go in person or watch on tv?
That was nice of them
I bet you were
It is good to find some time for ourself to rest.
That is great.
That's really rude of them_comma_ I guess no one taught them manners.
Someone else should have looked out for you_comma_ though.
That's very sweet to even reach that age and to retire! I hope he gets to do fun things now?
You don't know?
It has been long
I do too
I agree. I put a lot of effort into my work and I hate when things are half done.
I am sorry! I have been there before and it is no fun!
Wow thats super exciting.  I hope you do too.  What would you go for?
Very nice.  I think youll get it.  I believe in you
That's very nice of her_comma_ not too many left that would offer to do that for a stranger.
That's really cool_comma_ hope you two become BFFs!
Oh no!  im sorry_comma_ I have been there before too many times.  Just know everything happens for a reason 
Good! I try my best to live by that.  Its hard sometimes though_comma_  Life is weird.
Well thats not good
I guess you did
Must've been embarassing.
Were you walking and suddenly tripped on something you didn't see?
Oh man_comma_ how come?
Oh that is a bummer_comma_ maybe you can around work as it's worth it :)
Oh no. Did you take out a payday loan?
I'm sorry to hear that. Well_comma_ I hope it's over with soon.
I hear they are good
They are talented for sure
What did your brother do?
That's really nice of him. Sounds like you won the sibling lottery.
Wow that's nice. How was the taste?
Oh I see! Still_comma_ a great gesture to get a cake.
Your roommate is awesome. I'm glad you weren't stranded.
I had horrible roomates. I'm glad you gotta keeper.
That's creepy_comma_ do you think you're in trouble for something or is it someone random?
I would do so just as a precaution_comma_ can never be too careful!
I feel the same way! I mean_comma_ my Facebook feed is full of all this garbage.
I actually use a special extension on my browser so I can block certain things like this on my Facebook! You should try it!
you must be nervous_comma_ but im sure you will be fine
hahaha that might be a small proble_comma_ but nothing to be worried about
Dang! I hate when that happens.  It's always the day you don't expect it to happen_comma_ it happens.
That's always a nice alternative_comma_ could be worse.
Oh man_comma_ I should do that_comma_ too.
That's good. What did you get for preparation?
Oh_comma_ I'm so very sorry! I know it's very hard to lose a loved one_comma_ I lost my sister_comma_ father_comma_ and both sets of grandparents.
Yes_comma_ even though it's part of life_comma_ it doesn't make it any better when it happens. I hope it starts to get better for you soon.
Nice where are you headed
That's pretty awesome :) is it your whole family going_comma_ or just you and a significant other
wow sound serious. you do this everyday?
thats a nice committment you got there. congrats
I would love that car
I am in the same boat
What game will you be going to?
I love baseball_comma_ who is playing in the game you are going to?
Not a lot of people are loyal. Who is this someone?
Being a punching bag in a relationship is no good. It's a 2 way street. Is your partner doing their part?
That's pretty awesome! I feel my skin jump a bit when I see how much people spend on one day
I feel the same! No use spending that on something that will be eaten either
Oh_comma_ how do you feel about that?
Are you going to allow it then?
How did they feel about that?
I can understand not wanting a big wedding_comma_ I wish I would have made a different decision.  Good for him.
That is such a noble thing to do.  Do you work with an organization or on your own.
That makes sense.  Well_comma_ you are doing a lot of good.
Wow_comma_ that's great! How old is he?
That's great_comma_ it can take awhile for boys to get the hang of it all.
That is very lucky
I am glad she did
That's awesome that your dad helped you out with math.
Was? Is he no longer around?
That's so sad! I'm glad you have something to remember him by.
He will always live on through spirit in your heart. I'm sorry for the loss.
Ah_comma_ that's too bad. But exciting at the same time! Do you have a particular car in mind?
Yes_comma_ I heard the same thing! Cheap on parts too!
i would have been as well_comma_ going on vacation is really fun. are you going with family?
that is really fun place to go with family_comma_ i was there last year and really enjoyed it
Well I hope that it turns out well!
Yeah that makes a lot of sense. Good thinking!
Wow. Sounds like you have a wonderful boss. Sarcasm by the way.
Is he always this way?
Its just a boat
I can get that sometimes
Seems like a silly thing to be nervous about_comma_ unless you're a terrible driver.
Well_comma_ to each their own. They have driving classes if you ever feel like you need them.
That's amazing. What was the meeting about?
You earned it! Good job!
That was nice of her.  How did it come out?
Awesome.  What color is it.  Happy Birthday by the way!
I am with you on that one
I hate it
Congratulations to him. Is he younger or older?
Ah so you're the young one. Do you look up to him?
You need to induldge every once and awhile_comma_ right?
I heard they can keep you from hitting a pleateu.
Aw sorry to hear that...why is she moving
nice well if you keep in touch everyday maybe it won't feel so far
oh yea? did you try to keep up with him?
ah thats true
That must have been fun! I love dogs. What kind was it?
Fun_comma_ I have a friend who has one of those. They're very playful.
It was? What made it hard specifically? Hopefully nothing too bad happened.
Yeah_comma_ I'm with you. I hate going to especially Walmart_comma_ because it's so freaking crowded all the time. It's a hassle getting even the shortest shopping list. But I'm on a budget and it's where I have to go.
Thanks for the awesome tip. I appreciate you trying to think of an alternative for me! I'll give it a look.
Very true! Maybe a gioter and she needs more minerals_comma_ thats what it is a lot.
yes! Research is a life saver_comma_ never just rely on doctors..they almost killed me and many I know. I hope it's not too bad!
Almost all my family members have smoked at one point in time. I feel bad for the people that get caught in the addiction_comma_ and I wish I could help them quit. Sorry to hear it's such a hassle enough that you had to do it inside.
Hey_comma_ I really hope you do. It was partly why my dad had a stroke and then had health problems the rest of his life. But I'm sure you get that all the time. You have to do it for you_comma_ not because of horror stories and all that. I hope you get through it_comma_ though.
Aw_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ is she getting up there in age?
Hopefully they will diagnose her correctly and she becomes her normal self. Fingers crossed!
Is it working well still
Its nice to have
How'd it go?
I'm glad you're getting used to it now.
Oh yea_comma_ the Teslas look pretty amazing!
Maybe they'll be more affordable and even slicker when you get around to it.
That's a very supportive family you have.  I'm right there with you on the credit_comma_ mine is not too good.
Make sure you tell them you love them when you see them next! :)
Thats super sketchy of him.  I never accept checks from people.  Only cash. just in case
hopefully you will still get the money
I do not like mine as well
That is annoying
How was it?
I have no idea what kind of ingredients you even put in a mug cake?
Pretty much they have problems in their own lives.
Yep. If people were truely happy_comma_ they wouldn't have time to troll others.
That's awesome. Sounds like you were well prepared for it.
That's great! Congratulations on getting it!
oh thats nice. do you all have plans?
that sounds great.
That sounds fun! Do you have a first date planned?
Ah okay_comma_ good plan. I'm sure she will go out with you. Just don't sound too desperate. 
Wow. Must be a sight for those behind you all this time.
It's ok. I'm sure everyone has their embarassing moments.
That is awesome.  it is great when a schedule works out.
You know that's right.  I love food_comma_ although I just recently became a vegan.
I wish I had a car.
Only if i find the money
I am sure it will
I bet it smells nice
That sucks. Maybe there's a next time?
I hope you'll get another opportunity or even a better one.
How did you do that can you remember the last place you had it? 
I know was it an important sentiment to your family? I hope it comes up eventually.
Why is that
That does sound fun
My brother used to always do that to me.
Family should help as much as possible.
maybe you should try making some again
ah ok
That's awesome. Job hunting can be difficult.
I feel sorry for th 19 people who didn't get it.
I bet it will be okay
It happens to everyone
Have you talked to him about it? Why wouldn't he be able?
Ah_comma_ work always seems to find a way to get in the way.
Heck yeah! I love the fair_comma_ mainly for the food and people watching!
Yum! Don't forget about the corndogs.
Is it a pretty decent raise?
I'll keep my fingers crossed that it happens for you. I don't think a boss would give a hint like that for no reason!
That's terrible. Did you find your dog?
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you find him soon.
who won
ah sounds like the smart move
What i that?!?! i think ive heard the name before maybe.
I see_comma_  What happened? bad recipe?
Oh god. That's awful. I guess she never came back?
I hope she was able to fend for herself. I'm sorry she went through that loss.
I wish i could make that type of money!
Money is what runs the world.
Cool congrats I can never win those
Well aren't you the Lucky the Leprechaun...how much have you won so far
Why is that
That is cool I guess
That is the story of my life.
The weekends are for the boys!
Gotta hate weather like that when you're trying to get somewhere. You ok?
That's good. So many peole just drive faster.
She seems work hard
That is sad
She's one lucky girl!
How long have you guys been together?
hopefully you do_comma_ and remember the movie trailers and commercials take a while before the actual movie plays
do you have a date ?
Why? Whats going on this weekend?
Oh my gosh thats exciting.  You're going to have such a fun time.  I love roller coasters
And if you need to_comma_ just close your eyes
What is happening Friday?
oooh that's exciting!  I hope you get good news on Friday!!  
they must be a really good resturaunt
those are definitely reasons to keep going back_comma_
i bet! congrats
that was awesome of you all
Did you end up going out?
I'm so happy for you.
That sounds so gross
It sounds that way
I love sauces like that
I do agree
Oh yum! I love cake! That was nice of her!
Ill bet it was! I hope you thanked her! Cake takes time and effort to make!
That sounds exciting! The hard work will pay off. I've always wanted to camp. Have you done it before?
Is it just you_comma_ or will others be joining you?
I've really glad you and your do are getting along well. Dogs are mans best friend after all!
Yeah but it is worth it because now you have a loyal and obedient partner. 
Wow. What happened?
That's gotta be embarassing.
That is awesome_comma_ normally it is the opposite!
Your dog is an angel!
Sounds like a goal to me. Good luck!
You're welcome. Goals is what makes life matters sometimes.
I'm eating some pepperoni pizza as I'm typing this.. washing it down with some beer_comma_ my kind of Tuesday night
What are your default pizzas.  Mine are Little C's or Dominoes
Was the dog okay
I am glad you did
did they?
thats good
That's awesome! you and me can go eat!
Hopefully it is a great place to eat and we enjoy it!
I agree!
Yeah they are horrible
Reminds me of when I was younger_comma_ but I always acted like I liked it to make her happy.
Just make sure you drop the hint in a nice way!
That's a long drive.
Any way for you to maybe go to them next time?
What kind of car is it?
Nice!  I would secretly be a little envious myself_comma_ they are nice cars.
It will figure itself out_comma_ always does
I am sure it will be
What happened?
Did find your dog?
what are you going to do with it ?
oh thats cool
That is the way to go! Keep it up!
Work is pretty great and makes a bunch of money!
That is crazy
That is funny
That's some dedication!
Good luck! I'm sure you'll do great!
I would have cried for multiple days!
Do you have a new place to eat?
That's no fun. I had a cat that would escape all the time too. Did you get it back?
That's not too bad. I had to pick mine up at the animal shelter. 
I hope you do well
I can tell
That's not cool. Will you get it fixed?
Sounds like a plan.
That is bad
I can imagine
i would have been to. what happened?
oh_comma_ well that happens
where were his parents?
ah that stinks
Aww!  Maybe it's time to start building yours!
Maybe you should start saving up some extra money so you can make yours better!!
That is a good thing
She sounds amazing
Oh yuck! Sounds like a disgusting experience.
Haha that must have felt a bit satisfying at least. Glad you took care of them.
Right on_comma_ glad to hear it. I hate utility bills and how unexpectedly high they can be. I especially hated living with roommates who didn't mind getting them really high_comma_ just for the sake of having it a little cooler.
I hope it stays that way for you. Luckily I'm in an apartment now where the utilities are included_comma_ so I don't have to stress about what it's going to be_comma_ or confronting my roommates.
Marriage is a very hard thing.
I like all of my partners too much.
Ohh yeah_comma_ that sounds really good.
I see_comma_ what are you going to do to make sure it doesn't happen again?
That's terrible! Why did you feel scared?
Oh no_comma_ I always feel the same way. I usually avoid areas like that.
oh thats good that he felt comfortable enough to tell you
thats cool that he was able to come out on his own terms
That's rad_comma_ those are slick looking cars!
It's time to one up him and get a Porsche!
It is a good thing that you care.
I wish I lived in your fine community.
Sounds like you prepared well_comma_ congratulations! What do you think you got?
That's always a good sign.  When you feel good about it_comma_ you did well.
oh man! i would also be irate. why the delay?
i hate fight delays
Date them both? Then pick which one you like the most.
you should bite first and take them both home!
That's too bad..you sure it was the milk and not something else?
Can you drink any dairy? Or is that totally off limits
Did you kick him in the shen?
Okay_comma_ maybe punch him in the nose.
Then what happened?
I didn't understand you.
Did you do well
You will do better next time
Did someone punch you?
Maybe someone kicked you in the eye!
I dont believe that
Just dont give up
There is no such things as happy days
Happy days fly away so quickly.
Oh no_comma_ that's terrible! Do you know who did it?
I hope it's not too expensive to fix!
well thats gross
i can only imagine
That's a real positive spirit!
I like your attitude. 
Hopefully it's not a big one that would cause serious damage_comma_ I assume? Otherwise_comma_ I kind of like storms. I like the sound of rain_comma_ and the visual aspect. It's the best when you get to fall asleep to them.
I live near the coast_comma_ and we have hurricane scares all the time. For some reason_comma_ people love to stay behind and just face the storm. They're fearless and think everything will be okay_comma_ even when sometimes it's not. I guess they're just determined to stay by their homes and not abandon them_comma_ which I can understand. I'll hope for the best for you!
I've never had the guts to do that_comma_ even though I've wanted to on multiple occasions. What happened_comma_ if you don't mind me asking?
That's the worst... So it wasn't even just taste_comma_ it was about health.. Dang. I don't know if I could ever go back there again. It'd always be in the back of my mind. Glad you caught it early and didn't go home with too much food poisoning.
that is good.i always loved sports as a kid and did well
it is a great way to learn that.im glad i was able to learn those values.
I agree....were you just looking through some photos or what
smh time flies now that you mention it...I was just going through old fb beach pics of me and an ex I was planning to marry but we fell off and it hits me like a sucker punch every time
Congratulations! what do you do?
Sounds like you have some real talent there.  Keep up the good work.  I bet you'll be famous one day!
what is it worth?
hah thats awesome.. canceled of course.. but awesome
I do not even have a dog
I have always wanted one.
I am glad it was resolved.
I sure hope that happens.
That's awful news! I don't want to sound cruel but at least this could maybe be a period of your life where you can just focus on you and improve a lot of areas of your life. You could look at it like a second chance.
Yeah_comma_ that happened to my roommate recently. I didn't try to give him too much specific advice_comma_ because most of it is just useless. I just tried to help him realize the best he can do is be patient_comma_ because time makes everything feel better_comma_ or at least hurt less.
conrats. what did you get?
oh nice
why what happened?
i would feel the same way
Now I feel bad about talking to you.  Do you mind talking to me?
Who are these people?
Is it your baby.
We will see once the baby comes out and is tested!
I feel that way every day almost_comma_ Did you ever end up doing it?
What made you so tired??
Did she find out you broke your promise?
It's great that you both were able to work it out.
I love swimming!
No no! Forget those shorts! be you!
Nice. What was the award for?
Congratulation.
Sheesh that's heavy.  Sorry to hear that.  Have you talked it over yet or no
Well maybe it's for the best.  Good luck
You are not the only. Nothing to worry about.
I am a guy. Why this question?
That sounds like a fun weekend! Did you go swimming?
That sound fun! I love to eat fresh fish!
Hey that sounds like an awesome day!  
Good for you my friend!  We all need days like that!
Oh no_comma_ poor little thing.
I am so heartbroken thinking about it.  I'm sorry.
Oh WOW!  That is a lot of cakes!!  Will you be able to get it all done?
Well more power to you!  I don't think I could do that in one night - you must be a good baker.
Man_comma_ I'm jealous! I'm still a college student_comma_ barely paying rent! And nothing but student loans to look forward to. I probably should have taken your path in life. Not to say you haven't worked very hard for it_comma_ because I'm sure you have.
Hey I really appreciate that advice. I need to take it. I'm horrible at setting goals. I just move in a general direction. I need to break things down step by step. We'll see how it goes.
sorry to hear that_comma_ my brother has a drinking problem too_comma_ and has kids_comma_ i love him but at this point we are more focused on the kids _comma_ i tell him if you get locked up who is gonna raise the girls _comma_ of course we are but still they need a father 
all you can do is stay positive _comma_ all we can hope is our brothers will one day wake up before its to late 
I never win and i play all the time!
This is very true!
why is that
thats cool
awesome.  When are they coming and for how long?
Thats a long trip.  I hope they have a good time
Right now I am sure is too early!
We are going in December and it is going to be magical.
UGH thats the worst_comma_  I once ran my car dry of oil..oops.
I try to get a change every time the sticker says_comma_  thats one thing i dont mind paying for.
I would have cried for years.
Life does throw things at us.
oh awesome.. i couldnt never do that
you should be fine
Did something bad happen?
Oh man.  I hope he is alright_comma_ I would be nervous too
What?! I would have been livid! Did they compensate you?
ohhhhh maybe turn it into a little vacation
Oh no! Hey_comma_ I wouldn't say a better man. I'm sure you are just fine for someone else. She didn't deserve you.
Okay_comma_ yeah a lot of people seem to have that problem. Maybe you can learn from it for next time.
So_comma_ the women only like you because you have money?
Well_comma_ on paper you are like a dream catch_comma_ no doubt about it.
Do you mean "out" of control
Yes I'd agree with you. I still think it's hilarious that he's president...didn't think know Republicans had such a scarce lineup
how is it going?
thats the way to be! 
Hey that's awesome!  What kind of job is it?
Oh.  Wait.  What?
It's easy to be intimidated by pretty girls.
You really don't_comma_ I agree.
Oh my_comma_  do you ever geta  weird feeling when it looks at you?
That is crazy! maybe its you from the future!
That sound like a lot of fun! Will it be your first time?
That's sounds like a great experience. I hope you enjoy it!
It is so hard to wait.  What console did you get?
That is so awesome.  I hope it gets there before this weekend so you can binge it!
oh no what did you do
damn that stinks
Wow_comma_ was it difficult? do they eat alot.
mmmm delicious
Why? What happened? Is everything okay?
Yes_comma_ loneliness can be quite sad.
Is that a good thing?
Great! That is how it should always be :) 
Ah that's difficult. Maybe you can see if there are any sports teams you can join?
Yeah I know what you mean. I'm in a similar situation right now as well.
Ouch_comma_ I hate it when that happens. Did you say anything to them?
That's super rude. Hopefully karma will take care of that. 
no_comma_ facebook is the devil!
yea i guess thats true
Oh sports...I have no idea about this subject. Lakers is basketball right?
Great! Is that your favorite sports team?
Yaya! what are you going to spend it on?
Amazing! i need some luck like that in my life.
Aww dangit!  You might have to hide it better lol
I know right??  Maybe you should buy some bad makeup and let her steal that
I love my little dog too! You are a great owner.
Yes_comma_ animals are our best friends.
Well it is natural_comma_ maybe bad food choice?
Oh you shouldn't be. Don't eat before church though ;)
god it repaired ?
thats cool.
Yeah_comma_ I wouldn't get too down. Statistically_comma_ there's not much of a chance of ever winning.
Yes I agree. I would be amazing to win the lottery.
It's good to always try and think positive.
That is a great attitude to have. It would be nice if more people saw it like that.
Congrats on getting him that far! What did he study?
Thats a great job to have in this world. I bet he is excited to get started working?
Getting out of work is the greatest feeling.
I love to enjoy my free time too.
why is that?
ah yea ... i can understand that
Oh my god_comma_  was he a homeless man?
Oh my god_comma_  Thats actually crazy
That sounds so sad.  I'm sorry you aren't feeling happy.  What is going on?
Where did he go?
Why was it  scary movie that did it?
Well were there any?
I would be too. What kind of couch do you have?
Ohhhh_comma_ yeah they are very inspiring. I wish mine didn't die yesterday from a concussion.
I've never had a friend return stuff for me_comma_ that sounds like a super caring friend
OH! I thought you mean he returned them to a store_comma_ like a bad purchase. Oh man you were drunk! Thats pretty bad lol- But nice friend still
Dang_comma_ those things are creepy! Did it go away?
Yeah_comma_ they tend to be very timid creatures. I'm glad you didn't freak out and hit him with a shovel!
What
That sounds delicious. My previous response was meant to be_comma_ "What's your favorite meal"_comma_ but I accidentally pressed enter.
did it show up on time?
waiting is the hardest part
what was it?
oh thats scary
I have always wanted one of those! They are very charming.
What is his name?
LOL! I love it! What a cute name. I might use that in the future.
Wow that sucks! What kind of diet is she on?
Dang_comma_ I've been thinking about dieting myself. Is it working out well for her?
Oh my thats good!  where did you loose it?
Oh my_comma_ Atleast he found it wow!
Are you nervous about it?
I am happy for you!
That's too bad. That sounds lonely.
I do too. Why were you alone?
Oh no!  That is not good.  What did you do?
I can imagine.  I would of done the same thing probably
Nice! What book were you reading?
Oh! I can't read very well tonight. Where did you book?
Really? I use fans as well! Most cities have a noise law for after 10..You can call and see? Poor dogs shouldn't be out late anyway
If they are neglected then there are chained dogs org that will help in many cities..Also if need be- Animal control..if not abusive..can help.
I hate that feeling!  Do you have that happen often?  I feel you. I've been losing sleep every night recently.  Are you in front of blue light computer screens or phones a lot? 
That drives me crazy too!  I can't get back to sleep once I wake up to go to the bathroom.  Hope you get some smooth zzzzz's tonight! 
i understand how you feel _comma_ my mom and dad love our older brother a lot and they do not even hide it hes the first born
just focus on yourself _comma_ and try and stay positive 
Oh my lord_comma_  Are you okay?
Thats good! She is lucky to have your support.
Oh boy_comma_ that's amazing! Congratulations_comma_ you certainly deserve it :)
That's great. Do you have any interview tips for me?
That's great!  I love it when something like that is completely under control.
Awesome!  I hope you got/get the job_comma_ and it goes well!
I don't blame you! Do you normally let him drive your car? Does he just take it without asking a lot?
I don't either. I would never take someone's car without asking. That is kind of a huge deal.
Schools are fun. I wish i could turn time back and go back to those good old days
Becoming adult is much worse to happen. School concerns as it appears now after realizing_comma_ were much more hassle free
hahah did it make you a little jelous you think?
hahahah yeah i can relate to that_comma_ my sister got an huge house for the same reason no kids not many bills jaja
did it work out or still waiting to hear back?
that good .. you should use (privacy dot com) for trials that require cc info in the future! it helps
That would be! However I am not a big fan of theme parks. I do like vacations though! Maybe you can go next year?
Oh great! Same place?
that is not good have you tried calling them to talk about the problem
YOu are right i think you shold just stop paying  if they treat you like that
Oh_comma_ that sucks. It has happened to me before too.
I'm sorry for how she treated you. Even if she couldn't refund the money_comma_ she could have been more polite. Maybe you could talk to someone else and try to download it again so that you at least have the software.
I wish she was nicer to you_comma_ but I'm glad that you got your money back.
Do you mean you feel bad that you don't get to go through bad things or that you don't get to be healed?
That stinks :(  I'm sorry it's so hard for you.
What sort of diet are you on?
Oh I'm on keto_comma_ I love it! What's the difference_comma_ do you know?
Yeah i really dont like most call centers they never talk to you in a happy manner they always give me an attitude
have you tried contacting the company about it?
Why what did they do to betray your trust?
I would be so mad I dislike when company's charge my card did you call to get a refund for the charge?
I would make a complaint and try contacting the BBB that is so unfair or even get your bank to dispute the charge. 
Oh_comma_ tell me about it_comma_ please!
Oh no! What happened next?
that is not good i am really sorry to hear that_comma_ is he o?
that is really nice to hear_comma_ hope everything goes as planned
Oh nice.  What movie did you see?
How was it? Did you like it?
Did something happen to you?
That's a good thing that it wasn't another type of drink!
uhoh_comma_ what happened? did someone hit you?
wow thats horrible! im sorry
Very true. Has this happened to you recently?
I am sorry to hear that. News like that can come out of nowhere.
Are you serious are you ok I am getting sick of these careless drivers.
That is smart glad you are fine I never thought about the dash cam wish I had one when I got in my crash get you one really soon.
Oh no im sorry to hear that .  Clear skys here
Thats a good thing now your very prepared for the worst
that is really cool_comma_ will you be giving a speech?
i mean it still pretty cool you won_comma_ congratulations
What kind of news did you get?
That is exciting!  But you are write - children are expensive!
That was very nice of them! Did you tell them you were thankful?
That is good to hear.
That sounds like fun_comma_ what band is playing.
I'm going on a guided fishing trip next month
What was it that gave you problems?
That was generous of him.  But continue to work on your punctuality.
Did they find out where the kid was at?
Maybe she skipped the school for the day?
Was it a lot of fun?
I'm glad you had a nice time...and they found the child by the way_comma_ it was an error.
I'm really happy that he made it. I bet it was a tough thing to go through.
I know what you mean. I wish my dad were still around.
Yea that wouldn't of turn out great.
Good to their safe.
That's nice that you have someone you can trust like that.
I'm glad for you on all of that.
Oh man_comma_ that sounds like a pain.
That's not good. You didn't get in trouble for that_comma_ did you?
Can you re-take the test?
Ouch that's bad.  Study hard. I'm sure youll do better next time
That sounds fun -but  be careful if there's rough weather!
I hope you catch a BIG ONE (or more) - have a great time!
How was it?
That does sound like a lot of fun
Is he better now ?
I hope he continues to improve. It's bad when a loved one is ill.
I bet that was nice
I am happy for you
yea that can be hard when things remind you of people
Sometimes you have to just look at the positives though and smile about it
At least you had a lot of fun
Well_comma_ they will get over it
what kind of project was it? It's always satisfying to see hard work pay off.
I'm sure you'll reap the rewards at your job in the long term.
ill try not to laugh_comma_ i promise.  Tell me about it!
ouch.  well i hope youre ok.
Did something happen to you?
Well that is just great. Congrats!
How is it going?
It happens like that. Don't give up.
I'm sorry. How long have you been together ?
Well_comma_ maybe it's for the best if you can move on.
Sounds like youre feeling pretty confident. I hope you get the promotion!
I think you will. Just keep doing a good job and keep your confidence up.
Yuck. At least it wasnt IN your house. That is gross.
I would be placing traps all inside my house in case it ever comes inside.
That must have brought back a lot of memories
good ones I hope.
That's great! I need to start saving money_comma_ myself.
Yeah it would be really nice to have some backup funds in case something happens.
poor dog _comma_ did he survive the impact ?
hopefully he survived the incident
Is it because you are there for him?
He would probably appreciate you doing that.
Oh no. What is wrong? 
That is such a pain. Do you have a credit card to use in the meantime? 
Vacations are the best.   Where are you going?
Ive heard a lot of good things about Austin_comma_ but ive never been.  Ive always wanted to go
Did you have any damage ?
I'm glad you came through it safely.
That has got to feel good!  Did you get a raise or a new job?
Congratulations!  Your life should feel a little less stressful when you get it!
Anticipation sucks. The hints don't help you figure it out?
HAHA that's a shame. It's just like having to stare at Christmas gifts for a month but not being able to open them as a kid.
These places should have them clean_comma_ because it is inevitably; these things happen
There are jobs that are hard
You must be so proud. Im sure she put in a lot of work to learn.
Wow_comma_ so talented. That must make you very happy to see them do well at something.
What concert is it ?
What a pleasant surprise.
That sounds like a great memory! I always get nostalgic about pretty much everything. How long ago was it?
I wish I had a group of friends like that. I always just knew people but never got close. 
So peaceful and relaxing right? What a beautiful sight. 
I would too if I could sit outside and enjoy it like you! 
Oh that's great. Is she going to  collge?
What does she want to do?
Oh I hate people like that.    People that flake out like that just have no respect for anyone elses' time.
That sucks. You should have went out anyways.
uhoh_comma_ I hope they dont have a late fee or anything attached to it
make sure you do it when you get home
sorry to hear that _comma_ try and keep busy or find a hobby eventually you will get over it_comma_ its just gonna take a bit of time
the gym is a great place to start _comma_ make new friends and get fit
Whoa. That is a big change. That must make you so happy.
Its probably muscle though so you will still look slimmer.
That's great when you have good maintence for a place.
That's such a waste of money and food. Glad its working out though.
awesome! congratulation.  So you are enjoying the job now?
Keep doing what youre doing!  I think youll keep moving up that company ladder in no time
I have felt that. It always sucks feeling like you can
That's the worst. How do they expect people to get around?
Like ever before.
I'm well mostly_comma_ but ready for Fall to come.
and what happened next?
why? He did not do anything bad to you.
Wow I would say the same! Accidents happen but come on pick them up. Im sorry! 
It really is unreal_comma_ but you know people are getting worse and worse these days_comma_. 
Wow how unappreciative they sound. You will be better off at your next job I am sure.
Im sure your next employer will be much better. That is no way to treat an employee.
I bet.  It can be intimidating to start a new regime.
I should start back to working out.  The older I get_comma_ the harder it seems to begin.  Do you have any advice?
Lol_comma_ that would be awesome to get some free childcare.  My kids tend to drive me nuts at times.
Yes_comma_ thank God that summer is finally over!
How long ago has this been?
It never gets too far out of your memory. but it will fade over time. I doubt you'll still be feeling like this when you're in the nursing home.
Does that happen often?
And that usually knocks out the power?
Very cool of you to take a stand on something you believe in.
Oh wow. That has to be hard to see. It's great they you are actually doing something about it.
$100! I have never won that much!
I wouldnt even know what to do with an extra $100
How did that end? 
Well we give in to our friends. Hopefully he pays you back and not ruin your friendship.
Wow thats a long time to work together did yall meet at work? 
Thats sad. Im so sorry to hear that! 
I know what you mean
There are other girls
Thats awesome that you have saved all of that.  I bet its heartwarming to look back at all of that stuff
You should get some good storage totes and pack it all up so its safe
I know how you feel. One small decision could make everything nowadays different for you.
If you wonder how things would be different you'd drive yourself nuts.
Did you see any ghosts?
I've been to one of those. They sure find ways to get you!
what are you being tested for?
Well I hope you are okay? Did the doctor hint at anything?
Oh yeah is it nice? 
I know it sucks when people get what you need and its out of sight but I hope you get one soon! 
that's great! I bet you are very proud of them!
you're not! :) I'm sure they will go to college and end up being very successfull
Congrats! When are you going?
That sounds really exciting. Are you taking someone along?
Congradulations. Is this your first time moving in with a boyfriend? 
What are you worried about?
I think I would be mad_comma_ too.
This chat has three people in it_comma_ it seems.  I am talking to two separate Worker_2's.
ah thats sad. You must have look forwarded to the trip
There's always a next time.
I'm so sorry! It's always sad losing a friend. 
I remember losing my childhood dog. They always stay in your hear.
It has been really dry here_comma_ as well.  We are in a severe drought for the third time in four years.
5
That sounds like a lot of fun! Where are you headed to? 
I am a sucker for some good deals! 
Did you find a new job or retire?
Congratulations I hope you like it
her loss :) i'm glad you didn't get too stressed about therejection
it is. i remember all the drama from my teen years and how i was stressed and crying over really stupid stuff :) 
I've never seen that movie_comma_ why is it depressing?
Oh wow_comma_ that is very depressing. I hate movies like that.
now thats more depressing _comma_ cheer up you eventually find better friends 
not every person in the world is the same _comma_ we are all different  i am confident you will find someone 
Congratulations!  Are you going to celebrate?
Why does it take so long to kick in?
That's too bad. Is she feeling better today?
I hope she feels better. That's never fun for mom or child.
Were you able to find out what it was?
Be safe_comma_ they may come back.
Were you expecting them?
What a surprise! I love when friends go above and beyond like that_comma_ it shows that they really care
I know I hear you... maybe one day we will win the lotto. 
Well I hope one day you get what you want :) 
Did you have some good food?
That is awesome!
What happened today? :)
Thats great! What will you guys do together?
Being helpless when waiting for things is the worst feeling. There's nothing you can do but you need to do something!
yikes_comma_ that sucks. Hopefully you found one that worked eventually.
Your an outstanding mate and great friend_comma_ she must have had a hard time my child hood friend died in a car crash and i felt dead inside for a long time
yes i still have dreams of my friend _comma_ and he passed 12 years ago _comma_ i will never forget him
Thats so sad! Im really sorry. :( Have you been researching about it? 
I cant even begin to imagine how hard that must be. Stay strong! 
Did she break anything ? How old is she ?
Hopefully no breaks.
I agree_comma_ it is good to have something to look forward to. 
I completely agree
What happened?
But did you even hesitate and think about it?
That's good to hear.  Is there any chance of promotion in the future.
Are they hiring? I could use a new job. 
That is annoying. I wish public transportation was better in the city.
Maybe see if you can do your grocery shopping to. Maybe that will save you from having to do it later in the week.
What was it ? I'm a music lover.
That is one of the tunes that is on the gold record flying out of our solar system on the Voyager probe.
Thats terrible to hear... :( When did you find that out? 
Ugh I dont even know how to respond to that other than to tell you to hang in there. Lots of positive and love your way. 
What sorts of places have you been going? Alone time is always great but then sometimes it gets to be too much so I understand.
You could always do that but maybe exploring on your own can give you a different perspective on things.
Have you tried sharing it to your friends on social media?
Just keep cranking them out. YOur videos will get better and your channel will grow. I know it can be annoying at first.
How do you think you did?
I think you'll do just fine.   Do you still have to take the BAR exam after?
Congrats! That is so cool!
That is really something to be proud of!
That does sound like fun!  What is the came called?
That sounds amazing!  You all must have really enjoyed playing it!
Are you on wireless_comma_ or a wired network?
Wow_comma_ that sounds terrible. I really do hope you fix your internet problem.
Congratulations. I bet you cant wait.
You are gonna do great. Enjoy your time before you start work.
Ugh I would be bummed too. Dont give up tho! 
I know_comma_ but you will have so many more summers coming up you got this 
Wow.  Have you studied for them?
That is great!  What classes are they in?
Just enjoy as much time as you can with them _comma_ losing loved ones is never easy
thats sad to hear 
That's fantastic. How old are you?
Keep up the good work.
oh no_comma_ why do you think like that.. All should be good
ah ok. If intuition tells not to fly. Lets not take chance. you should skip the flight
I'm sure you did great_comma_ do you have doubts that you didn't?
It sucks having to wait for something like that_comma_ I know_comma_ but it will be here soon enough. Try to relax.
that must be pretty frustrating
maybe you should have a talk with her
Oh really? What did they do?
Wow! That was really nice of them.
How did you hurt it?
That really sucks_comma_ I hope you feel better and can take her another day!
that is ridiculous! that's annoying when people don't clean up after their dogs! I love going to the local park with my son and there is dog poop in the grassy areas
It is_comma_ plus it's so antisanitary
You should've called the police if they didn't listen to you
It sucks that you were forced to
Has it been a long time? 
Oh whoa. That is pretty crazy. Hopefully yall can become friends again.
I would have been feeling the same way too. Oh well maybe she thought it was cute. 
No way! Come on. You are a champ walk back in there. 
That is great_comma_ do they enjoy it?
That is awesome_comma_ I am sure it makes you happy
Oh no. I bet he felt really bad about it.
Is it repairable at all?
Congrats! How is it going?
That's great_comma_ I'm glad you are transitioning to something new so well.
That's great_comma_ how did you repay her?
That would be a nice gesture
a surprise party that is awesome - did you have fun ?
im really happy for you 
Well thats part of being in the workforce_comma_ work when everyone is looking_comma_ hang out when they are not. Most people arent paid enough to care
Sounds a bit harsh_comma_ but business is business
I could imagine. Its a big day you both waited so long for.
Im sure once it was over you realized that you would be okay with that.
Old memories are the best. Do you plan to go back again soon?
That sounds good_comma_ hope you have a great time
Thats so impressive! You must be proud. 
I would be too. Thats amazing. Good for her! 
Awesome_comma_ You saved yourself a ton of money by doing that!
Yeah I could not imagine life without the internet
im sure that you will find another soon
im sorry_comma_ i read that wrong. i am very happy for you!
What was that?
Yuck! I don't think I'd be able to hold back my own puke if that happened to me.
I know what you mean.  Theres some crazy stuff out there about it too!
The Berenstein bears one i think is crazy
What was it that happened to you?
They are hungry little beast.
Where are you getting lunch?
That sounds fun! Are you going with anyone?
im sorry that is awful
eventually you will feel better again
I bet that will go in the record books. How old is she? 
Thats amazing. You must be proud. Good for her! 
What's it all about?
Sounds like she just needs some time to settle in_comma_ and catch her breath.
Congratulations! thats awesome.  Does he know what hes going for?
Wow_comma_ so he must be really smart then.  Make sure he doesnt do too much partying like I did.
What happened?
That is so awesome_comma_ you must  be so proud!
That's so sweet. How did that make you feel?
Yes! We will be planning a second birthday soon! I cant wait!
Who are you talking about?
Oh awesome_comma_ yes childbirth is an amazing feeling
thats awesome i bet you were very thankful
thats what family is for
That's awesome! I bet you're really proud of her.
I really hope that you continue to encourage her! She may have a future as an artist.
What was that secret? 
All the best for your exams!
You need to take care of the elderly_comma_ I am sure she has cared for you your whole life
Have you talked to her about this ?
Then use her yard as a garbage can. That's what she does to yours.
I am sure it does. What kind of truck is it? 
sounds super cool! 
Hey! Yes_comma_ I do actually especially when it's nice out.
I carry it in my nalgene wide mouth water bottle. What about you?
Is she far away from you now?
Oh_comma_ can you go across there and visit her?
Oh yeah what was that? 
That is super sweet of them! So nice. 
That was not very nice of him. Did your parents react well?
What a mean thing to do.
Yeah_comma_ I'm taking care of her for the last few months. 
yeah i should
Could you help her out once in awhile?
Well that is really considerate!
Haha_comma_ you could have played it off as cute and clumsy and maybe they would have been into it
Yea thats a good idea.  Be like_comma_ hopefully I dont spill this one on me too
What do you have coming up? Ill keep you in mind.
Just have confidence. It sounds like you already know the outcome. If she says no just dont make a big deal out it.
What was it that you did to feel so courageous?? 
That is well worth taking a chance on since the risk of rejection did not happen and the payoff was a good outcome. She said yes! 
ha ha ha thats a good one tho! Your parents tho omg. Thats funny but I am sure it wasnt in the moment. 
I know I would have been super upset in the moment. 
Was everything okay? Did it take long for the power to come back?
That is scary! I hope nothing came inside
Are you pretty bad with math?
Well maybe you will get a good overall grade and pass!
Is it a hurricane or something worse?
Oh no_comma_ stay indoors for sure!
That's awesome! What kind of car is it?
Yeah_comma_ I'm jealous. You're so lucky!
I know it was terrible. Are you from vegas? 
ugh well i hope no one in your family was affected 
That is great I am so happy for you_comma_ what industry are you in?
Thats all that matters_comma_ and your happiness 
Oh my God_comma_ that's terrible.
Well_comma_ I will pray for you_comma_ and I hope our advanced medicine and doctors can cure him.
Keep your head up and ask around if anyone has oppurtunites for you
It will get better_comma_ its always darkest just before the dawn
That happens sometimes.  How did you end up doing in the end?
Don't sweat it.  There's plenty of other competitions that you can try again at.
Yeah_comma_ It's priceless moment. Being a mother_comma_ I can understand your feelings.
Each birth is special irrelevant of first or second. I am happy for you though
What are you doing now?
That is awesome_comma_ good for you!
Are you serious
Does he still have your car
YEs it does_comma_ take advantage of the time you have now
Reach out to them and see how they are!
Thats awesome. I love getting money as a gift.  Then you get to spend it how you want
Paying off debt is where i am now.  its hard work_comma_ but so worth it
thats awesome i cant wait to have kids!
i bet!
Oh no_comma_ did you see who did it?
Darn_comma_ I hope your insurance covers it
That's unfortunate. What made you so scared of it?
There were no lights in the basement?
I'm proud of you! I attend both Sunday and Wednesday nights each week
God is always there for you and always will be. 
Are you going to keep her?
Is she a brown doggy?
That's great! What kind of project is it?
Making money's always good! Do you think it'll be a success?
it is frustrating to watch i agre
that is unfortunate_comma_ hopefully you can give them guidance
were they your children?
I would be too. I would have complained to staff.
What kind do you have at the moment
Nice I love German Shephards! They are cute when puppies and monsters when they grow up_comma_ my kind of dog
Good for you_comma_ as an added bonus you are saving more money!
Cigarettes are very expensive depending on where you live
At least you finally got one! Sometimes it helps not to focus too much on what everyone has has or has done.
I get it_comma_ everyone wants their first kiss like yesterday! It's a big moment!
Oh no_comma_ do you have a digital backup?
Its ok_comma_ you can always make new memories_comma_ it will not replace what you have lost_comma_ but it is a start
That's pretty messed up. Why did you do that?
Are you going to tell her?
That is awesome_comma_ what will you spend it on?
Good for you_comma_ make sure you get the 20% down.
There is no "right place" to be for everyone. Each person has their own individual path
I think that we are free to do as we want and we are in control of our fate.
Oh really_comma_ what happened?
Oh wow_comma_ you must've been pretty tired to make a mistake like that.
i have never seen it
i will check it out then!
Aw_comma_ I really sorry to hear that. Is is serious?
I'm sorry_comma_ At least you can rest assured knowing that your cat lived a long life.
That really sucks that that happened to you. Maybe start by putting small amounts of trust in people
Ha_comma_ sometimes the only person you can trust is yourself.
Nice what kind of project was it
That's aweseome. I'm happy it turned out well. You must be pretty artistic
That is the best feeling! I love getting a good deal on a great product.
Sounds like it was a nice surprise :)
I know how you feel! I'm about to be 30 and i feel so old lol
that's really great! you are such an optimist_comma_ i need to learn from you :)
What were they being eliminated from?
Were the singers any good?
waht type of game is x game?
ok _comma_so was it fun?
I'm glad you had a nice trip. Was it your first.
I would have thought it would be the other way around.
Oh no! Did she miss school?
Well good thing she got there! Kids always tend to want to go to bed at the last minute and end up not sleeping enough or sleeping past their alarms!
Oh man_comma_ Fight Club is a great movie! I just recently saw it myself and was really surprised too.
I agree_comma_ that movie is definitely ahead of it's time!
That's cool.  Where at
That's aweseome I've always wanted to go to Cali...from the Midwest_comma_ moved to TX to escape the desolate tundra haha
Do you like Mexican style foods?
Oh did you tell your boyfriend about it?
What kind are you looking for? I don't know about you_comma_ but I hate car shopping!
I understand that. Gas is so expensive!
Oh where are you going? Is it a long trip?
Make a list and start packing for it a couple days in advance! 
oh no_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
That's horrible. I am sorry for your loss. 
Did you help him to learn the swim techniques?
How old is your son now?
That's pretty awesome...were you happy to see one or were you nervous
Oh man he must have been huge...did you get any pictures
Oh wow_comma_ that's amazing! I workout as well.
I actually injured my back a while back as well. I haven't gone to the doctor yet_comma_ though!
Oh no_comma_ I'm sorry for your loss. Cats are such nice companions.
Yes_comma_ time will help get over those feelings. Do you plan to get another one?
Oh man I know how you feel. How old was your bird?
That is horrible. Take some time and grieve. Im always here if you need someone to talk to.
That is awesome!  DO yo have to pay for Headstart?
That's great.  My daughter is 3_comma_ so I hope I can get her into a program like that!
That's cool. We saw it when it came out.
It was exciting.
What type of job do you have now?
Oh that is nice. Do you have a website for your business?
And what news would that be
best of luck friend
Oh wow! That would be so scary! What happened?
How far from shore were you?
That's awesome_comma_ congrats! Do you have a job lined up for when you finish?
Yes_comma_ it will be nice to have a good pay cheque coming in.
Wow_comma_ that's a pretty cool hobby. Just a small plane?
Yeah I always thought it would be fun to learn to do that. 
Haha_comma_ I've seen plenty do wheelies. I've seen a few crash too_comma_ sadly
That takes a lot of nerve_comma_ so kudos to that guy. I'd never do that because I'd probably die lol
That's great!  Don't be too nervous!  Your date is most likely just as nervous as you are!
Just try to have a fun time and let what happens_comma_ happen!
Yeah they're great. Super light and rigid.  They feel kind of springy when you ride them
Do you have clipless pedals on it?
Absolutely. It doesn't help that I'm pretty introverted.
I hate when you help someone out and they take advantage of you. I could never do that to someone.
Why do you feel bad? It is a tough decision for sure_comma_ but you should never have to feel bad about it.
I hear you on that_comma_ but the way it is right now_comma_ everything we do is destroying the environment_comma_ and I'm sure you do plenty already to help. Until electric vehicles are more affordable and reliable_comma_ you can't blame yourself for the choice. I'm sure your words have affected others and made them rethink their choices_comma_ and all that helps and adds up.
Blessing are another reason to be grateful! 
How long were you married?
That's really generous of her.  She'll grow up to have pretty good karma 
Yes.  I once helped out a friend in a car wreck.  A month later I got a flat tire changed for free
Oh man! That's some Jerry Springer level drama. What happened? Did you tell him/
Are they going to break up?
Oh man_comma_ that must have been humiliating! Did people notice?
Oh_comma_ man! I'm sorry to hear that. Gotta be careful next time!
Congrats! How did you do it_comma_ and where do you work?
My mom worked at a bank_comma_ and it's not as easy as you'd think it'd be_comma_ that's for sure. Congratulations again!
Everything is harder until we do it. And am proud of you for donating blood. It is one of the good habit of this human race i would say.
yeah am B+_comma_ O+ is quite common and it can match for other blood group and O-ve is the opposite
You met Johnny Dep? I have no idea_comma_ what happened?
Wow_comma_ that's pretty cool! Congrats! That's a pretty exciting new thing in your life.
Do you think they just didn't want to pay for your retirement?
Are you a part of the union?
Wow that's cool...with hers or your credit card..?
Then she's a keeper for sure
Sounce like you're a bit of an introvert.
Yeah_comma_ That gets old after a whle for me.    
Well that's awful. Did you ask him why he didn't pick you?
Yes_comma_ I hope so too. it's nice to get promotions at work.
You must be so happy! What kind of car?
Oh hell yeah! I bet you're so thankful to your parents. Enjoy your new car!
Oh that's cool.  Glad it worked out for her
Boy or girl?
That's impressive but_comma_ 45 mags are rare. are you sure it wasn't a 44 magnum?
Interesting.  It is a real bullet. 
Oh no! What happened?
Oh that is nasty! What did you do?
Congrats_comma_ is your son very old or young?
Is he a sports player for the scholarships?
Holy crap! Did you see what it was?
Oh wow. Should have taken pictures of it and used the internet to help you figure out what it was! I'd be curious.
Oh no_comma_ did you get hurt very badly?
I hope both our ego and your nose heal up quickly!
I'm sorry. That must be difficult. I am glad you have pictures to hold on to though.
That's too bad you couldn't go_comma_ but memories are great to have!
Oh nice! Hope you get it
Best of luck!
that is absolutely amazing! I'm so proud of you! You should be very proud of yourself as well
I'm a stay at home mom and honestly it's the hardest job i've ever had but the most rewarding one :) I told my husband i want to keep having kids so i won't have to work again lol
Was there a big name event going on? I've seen the Blue Angles live 
/oh no_comma_ what happened_comma_ whats the problem with the provider
Bad customer service. You should definitely switch
Sometimes that happens when you take a break from something for too long_comma_ but with some practice you might be able to pick it back up again
if they are really your friends_comma_ they wont care if you were bad
Absolutely! I've always noticed that phenomena. If you act too desperate it actually puts them off. On the contrary_comma_ acting a little disinterested gets THEM more interested.
I can agree with that. Women like a man who is dedicated to something. It shows good characer.
That's cool.  I'll have to try those out sometime
Nice does it go well with any dip? Or is it better alone
Its always a great time when that happens.  My best friend and I moved away so I hadly ever see them now
It is_comma_ it makes all those memories just flood back
Oh yes! Deja Vu has happened to me quite a bit! It's eerie and cool huh?
It's always intense running into ex's. I'm glad your guys conversation went well and you guys could catch up. 
He probably passed the infection to his mouth! Gross!
He needs to be quarantined whenever he gets some kind of sickness_comma_ lol.
Oh awesome! That's crazy_comma_ because my 30th birthday is next week_comma_ lol. What makes you excited? Because I'm dreading mine.
Hahaha_comma_ I guess that's true. For me it's pretty bad. I don't know if you're familiar with the internet term_comma_ but on my 30th birthday_comma_ I'm going to be a "wizard" lol.
I've always wanted one of those! I hope you enjoy it.
I've tried some of the cheaper virtual reality headsets_comma_ but I'm sure they can't compare at all!
That would make me so mad!  What did you do?
You should!  No one should have to clean up after someone elses animal.
Im glad you made changes for the positive in your life.  You cant go back into the past_comma_ but you can keep moving forward
What kind of changes have you made and why did you decide to make them?
Why do you think you'll get fired
Do you plan on discussing this with your boss? 
That would be so scary! Did it work on the first try?
I can't imagine. Are you planning on going parachuting again? 
Oh sweet_comma_ I can't even  imagine the excitement you must have. I hope everything works out for you!
We need more musicians who are about the music and bringing enlightenment to people. We got way too much commercial garbage on the radio. I really hope your message resonates with people.
More than a couple of times.
That's not bad at all.  
I would never go to that place again. Did you go to a different place?
that's horrible! I'm sorry to hear that. if i was you i would write a bad review on this restaurant's facebook page
i get you. i hate fighting but i'm not going to be disrespected either.
i totally understand that.
Hm I can relate to that haha
I'm not always broke but I feel like what helps is leaving my credit / debit card at home and just carry cash for what I need
That must have been really annoying. Sucks to be a person who's on time dealing with people who don't care about being on time themselves.
Did you say anything after they arrived?
As long as it takes you from A to B and safe to drive that's all that matters:) I used to have 1995 camry and it looked old and beat up but it was the best car i've had
i feel like those type of cars are the most reliable! 
She spend all  youre retirement money? That's pretty messed up.  Why did she do that?
Are you going to divorce her?
Are you going to the police?
Sounds like a plan.
Oh I hope you can find an alternative
Sounds like you'll be alright after all
At least it's better than having nothing to use
I'm sorry. How long had you been together?
I hope you feel better soon.
oh no_comma_ is she on computer too much?
you got a fair point. You would need to soften her with something else other wise children's will keep aggravate you 
Ooh_comma_ awesome! I bet everyone's excited! I hope the future holds many more wonderful things for you!
Yea_comma_ some people really prove that hard work can pay off. I hope he enjoys the promotion!
Have you gone on dates before?
It could be that but some of my friends have said that with social media and online dating_comma_ it's harder and harder to truly connect with someone. There are a lot of people out there struggling.
I still think you made the right choice by going.
True.. but_comma_ who knows... maybe you'll make a new friend.
I am so sorry. That is heartbreaking.
Itll take some time to grieve. Just make sure you have close friends and family nearby to talk to.
Whoa_comma_ did it stink? Was it roadkill?
Haha_comma_ man_comma_ I bet that was fun. Poor skunk didn't know what hit him.
what is making you have second thoughts?
there are other options in life but you must always follow your heart when making such important decisions.
As we say around here_comma_ you ain't lying! How long were you waiting?
We have all been there! How hard would it be to put a few extra pens out? They gotta be worth like what_comma_ a couple pennies a pop?
Wow! Did you thank your mom or buy her any gifts on your trip?
Dang! Can I get a hug too? 
Wow_comma_ I bet that was nostalgic. How'd it feel seeing your old self doing fun stuff?
Haha_comma_ yea_comma_ although some people I know haven't changed at all. I just miss the energy I had from when I was younger.
That's great. You must be excited.    Have you played all the smash bros games?
That's pretty cool. I've never played it before_comma_ What genre is it?
That sounds fun I might have to check it out.  It sounds pretty nostalgic.
I won't have a switch but_comma_ I think that may be worth checking out.
I understand where you are coming from. Can you blame her for window shopping though?
Honestly_comma_ we all do it. Plus_comma_ who cares if she checks out other guys if she is coming home with you!
That's awesome. you must be excited.  I've been to cancun but not cozumel.
You're not worried about the bad booze or kidnappings?
I would hate to live by myself. I have been married 21 years and have 6 kids and 7 grandkids. I don't know what it's like to be alone.
Yeah_comma_ my kids are almost all grown. I don't know what I will do when they are all gone. I guess I will just enjoy the grandkids and my husband. It will be different.
Oh gosh! That's terrible. I stayed in a house with a rat problem for a while_comma_ it was not fun. What're you going to do about them?
Woooow_comma_ haha. Time for a game plan! I hope you can get rid of them_comma_ you may need to call up some friends or an exterminator.
Yes all the time! That sounds like a nice dream. Do you still have a close relationship with your family?
Oh no_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can repair and issues you have between you guys. There's nothing more important than family.
Oh my gosh that's terrifying! What kind of snake was it? And what did you do?
That's awesome! I am truly impressed with your handling of the situation.
I have 3_comma_ do you have any
I don't think I could work in a daycare. It would be overwhelming.
Some people are just better at working with kids.
I like kids but I wouldn't want to work with them all day.
That is the worst. 
lol. All men do for that matter
You and me both. 
Wow_comma_ what a surprise!
Oh why is that?
it is indeed_comma_ learning things at young age is a boon. you got an exceptional daughter
haha!! you are i guess!!
oh no. did you try to retrace your steps to find it?
oh that stinks. did you have phone insurance at least?
i'm so sorry. hopefully there is something they can do for you
it's worth it so you don't have to be without a phone.
I know where this is going lol
So it wasn't a kitten?
What was it?
There were some burds fighting under my car once and I thought it was cats.
That sounds like fun! It's great to spend time with our children. Did you have fun?
Oh yes_comma_ they can do that when they get older. My daughter is a teenager now_comma_ so I can relate!
I bet it was! I have two kids but they're pretty young. I'm looking forward to seeing them achieve the same thing.
My son is going to the fourth grade and has been doing great so far. I hope he can keep it up!
oh man_comma_ that is the worst! all that hard work_comma_ ruined
i love eggs and cheese and would have been heartbroken. good thing pizza was available
I have never heard of that
oh cool. I never been to any kind of motorcycle event
I bet.  What grades are they in?
Are you excited for them?
That's really frustrating. What band was it a t-shirt for?
Oh_comma_ I bet I could guess what kind of music they'd play. Sorry about your shirt problem_comma_ though.
i used to go fishing with my grandpa a lot as a kid_comma_ brings back awesome memories
i feel the exact same way. i haven't fished in years for that same reason
That's a good feeling
How many kids do you want?
Oh dang! Did you file for classes late?
I'm so sorry to hear it! Were you able to take anything?
That's my favorite part of facebook!  Especially when I see old pics of my kids.
About this time of year_comma_ there's a lot of 'first day of school' pics.
And in between football games and soccer games_comma_ and christmases - it's a healthy reminder that time flies so quickly!
I know Google Photos has a little reminder thingy where it says something like_comma_ "Remember this day?"
Oh that is awesome! Im sure you do! Waiting for that can really feel like forever when its only been a few minutes!
Its good that you are excited! Im sure you will be a great asset for them!
Haha!  I am only laughing because I know exactly what you are talking about!  That has happened to me a couple times!.  I had to use a hand towel once!
Ha!  I wasn't thinking at the time.  I was just grabbing whatever was around!
Why's that?
Did you go with anyone?
Thats good! Relationships aren't for everyone all the time. You have to love yourself before you can love someone else right?
Yes_comma_ and you will end up meeting someone when youre not looking and n ot expecting it. 
Thats no good
i know that feelingh
That's good. Your interview must have went really well.
Well I hope you get it then.
thats good.its very important to instill good learning and study habbits. something i wish i had as kid
sounds like she is ready to succeed 
That is good to hear. I am glad you did not overspend and go into debt.
I hope you can find another job soon.
I love self gifts. what was it
Thats pretty cool
Really?Is it a good show? I've never heard of it. 
I'm the same way! Although now that I know it is scary I probably won't watch it!
I do sometimes too
I have seen things like that from people in my own city. It kind of messed up
Uh oh_comma_ hopefully there is something you can do about that! 
I would do the same! I'll pray for you! 
I have never gotten a ticket lol
Let me knock on wood right now!
A lot of people are.  Money sense does not come natural to all people.
Ouch!  That has got to hurt!  Are you really mad?
That is kinda cool though right? Some people_comma_ like my mom_comma_ could not wait to get us out
I get that_comma_ what do you usually do when they are gone?
Paid lunches? like a cafeteria?
Oh ok. I've only had one job like that. 
Why is that? Did you have a bad experience as a kid?
That makes sense_comma_ kids can be really mean to younger kids_comma_ sorry that happened to you!
You should do it. 
You can if you believe in yourself. but you will never know unless you try
You will be really happy when you get paid
That makes sense I guess
Did that happen intentionally?
Good_comma_ just make sure to do what you have to still!
What causes you to think that way?
*nods_comma_ understanding*  I remember that feeling with my oldest.  She hadn't been around too many other people besides her dad_comma_ me_comma_ and a cousin or two.  There was an open house at the school she was going to and all of us went to meet her teacher and get a feel for her classroom.  Is there something similar at your son's school?
Hmmm...I think once he gets a feel for things and engages in activities and just busies himself he might be okay with it.  Just reassure him that you'll be back at the end of the day_comma_ and that you can do something special at home when he's done with school.
Just reassure him a lot because if he knows you're there for him at the very start of his school career_comma_ everything after this will be a walk in the park.  :)
I think I remember that movie
YES. I didn't see it lol
Have you complained?
That sounds rough_comma_ sorry to hear about that!
Dr MArio is that game for me
yep. I ca't get my kids into things like that. My daughter like minecraft
How do you feel about that?
Do you feel that 6 months is too fast?
i hope she is worthy of that trust
i feel the same about my husband but you hear so many horror stories you can't help but be a little weary
Did you call him right back?
That makes sense_comma_ was it an important phone call?
Why do you not like it anymore?
Oh_comma_ that is no fun_comma_ but at least you have the memories!
I played that a long time ago
I will. I should be playing the COD beta but I have other things to do
Oh no there terrible twos! I wish you the best! 
It'll be well worth it when you can laugh with him over the things he did! 
How did that go?
Oh no_comma_ did someobody see you indecent?? That is not good!
You sure do. You sound under appreciated
You deserve better. Find something before you leave though
That sounds nice_comma_ what did you do?
Oh_comma_ did something happen?
I hate when that happens
I know. You don't get that much further ahead of someone doing that
Does it run well still?
Oh_comma_ maybe it is worth something to a collector!
Oh I am sorry to hear that. Who put you on the spot like that?
Wow. Did he/she have it in for ya?
I do the same. I kept all of the first outfits for holidays_comma_ too!
Nope_comma_ I kept everything!
That's so awesome. Did you cry?
I wish I had a surprise arty thrwn for me. I would probably pass out lol
Oh no I'm sorry to hear that.
Right_comma_ there's always a next time. Don't let it discourage you too much.
That was so nice! Did you enjoy it?
I bet it made your whole day different!
Thats pretty sweet
What kind of cake?
That sounds about right. How old is she?
At 13 everything is interesting to her. She may just want attention.
I just got in a few months ago_comma_ best of luck my friend!
I am in the Information Systems field
Yes! My husband and I bought the old school Nintendo and played a couple of months back.
They are_comma_ I really enjoyed playing them. We also played Donkey Kong.
Why is that making you sad?
That is true_comma_ well there is a lot of time left
I love playing Mario!
I haven't played that one_comma_ I will have to try it out.
That's nice of you. Is it a special occasion?
Use a recipe and stick to it. If he is a good boyfriend he will appreciate your effort.
Oh my word! I wouls have just died
Where did it go?
That's sweet! Family is so important and relationships with siblings is a very significant one in our lives. I felt the same about my sister.
We weren't_comma_ only 2 1/2 years. It was just the two of us and we were very close_comma_ she passed away several years ago.
I do_comma_ I used to play growing up.
I will have to try it out!
What field is that for? I am sure that is a lot of stress
That makes sense_comma_ well I wish you the best of luck!
Well_comma_ you can't do everything.
Give yourself a break. Your financial health is important too.
That is smart_comma_ money is tight these days
That can be tough to do_comma_ but will pay off in the long run!
Everyone has bad bosses. Just keep working hard and they will have to recognize your greatness.
Then maybe you should think about trying to find a job somewhere else?
What did you get?
Seriously? Do you like super smash bros? It is coming out in december_comma_ I love my switch to death man_comma_ it is amazing
I have been there_comma_ I hope everything works out for you!
Thank goodness_comma_ that will make you stressed.
Oh that is nice! What happened at the party?
Oh that's nice! Enjoy summer while it lasts. What did you go to college for?
Yeah that was awesome! I feel like they have a less than stellar track record when it comes to fan service.
I get where you are coming from. Nintendo fans are not easy to please!
I love the fair! Did you have a good time?
That sounds like a great time!
What is your field ?
We need you. Hang in there.
What are they for?
Ah okay_comma_ that is good then_comma_ I hope they are effective for you!
Oh_comma_ most jobs don't unfortunately
That's very unusual. Most jobs don't. I would talk to the managers about it! Paid lunch would be great
Well_comma_ maybe the time in bed will help you relax
That must be quite dissapointing
That sounds really exciting? what was it?
Congratulations.  Thats awesome.  I hope you give him the world
I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ growing up can be tough.
That is hard_comma_ especially being so far away from family.
That's wonderful. I have two daughters 10 and 13. I wish you the best.
You'll do fine. As long as you love him_comma_ everything else will work out.
I haven't heard about the "direct" yet. What about it do you like?
That sounds exciting! I can't wait to what they come up with next!
I know that feeling.  I do phone support too.
Yep_comma_ but you can only help one person at a time.
Why is that?
Oh_comma_ that would not have been fun! They do not like people!
That's terrible. 
Are you going to say anything to your surperiors.
Why is that?
Oh_comma_ well they probably do not need any ice cream!
Haha_comma_ they can eat ice cream when they are the parents!
Aw he's still a little guy.
Cherish the moment while you can!
Oh no_comma_ I hate to heart that. I hope everything is okay.
Something big must have happened.
Oh no_comma_ did something happen to have caused it?
I'm sorry to hear about what happened. Are you staying with your wife?
That is bad. What are you planning to do instead?
That is good also. Hanging out with friends is the best thing to do.
That's great! I must have been so cool to see that!
That's really great!
No way_comma_ that is the worst. Did you ask your roommate why he or she ate it?
I am sorry to hear that! 
Is that the first day ?
That's nice. Mine started a couple of weeks ago.
That's a good thing. It can sometimes be overwhelming though
I know what you mean. We are getting club schedules together for my teen
You are very fortunate. Have you decided on a name yet?
You will know when the time is right. I am adopted myself_comma_ so I have a special place in my heart for new parents.
That sounds fun!
Did you get a lot of gifts too?
Children are angels!
Yes_comma_ that happens everytime!
Those games are usually so fun.
I will do that.
Congrats_comma_ how fast did it go by?
Ugh I was hoping that is not the case_comma_ I would want my kid to be young forever
I had to work when I turned 21. That must have been awesome
I went to the casino after and won 250 dollars but I was by myself lol
How do you feel about that?
Sorry to hear that_comma_ i hope you get chances to visit!
I enjoy football_comma_ but I mainly enjoy that when football happens_comma_ fall comes.
What do you do for work?
I am so thankful that I am able to stay home with my child.
It really is!
Why is that?
I am glad it did not make you depressed!
Me too.
I am sorry to hear that_comma_ I have been there before.
I think so_comma_ that's the giant shark movie_comma_ right ?
I've never been much for sea stuff for some reason.
no_comma_ it's just not my thing. I like sci fi and horror...just not sea stuff
I know exactly what you mean
I hate that too. Especially when you are paying and they are right behind you... like_comma_ why?
Does he at least work hard for it ?
Hopefully he  has worked hard for it. I'm sorry you have to deal with that
I can imagine. 
You have a lot of hard work ahead.
That's awesome. What kind of car.
That is a nice car! 
I am so sorry to hear that. I am glad you found people to count on.
I am happy for you
Me neither_comma_ how do you feel about it?
me too_comma_ best of luck!
That's really sweet. Is there any member of your family you are particularly close with?
Siblings can be our closest confidants_comma_ and in a lot of cases_comma_ lifelong friends.
do you like being home alone much?
yeah i can relate to that_comma_ alone time is sometimes very relaxing
I bet. That is a special moment
What did you name him?
That's so cute. I have a son named Ethan
That sounds fun_comma_ did she have a good time?
That is even better! School shopping can be so expensive.
Uh oh_comma_ are you ready for the "Terrible 2's"?
He will be into everything. I know what you mean about looking back. Kids grow so fast.
Oh no_comma_ I am so sorry! I hope you find him.
I'm sure he will return!
That's cool.
I was told that recently. My ilfe revolves around my kids
I know exactly whaat you're saying
Well that's fun!  Did he do a good job?
Cool I'm glad it was a success.  I hope it reminded you of good times!
did you like that? i find reusing dresses very combinient
that is really nice_comma_ i still have my wedding dress
That's so nice!
Hey children are a miricle. 
That's nice. What sort of work do you do?
Great_comma_ how about a loan ? Just kidding.
wow_comma_ it sounds like a very exotic holiday
Ok_comma_ but at least you got to do something you have always wanted right? visit gulf shores
I hate how itchy you get after being bitten.
The bites take forever to go away_comma_ too!
It's a difficult fact of life
I think that's normal! Eventually you will adjust
Can't you just get another one?
Maybe you can just get another job.
Oh no_comma_ you should probably deal with the consequences
How do you feel about that?
Don't worry too much about it_comma_ worrying can actually make you preform worse. You can always retake the test!
You got it!
Wow_comma_ then you know how it feels. I hope you do great.
I bet you won't have anything to worry about. We will both excel.
Oh no! I've never seen that movie_comma_ but it sounds like it was very horrifying! Have you watched it as an adult?
Well_comma_ at least you were able to conquer your fear!
Wow_comma_ that is sleazy_comma_ what did you do?
I do not know_comma_ how did you discover that was the case?
that is sad i wish you and your family the best of wishes
that is normal when you lose someone_comma_ but time heals everything
That is gross_comma_ what kind of food?
That is nasty_comma_ you have to kill that habit!
That's great_comma_ we all deserve to feel peace and happiness with how our lives are going.
You're a kind person to wish that.
How did it go?
Oh no! I hope you didn't feel too humiliated.
That something which you should be proud of.
I hate interest too. It is always to pay cash.
If you were given the project_comma_ it's probably because someone thinks you can do it!
It's a very good feeling when someone has faith in you! Good luck with your project!
You should get the same sneakers then.
Just save up and eventually_comma_ you will be able to get them.
Were you scared? Hope it wasn't a mean dog.
Good idea. Glad you got away safely.
Oh_comma_ good luck! Are you nervous for the job interview?
It's so great to be prepared! I'm sure the interviewers will be impressed!
Sounds like you're ready to ride out the storm. Are you afraid?
True. I bet it was a mad house at the supermarket today.
That is so nerve racking. I'm sure you will do great.
Do you usually do good in math? It is my favorite subject and always came so easy for me.
Yeah_comma_ that can be a tough time. Pretty soon he'll be off to college!
Well_comma_ I am sure he will meet a bunch of jolly good fellows while he's still in high school. You just got to keep on top of him with his grades and he will be fine.
Hey_comma_ I'm looking forward to it too! Can't wait to crush my co-workers.
I play on the PS4. It's the only way to play Madden.
what book you reading?
lol i feel you_comma_ i too am lacking in that department
That is too bad. How did they get hurt?
Ouch. I hope he didn't lose any teeth.
Why did you think he was after you?
Although you might have really been scared your story sound kind of funny!
Oh_comma_ lucky you! What's his or her name? 
That's so wonderful. My boyfriend has a cat named Smoke (I call him Smok) that I love sooo much. Good luck!
Yeah_comma_ that feature is pretty nifty. Makes it so you don't have to keep hardcopy photo albums anymore! 
I feel you man. Seeing pictures of my baby son tears me right up.
That's really nice of her!  Was there a special occasion or anything?
Dang_comma_ kind of reminds me I should probably do something nice for my wife...
That's unfortunate. What type of exam do you have?
How ironic. Unable to study finances because you're at work making your own.
Oh no_comma_ what's up?
The anticipation must be crazy.
Nice! What kind of cake was it?
Those cakes are really good! I believe they are made of dried milk.
Was it planned?
That's terrible. Did they give you a reason?
Wow_comma_ what a lucky day for you!
Pizza is my absolute favorite_comma_ I could eat it for the rest of my life.
aw looks isn't everything.
Wow. I've gotta see this guy then.
How unprofessional of your professor to say that! What was your project over?
Silver lining: she said she didn't want to fail you_comma_ so at least you passed your project.
Atleast you gave something it's the thought that counts right.
As long as she knows where your intentions are the amount doesn't matter we all wish we can do more but we do what we can don't be down.
Oh man_comma_ I bet you didn't sleep for weeks!
No_comma_ it wasn't. I bet you learned your lesson not to steal pretty quickly.
That's so cool! What did you think about that?
Very interesting. Maybe I should look into that to connect to my great grandmother.
How did you cheat?
Hopefully_comma_ you pass at least.
Oh dang. Did anyone come eventually?
Well_comma_ at least you weren't left there for all eternity.
Reminiscing on memories how old was you are ya'll still together?
So young lol well at least it's a good memory and the good weather makes you happy and think about it. 
They usually are. Who's wedding did you go to?
Of course! I'm sure he appreciated you being there!
I hate it when that happens. You should get a lock for the fridge.
Some people just have no consideration. You deserve to eat your leftover Chinese.
i bet your excited_comma_ wish i was you
good for you_comma_ send me a post card_comma_ enjoy
Well that's nice of you. Did he give you anything in return?
Wow. I wonder how they even saw that the grass needed to be cut living in darkness.
Well_comma_ at least he/she feels better now? Sorry about your shoes.
Wow. I didn't know shoes could cost that much!
Wow_comma_ that's quite the career leap! What made you do it?
That makes sense to me. Money doesn't always equate to happiness. Hope you are doing better now!
Aw_comma_ I'm sorry. Losing a pet is very hard. I recently lost a cat. It hurts.
Thank you. Yes_comma_ even though it's been a month since we said goodbye_comma_ I still look for him around the house. 
Oh wow! Are you afraid of heights at all?
That's great! Maybe I should conquer my fear of heights that way_comma_ too!
Wow_comma_ that's incredible! Good for him.
I think so too_comma_ he knows what it's like to be down and out and to work hard for his own success.
I'm sorry to hear about that. What are the risks if you were to go through with it?
That is definitely risky. Is the alternative of staying sick better?
That's awesome! Math is pretty tough.
Glad all that studying worked out!
Aw_comma_ I am sorry to hear that. Are things better now between the two of you?
Distance is sometimes the best healer. Glad to hear things are patched up.
Oh no :( did you take him to the vet? what kind of dog is it?
Those are such smart dogs! I hope it's nothing
That can be scary! Do you feel prepared?
You'll be okay! Use the age old public speaking advice_comma_ picture everyone in their underwear! Good luck!
I hope it turns out well!
It must be such a relief. I'm happy for ya.
Nice! How did it turn out?
I am sure she will like it as long as you followed the recipe.
That's awesome! Good luck to ya.
Are you a math major?
That's an interesting combination. Did you make it up off the top of your head?
I like how creative you got with it_comma_ I'll need to try it sometime.
New jobs nerves is pretty normal. Get a good rest!
Oh man_comma_ that nervous_comma_ hu?
Dang_comma_ that sucks. Do you have an insurance policy on it?
Nice. At least you won't lose any money.
That's adorable! What was the word?
Oh my. That is quite a unique first word!
Yeah_comma_ it can be tough. Especially if you're in a heated argument.
I know right?!? Sometimes it's just best to be quiet_comma_ even though you know you are right_comma_ to help things get better.
I know how you feel! I don't have carpet in my living room for that reason- Sometimes they have accidents. I hate poo accidents especially!
Oh yes_comma_ best to have her not alone ever during this time.
Was it yours or the bank's fault?
If it was the bank's mistake_comma_ even if you didn't have enough money_comma_ they're responsible for fixing it.
That's perfection. I rescue animals as well.and have many more cats then that lol. It is very needed to help cats
Me too! It's very hard sometimes_comma_ like running an orphanage but it is rewarding as well!
How old is it? Did you guys play on it a lot together?
That's cool_comma_ I don't know the first thing about building my own pc.
Did he/she say something you may disagree with?
That sounds unprofessional. I thought they were supposed to sound neutral.
I didn't know such a thing existed! What store?
Oh! That's a nice program. Well getting any amount of groceries for free is nice_comma_ but yes too bad it wasn't a supermarket sweep
I'm sorry to hear that. Is something wrong?
LIttle things build up sometimes. I hope you feel better as well.
Was it Domino's pizza?
Because I love Domino's so that's the only pizza I think of!
Oh who was there?!
Oh sweet. How's the new phone?
That would really annoy me! Did you end up taking any action against them? I know some companies will tow a vehicle that does that.
Man_comma_ the nerve on some people. I would never take somebody's spot if they have a sign up for it!
What a glutton. Did he happen to have a mountain of crab legs?
Man_comma_ I feel bad for his stomach. It's probably as worn out and bloated as my great granddad.
50?  That might be a world record or something.  How did you find out?
I guess he learned his lesson.  Only eat 25.  ha ha.
I agree_comma_ I loved that show so much when I was little.
I agree_comma_ what's your favorite?
Mental illness is very tough to deal with it by themselves.
Who are the caregivers? His/her parents? Or Children?
Are you in trouble?
Well they can be_comma_ but make sure you buy it next time. Ramen is super cheap :)
That must have been very nostalgic
Kids grow up so fast. Gotta cherish every moment sometimes.
That is tough.  How is she doing?
That is terrible.  Has she cut off all contact with them?
How'd it go?
That sucks. And you guys studied the same amount?
How do you feel?
That's great! Hopefully_comma_ the meeting goes well.
Pet alligator! Why do you have him as a pet_comma_ is he a rescue?
Well_comma_ I'm not sure about that or how are you typing?! 
Oh yeah? What did your dog do?
Awwwww_comma_ that's so cool. I remember when my dog was going through all that over a year ago. They learn so fast.
Nice! What is he working on?
I'm sure he won't. Sounds like he's a hard worker.
Oh wow. I wonder what that kind of bite feels like. Did it hurt?
Right_comma_ have to train them not to I suppose_comma_ if at all possible.
That is good. When do you have the exam?
Good luck.
Dang. Why don't you just get your own?
That's reasonable. Just make sure you get your own when you have the funds available.
That sounds like a lot of fun. What do you do now?
Oh so sorry to hear that. Well maybe you can round them up for something.
I completely agree!  I am all about keeping the earth clean_comma_ recycling_comma_ and low waste living.  They should get bigger fines!
I'm right with you.  Oh_comma_ cigarette butts gross me out_comma_ not to mention second hand smoke which has been found to cause cancer too.
Oh god. Does that store have sanitizing wipes?
Some people just aren't considerate of others like that.
Do you normally do makeovers?
Wow that would be so cool! I don't do makeup good on others. Did you do anything with her hair?
That's wonderful. What was it?
That's so cute!
Nice! Is she happy about it?
That's too bad. Maybe she can come with you?
That sounds about right for the bus station_comma_ unfortunately. How did everyone react when they saw it?
Wow. I hope you don't ever have to see anything like that again!
Haha_comma_ I wouldn't worry about it. There is much worse things you can do. Unless you're doing something you shouldn't be doing online!
Yeah_comma_ well maybe you can offer to pay for half of it instead?
That's terrible! Did you say anything about it?
Yeah_comma_ I would be too. Hopefully they'll invite you in the future.
Oh no_comma_ is it a young dog or an older one?
Right_comma_ puppies are like that. It took mine a year and a half before they weren't having any more accidents like that.
It's really nice that you feel that way_comma_ even though you wanted it. Think you'll get it next time?
Well_comma_ it certainly sounds like you deserve it. You sound like a good person.
That's awesome. Debt really is an awful thing.
Glad all that hard work paid off for ya. I aspire to get there someday myself.
Oh wow_comma_ that's great.  What unit are you in now and what made you want to change?
That's awesome.  Are you a nurse?  I used to work in the NICU.  It was a wonderful job.  Good luck with your new position.
Wow! That is pretty amazing IMO..unless she isn't good with kids..My first almost killed me..and I am terrified to do it again..
Aw well_comma_ as long as she is a good mom_comma_ more power too her :) Children are great fun.
Oh no. What's going on?
I'm sorry to hear that. Are you thinking about changing your diet and exercise routine?
Did you at least study?
ok
Nice. How long did that take you to learn?
That's really great. You should go join the circus.
Must've been a good burp.
Must've gave them a good chuckle. Don't worry. They'll get over it.
Oh man. Was she mad?
Dang. Well_comma_ I am sure you won't make that mistake in the future!
I bet.  I love fast food soooo much.  What did you have?
It really does.  I feel your pain on the no wheat policy.  I used to eat fast food all of the time and now I am a no wheat no oil vegan_comma_ so No fast food.
I'm not celiac_comma_ but I just eat whole food plant based.  It has been hard for me because I also hate vegetables (not good for a vegan) but I drink a lot of fresh vegetable juices and whole food smoothies to get the nutrients in.  I feel so much better now_comma_ though_comma_ that I can't go back.  Check out the Happy Pear on youtube_comma_ they have great vegan recipes.
I am very sorry to hear all of that_comma_ it is a little more expensive_comma_ but I found I feel so much better I can actually work more o make up the difference.  Check out Dr. Michael Greger_comma_ too if you haven't he is a great resource as well.
Oh no!! When did this happen?
Oh_comma_ I feel you! I used to be a food addict as well when I was younger. It is a hard habit to break! It's amazing how far you have come though! So many don't realize that fresh real food make a difference and you feel so good when you get real nutrition!
That's too bad! Do you know if you can buy a new one before the show?
Yea_comma_ maybe you can find an alternative. I lost a few shirts over the years before too_comma_ it's no fun.
I wouldn't be able to keep a surprise like that!
Sounds like you're ready to go!
Wow_comma_ that's quite the shift! Did you have any difficulties leaving things behind you?
Best of luck to you_comma_ I hope everything works out great in the end!
Was the dog upset about something or was he/she just telling you whose boss?
She probably bad mouthed you while out there.
That's too bad. Maybe she will find a new one soon.
That's always a plus. I am sure that will make the search less stressful.
Is the dog potty trained?
That's why I don't have carpeting.
That's really nice! Did you guys reconnect?
It's always great to reconnect to old friends.
Fear when you are a child can be so gripping.  What were you afraid of?
That is really terrifying.
That is really mean. Why does she do it?
I would too if my wife did that. It's alright_comma_ man.
That's unfortunate! What style food did your favorite restaurant serve?
Dim sum_comma_ huh? I haven't heard of that before. What exactly is that?
Where did you take her?
What did she eat on your date?
I'm sorry to hear that. Are you saving more?
Yea. You should definitely hold off on buying a new car for now.
Oh my god!! she must have been raised in a barn!
Like a bathroom maybe!  some people really just dont understand manners.
Haha_comma_ that's funny you mention that. I seen the same thing happen to a girl when I was at the grocery story one time.
Yeah_comma_ it must be a pretty embarrassing moment. Although it's an honest mistake.  
You have one as a pet?
That's great_comma_ losing a pet would have been awful.
Yeah_comma_ I sometimes do that as well. But_comma_ as long as the bills are getting paid_comma_ I guess you can't complain.
True. But_comma_ you can't help stupid people from getting high paying jobs. I am a prime example.
Is the first time that he ran away?
Then it is a little bit scary. Did you try to find him?
That sounds awesome! Have you guys been friends long?
That's pretty cool. You guys must have a good relationship. 
How'd it go?
I wish you luck anyway!
That's disgusting! Why are cats so rude?
I hope that that was the last time you have to clean up any messes! Sending my prayers!
Really?
I would like to come there and see it_comma_ how are you doing it?
I haven't actually. Have you?
I've heard good things about the Navy and also how tough it is.
That's awesome! Good luck on your finals!
Don't forget to get some rest though.
Nice! What kind of food do they serve?
That sounds incredibly tasty. I think I will have to go there.
That's so kind of you!
aw I'm so happy for it. Do you miss it?
Wow_comma_ that's pretty nice of her. I wish my girlfriend would cook for me!
Yes she certainly does! I guess she makes up for it in other ways!
That's awesome! Was it your birthday?
They sound great! Happy birthday to you!
I think that's normal. What were you afraid of?
Must've been really terrifying. What did your parents do?
That is so sad. What happened to her mom?
That is really said. I hope that she gets a new mom some day.
I am sure you did fine. Did you study hard?
It will be fine! You'll be staring at an A before you know it!
Oh my that does sound really relaxing. The weather was nice?
That's great. I'm glad you got to feel that feeling.
That is no fun! I have been feeling lonely lately too_comma_ Where are your frineds?
That is lame! what was their excuse?
Oh no! Does she have any applications outstanding?
True. Sometimes you have to lower your standards to something more realistic.
That's kinda sad. Is he studying or something?
Yeah_comma_ pushing herself could end up to her having a horrible life.
I would've been angry.
That's funny and also kind of a waste of pizza.
They sound very helpful and caring! Would you take their classes again?
Awesome! That makes me glad that there are still teachers and professors that truly care!
Why aren't you looking forward to it?
I hope it turns out well whatever it is.
She is a saint!
I don't know how anyone could turn an abused child away..it's not easy but they need help.
Whoa that's terrible. Did the police catch the robber?
Yes I would be too. I hope you catch them and I hope he didn't loose too much stuff.
Thats a strong relationship _comma_ im happy to hear people like you still exist in this world
thats disgusting _comma_ then why even be in a relationship waisting someones time
Nice! Was it tasty?
I love having that feeling. Especially after eating a healthy snack!
Oh lord_comma_ I bet! Do you start early and what is it?
That's comical. Most of us don't reach 90.
That happened to someone else today too! That is a bummer but is she just a puppy?
That is good. You are better then me..I rescue but I would hate having that on something new.
That's kinda creepy. What do you think happened to him?
Hmmmm...Maybe he just went on vacation?
Wow. Where ya going?
I don't think the polar bears are gonna let you near their coke_comma_ man.
That's really neat. What kind of dance was it?
Wow_comma_ sounds pretty impressive!
Oh no. What happened?
How long ago was this?
where did they go
oh .. do they visit often? 
Your car door?
Was it parked at home? That sucks
was it tax free weekend?
ah.. that sounds like a smart move.
Wow really? That's interesting. And yet he still teaches? 
I guess he really does do it for the passion of teaching then.
That's good to hear. What's going on?
It's good to reunite with them again_comma_ hu?
That's pretty awesome. Do you usually run marathons?
Glad your hard work paid off. Was this marathon for a good cause?
That's a really good idea_comma_ smart thinking! 
Well hopefully nothing bad will happen and you won't need to use it.
Oh no_comma_ do you know what caused it?
Oh god. I'm guessing they didn't take responsibility?
oh wow.. do you think they can handle it?
thats a good idea then if she can manage it 
Sorry to hear that! Losing pets is tough_comma_ it's essentially losing a family member.
I hope you find the peace that you deserve and know your pet loved you!
Wow! That is awesome!
Will he be in school this year?
That is nice. How old is she?
That is awesome.
Oh_comma_ pity. Speak with them daily.
I'm away from my family for the past 10 years.
That's good to hear. Have they been there for you in the past?
That's so kind of them. I'm glad you're repaying their kindness.
were you able to make it up?
oh good luck!
What. Are they still viable?
Will you get a refund?
I hope you did a really great job.
That's all you can do at this point 
That was so nice of her! What kind of food?
Wow_comma_ that's impressive. A very exotic dish for sure!
Tennis? I am terrible at that game
Well if you were playing me you would definitely win
That sounds like fun. Do you not go out with them anymore?
Hey being single isn't that bad! You'll find your soulmate one day when the time is right.
i would feel the exact same way _comma_ how come it did not work ?
that is a little aggravating _comma_ i would be pissed too 
it is a great time of the year
i agree.
Ooh_comma_ cool_comma_ what are you gonna do while they're away? 
Nice_comma_ sounds like a relaxing weekend.
Sorry to hear that. What were you upset about?
A C is not too bad. I know how you feel_comma_ I hold myself to a very high standard as well. It could have been much worse though!
Oh no that's so dangerous. Are you okay?
Yes_comma_ I would be too. That was so irresponsible of them!
That's very nice of you. I hope you guys have a great time!
I'm sure it will go well! What are you cooking?
Sorry to hear that. Sounds like sleep for you might not be in the cards tonight?
I'm hoping for a miracle for you so that you can get a little bit of shut eye!
That is nice. Do you take them frequently?
That is a good surprised.
Oh no! I hate to hear that! Have you found another place yet?
Well I think you'll be able to sell it for a good price.
its funny what one saves _comma_ i saved a mickey mouse that was given to me while i was in the hospital things like 20 years old lol
good times _comma_ you got to hold on to the memories 
That's why they are being replaced by machines lol
I thought I had seen every episode of lock down. I haven't seen that lol
Oh no! I hope she's ok. Have you taken her to the vet?
I hope she does too. Maybe spend extra time loving on her tonight she she'll feel better.
I hope so too. Stay inside just in case.
I hate lightning. It makes me jump every time.
What are you going to do?
Won't you visit?4
Oh man_comma_ that always leads to trouble for me lol
They probably changed their crust or something_comma_ they always do that mess.
I know that feeling
I know right. I was never truly explained the world of "bills"
me too _comma_ but i had a long day at work and right now im just relaxing in the cold air for a little bit longer 
that sounds like a great plan honestly 
That's wonderful. It always feels good to pay off debt I think.
Yes_comma_ you must be very proud for accomplishing that.
Whats goin on?
That should be fun. I have to work this weekend. I need to hang with friends before I go crazy
Bedtimes can be really hard for the kids and the adults too. LOL
Oh no_comma_ I have to take her side now. Summer's are made to break the rules.
6
The place didn't fall apart did it?
Well_comma_ that has never happened to me. I never think about work when I'm not there lol
yeah thats annoying _comma_ its happened to me before
i used rope from the warehouse once as a belt 
That's how it works_comma_ for most of us lol
If only they had told us sooner.
Did you usually visit them?
That's cool! Are you gonna go all out with decorations and things?
Are you nervous? I'm sure they're gonna love you.
Then throw the whole dude away and get you a new one! You deserve the best!
That is a real bummer. I hope you got a security deposit. They won't be getting that back.
Make sure to leave feedback on their profile. Hopefully they can't get any more rentals.
I am sure nothing will happen to you.
I understand. Sometime_comma_ I become also superstitious.
Did you flip out?
That's true. Were the questions even important?
From you drinking it or someone taking it?
I think it's time to hide your drinks from them. It works. That is what my Mom did when I was a kid.
Are you concerned about aomething?
Think positively. Stressing yourself out can definitely cause a problem
That's always fun_comma_ the kids always love it so much
Probably so but they'll remember it in the future and have fond memories.
Oh no! Are you okay? 
It's okay_comma_ everyone makes mistakes sometimes. I hope the other driver is okay.
Oh no_comma_ about what?
Oh no_comma_ I've been there done that too many times.
OH no
You won't believe how many times that has happened to me
that is really fun to do_comma_ waht did you buy?
i really like going once a month to buy something i really want helps with my anxiety
Oh no! I can only imagine how that would have felt! How old was it?
Aww that's so sad! But it's good to know she will be remembered
Yay! I am excited for you_comma_  Have you known her long?
HAHA I see I see_comma_  Thats good! I hope it goes well and you fall in love
dont we all :)
Seems one would know where that kept such precious things
I never got into the pokemon craze
Well that will be fun for you guys!
Oh no_comma_ I hate to hear that. Did he have a good reason?
I have been thinking about it too. ITs hard out here
I know right. Especially for women.
Awe I love weddings! Were they having a big wedding or a small one?
You will when the time is right and it'll be beautiful.
I love it when I something takes you back to yesterday. It's just so nostalgic and that can be a great feeling.
So true. Whenever it happens I just close my eyes and embrace it.
Well that was really nice of you to do. You sound like a great neighbor.
I'm sure she really appreciated it. I know I would.
What did you have to do to get it?
Better luck next time. 
Oh no! Did they see you?
Still though_comma_ that's some crazy stuff to be walking in on though!
omg_comma_ Yesterday I did the same thing_comma_ but I was late to class!
UGH_comma_ thats the worst! atleast you have a nice friend!
what song was it by chance ?
that does sound terrible
I don't know if I should laugh or cry or both on the one lol
I'm sorry_comma_ I didn't mean to be rude. Hopefully his demise showed someone out there that drinking is bad and made them change their life.
Alright! is that a big money promotion for them?
Thats great! did yall go out and celebrate?
Did you cry?
Well it looks like you survived!
Do you mean that literally or are you just ready to move?
Don't give up. I know it can be discouraging when your trying so hard. But it will happen.
How did it go?
Im not sure if that's good or bad.
I am so afraid of coasters.
That is very unlikely. Thats what they say.
Would you believe I have never seen one episode of that show? How sad that it's ending before I even got to watch it!
Well don't tell me what happens_comma_ I might just go watch it all now lol
stuff like that makes me wonder if they had been talking to each other the whole time
i feel you _comma_ but you will find someone better and he downgraded lol
I've never seen that but I love a good tear jerker!
I'll have to check it out this weekend. Anything about the holocaust makes me cry.
That's a smart move! Good thinking!
That's so nice of you to help them out! I'm sure they're really thankful.
Where are their parents?
Call the police. I would. 
Well. hope you score high.
Yeah_comma_ It is!
Oh really? And why is that?
Wow_comma_ any reason for that?
I hate that feeling. Are you still feeling that way now?
Well I'm glad you found your friends_comma_ that's a terrible way to feel. I've been there before.
That was a crappy thing to do. Better get a handle on it now or it could become a big problem.
They probably deserve it but you know the old saying two wrongs don't make a right.
OH no. Is that a good thing?
My daughter will be 14 this year. You just made me feel old lol
Oh man_comma_ honey buns are the best snack cake ever!
I'm the same way. I'll eat them in the car on the way home sometimes lol
Wow_comma_ nice! Congratulations that. You must have worked hard.
I hope it was all worth it for this moment. Good job!
That's sad_comma_ are you throwing them a going away party?
Well I'm sure they'll like that and I bet they're gonna miss you too.
Who chose the place?
Cool. I love italian. Real italian.
That's because you worked hard and never gave up! I'm proud of you!
One day you'll be able to. Just keep your head up!
Someone was recording him from the shadows
I wish I could do one
They make me sad too. I wish I could heal all those sick kids.
It makes me feel better knowing that they get such great care at St Jude's and the parents never get a bill though.
You must have been terrified. Did you see it happen?
That is so awful. Was he a the victim of a crime or was it some type of accident?
I would have been so scared. What did you do?
Did you ever find out who he was?
Oh ok_comma_ I hope you are enjoying it. Why only one receiver?
Well that was a good choice then! It will save you some money too i'm sure
It's about time then. Maybe now you will be able to get the back payments too.
It's hard to depend on it. Don't figure it into your billing. That way if he doesn't pay it can't hurt you.
I could never do that.
You couldn;t stay at work until the next day. My job requires security to walk females out when its late.
wow_comma_ You didnt want to be around them that bad?
LOLOL thats actually hilarious_comma_  I guess thats why its ex now lol
uh. maybe its not something that important
OH. I get it. Thats good then
Those are so much fun. Family or school?
That will be great. Take lots of pictures_comma_ you will want to remember all of those memories you are going to make.
Makes sense
Yep. That always happens

I would try and just wear shorts!
On christmas morning_comma_ I got everything I wanted.
Really? 
All of them?
In your jeans you did?
What?
Well thats cute

You and me both. 
I have never seen a movie before
I wish one day i could see it.

Haha! that is no good you must have gotten no sleep.
Why didn't you drink water?
RC Cola lol. I havent had that is years
That is terrible_comma_ have you told him how bad that will be?
Maybe you should get married!
Why is that?
Well that terrible
I always wear shorts everywhere.
Thats the way to go about it!
Did they get your shorts too?
Call the police
That was sweet. Did you eat together?
She sounds like a keeper
How do you feel about that? Are you ready?
Oh I see. Speeches always make me a bit nervous too... but once you start_comma_ it gets less worrisome I think.
is there still a chance to get any??
oh my gosh_comma_  kids refuse to sleep_comma_ i feel like i kind of do that as an adult too though
Well thats a positive spin
Food solves lots of things lol
I wish i had kids.
I think they would make my life worth living.
I don't like them either
Lol okay then!
I went to college for a few years.
I did not like college much
I thik thats good
Why do want to fight?
Yes! that can be once of the best times of the week.

Packing lunch saves money
Ipack my kids luch

yeah i can relate to your anger i have kids myself and have expiriencee similar situation but after you will remmeber and laugh together
Yes! I always regret when I impulse quit a job.
Yes! was he a bad boss?
Thats great
I know that feeling. Stressing doesnt make it any easier though
 I hate snakes!
I stay far away!
I feel as if dogs think humans are the most comfortable bed!
Yes! cuddling is I feel an instinctual joy!
Ugh gross! I have to say I have seen worse in food before!
Yes_comma_ Im constantly thinking about whats in my food!
Blind dates can be so nerve wrecking! How did it turn out?
You'll improve what you need to I'm sure. At least the experience was worthwhile.
I know right! they keep going up in my area its crazy!
That would be amazing! You could skip alot of traffic
I keep all my photos online.
I can not even imagine how that would be.
Good for him. What sport do they play and was it any of that state level competitions?
Seems promising. What position does he play?
WOW_comma_ I would be quite upset_comma_  Atleast let me know before you do that!
wow_comma_ Thats unbelievable.  Did you let her know it upset you?
oh man that's actually hilarious I hope he was a baby...?
yeah that's pretty scary and gross! 
Yes! where did you go? do you feel relaxed?
Yes! I bet it was great_comma_ probably really nice weather. 
Pay you for what?
You can sue!
Every summer for me is too hot to go outside.
I would have left right now!
What guy?
how am i supposed to know?
I also go to sleep during movies.
We can sleep when all of the movies come on together!
Really?
That's cool
How was your drive? were you driving fast??
Wow_comma_ he was high on alcohol! I hope he didnt hurt anybody.
are you scared of them or why do you run from them?
i enjoy a little rain every once in a while_comma_ but i dont like thunderstorms either 
Oh_comma_ did you check what could be that?
Do you believe in ghost? 
Whats wrong?! is he not obeying your rules?
That is not good_comma_  He need to learn he has to respect you.
That is great. What game was it?
Did you get a trophy?
Oh my god_comma_ Are you doing okay? What hapened?
Oh my god.  I hate when people are so careless.
That would have to stop immediately or that shovel might be used for something else.
If he won't stop you may need to take a picture of him doing it and then contact the authorities.
Yes_comma_ Life moves so fast its truly hard to believe some times.
I couldn't agree more_comma_  Sometimes It feels like I was a little kid just yesterday.
I know what you mean_comma_ I don't even bother at this point.
Exactly the same for me. Don't let it bother you too much.
Awe that is sweet_comma_ was it a special occasion?
That is good! just a reminder that you have a father that loves you.
Yes! That is the worst_comma_ I feel like my time is being wasted.
I say just keep putting yourself out there_comma_ cant give up.
What was the big day then?
Oh cool_comma_ I hope it goes well!
thats pretty cool
wow thats crazy
I would say that is one of life simple joys_comma_ not a care in the world.
I try to do that as often as I possibly can.
that is not cool_comma_ what where you guys planning to do
if he had other things to do it is ok_comma_ but i hate when people  cancel just beacuse they are sleeping haha
I have no friend at all.
Maybe try a bar with food!
What did you do with the money?
What was it? Was it clothing?
Yes! life is a blessing_comma_ and we need to make the most of every day.
God is good to people.  He is always there for you.
I would have thrown up!
I would have left the entire house!
Did you take any medicine?
They want you to take their medicines?
Maybe try and watch tv or play games.
Maybe go outside and try and eat dirt.
I guess because they are healthy and don't taste that bad.
Really? Must be some bad peas.
Maybe they found a lover to share life with.
That changes everyone's life.
It's a good feeling when you are successful after you have worked so hard. 
The way you felt should be motivation to keep up the good work.
oh really i bet i would be too
yea i know what you mean
that is the most beautiful thing ive ever heard
that is a great plan!
I would cry if anyone i know died.
That actually sounds super sad.
That must of been scary.
Where are you staying right now?
I am also looking for a better job.
I mow lawns for a living_comma_ and it is so hot.
I'm sorry to hear that. What will you do now?
Like in Community! You'll have a great time and I'm sure everything will work out well.
What kind of pizza was it?
I prefer New York style pizza.
That is not cool of them_comma_ did they have a good reason?
well anyways it is really bad on their part that they did that
What did you order?
Did you get them to recook it?
i agree.they are not taking my guns!
i  agrere
oh yea? whats that.
oh thats nice_comma_ wish i was doing something similar
Oh I hate it when that happens!
I tend to get road rage and lay on my horn at times like those.
Yeah? Why was that?
Good. I loved school too.
I wish i was one of those people.
If i could make more money for less work i would any day.
Oh no! How fast were you going?
Harsh. How much is the fine?
That is great news. How did the interview go?
Who is the interview with?
oh wow that is horrible_comma_ im sorry for your loss
wow thats young
What kind of test?
Are you in college or high school?
What was your last job then?
Sounds like an interesting job. I hope you get that job that you're looking for.
Was it with close friends?
And nothing bad happened?
Thats a good plan. Did the snow and ice come?
Like the Boy Scouts - Always Be Prepared.
There is not enough money to get me to do that. My sister likes those kind of shows and I watch with her sometimes.
OMG! Were you grossed out?
Oh that's terrible. Was he busy with something else?
Ah I see. Must have slipped his mind while he was hard at work.
Do you know who did it?
Did you call the police?
have you thought  about saving money?
Yeah it is hard for some people to save money_comma_ for me it is kind of hard not to spend what i have
I honestly hope they do not.
I'm more of a football fan!
Where did this happen?
That must of been embarrassing.
wow that is crazy? did he?
good thing it ended well
Wow! I don't know much about baseball_comma_ but I know Babe Ruth. New York Yankees_comma_ wasn't he? The house that Ruth built.
I'm sure he'll love that. It must be quite valuable.
Wow_comma_ that is really tall.
Are you done growing?
I am not sure what that is_comma_ but I wish you luck with it.
That is actually nice_comma_ i like rock music.
Amazing! Were you close when you were young?
I'm glad you got back in touch then. 
I see. How was the show?
It sounds like an important film. I love watching documentaries.
really?
Why?
What kind of pen are you talking about?
What do you write with it? Do you write a letter or a book or a shopping list?
Why is that?
I am not American so I am only vaguely aware of them.  They are an American new channel is that right?
What a lovely aunt. You must be her favorite nephew or niece
Maybe she tried to bring some warm strings in relationship with you
Oh no. It happened to me recently. But_comma_ I take the4 view that things like that happen for a good reason and you'll end up in a better position down the line.
I am in exactly the same boat. I'm still searching for a new job. It's tough. But stay positive - it might not happen!
That's so funny! I mean_comma_ that must have been embarasing!
Such a shame. Were you very young?
I love pizza. Did you make it by yourself or with friends?
Were you the only one who are it?
Really? why?
lol
Who is he that you are speaking about?
Do you want your friend to change?
I'm in the UK - when is Labor day? 
Wow! That'll be amazing!
That is a good thing. How long have you been with them?
That is a long time. Why not get married?
Will you not be sad to leave him?
That's a good way to be.
why is that?
wow. i would also fee sad
Oh that's exciting! When are they coming?
That's excellent! I bet you two will have an amazing time!
What are you making for the dinner?
Will you make any dessert?
Really? Lot's of people seem to disagree with that
Good - I'm sure he will be good for the business side of things.
Was it delivered by Fed Ex_comma_ UPS or by the US Postal?
I have never heard of them. What was in the parcel?
Oh no! Why not?
Can it not be rearranged?
What position do you play?
Who is your favorite team?
Oh me too. Social cues seem to get lost so easily on people these days.
My pleasure. It needs to be said. 
i love the becah_comma_ im there every weekend
i live like 10 min away
Really? that is crazy
I can't imagine that
5 eh? Good - that's my favourite number!
Thanks again! 
Why did you get angry?
That isn't good. Did you speak to a manager?
+
Sorry - I mashed the keyboard. When is the UFC on?
any special plans?
ive always wanted to go on a cruise
How old was sammy?
I am sure you had good times. Will you get another dog?

You will be fine buddy. Type therapy for stoping cookie addiction on youtube_comma_ I am sure you will find something helpful there
Great! Why are you so happy today?
Brilliant! SO the summer starts now for you?
Wow! I hope so. Are you going to ask them today?
Good plan. Why are you so confident?
Why were you not allowed to go?
What did you do instead?
Did you return the item?
How long will that take to happen?
do you have a special plan?
im sure he will love it!!!1
Were you expecting the parcel?
What was inside the parcel?
Really? Why? Out of happiness?
Good point. But maybe_comma_ just maybe_comma_ it'll be brilliant.
That's a great attitude to have.
It sounds like you are very content. That's great!
Yeah - what kind of work do you do?
Good - it makes a big difference if you can enjoy your work.
OH no! I'm sorry to hear that. Are you alright?
Have you got plenty of people around to support you?
why was that? what hppened
ohhh..sounds super awkward
Well done! Did you buy all the parts separately?
Did you find it difficult?
Yeah - I've done it a few times and it's much easier than most people think. Still impressive though
Make sure you dress nicely and bring a positive attitude.  
Yeah no problem.  Make sure to do a mock interview with a friend or family member to practice what you will say.
Is this your first job?
What's wrong with the job you have now since you have been there for 21 years?  Must not be too bad.
what were you expecting
hahah...thats too funny
Oh no. Disgusting! 
That's a funny image. 
What kind of cookies?
Were they as delicious as they sound?
Were they chocolate covered cookies or chocolate flavored?
Man I'm starting to get a little hungry.
Wow. Were you hungry or just feeling like a treat?
They must have been delicious cookies!
thats really cool!what did she compete in?
wow! 17 catagories!! thatis a lot!
When is it?
How old is he then - 3?
Oh my_comma_ that doesn't sound good. Whats happening?
You should not tolerate that discrimination. I think you should complain to HR.
Well done_comma_ it must have been quite an experience
Maybe the baby is feeling you :) and knows that you two are related
Hm delicious. Do you feel proud of yourself?! 
Good work. Make some for me too!
Oh my gosh! Really? That's terrible.
What did the manager say?
how did it come out?
what did you put on it?
Scary. Did you investigate?
Phew! That's a relief!
Hm that sounds suspicious. Where do you think it went?
Do you feel afraid that there might be a ghost in the house?
Nice! Well done. What is the occasion?
Does she know you are going to be better groomed though? Maybe she liked that shagginess!
That must be so annoying. You should ask for a pay raise.
I see_comma_ time to switch companies! 
Oh no. Were you alright?
I know. Maybe get a cab next time!
I guess thats because he's in a higher position of seniority? 
That is aggravating. You should tell him that you need to get a higher pay for your work!
Amazing. Was there any scares?
That's cool. You live in teh future now.
That's a nice thought. Your wife I take it?
I wish I could fidn someone like that
that's great_comma_ what's in the package?
Oh_comma_ I guess you got a new boyfie. Chocolates are most often used to show love
They are really cool looking animals!
Are they friendly or aloof?
Really? No-one? Why not?
I understand that. Did you send out invites?
Oh sorry to hear that. How come?
I am sure he/she understood you were just nervous. You should make it up to them. 
i would have also. we always want to give our kids the best
yes_comma_ unfortunately it happens
how did that happen
ah well that would be a good reason then
Nice_comma_ do you feel nervous about it?
So you must have prepared well for it. I hope you get the job!
Amazing. Is that even legal though?
That's cool. Were you scared?
Yeah - do you think it went well then?
Good. I hope you do. When will you find out?
oh thats a good friend
thats cool
Why his pay was so big?
Then clarify this with any senior 
what happend after that?
wow. for some candy? harsh 
You must be feeling kinda lonely. Have you tried joining any meetup groups?
Good idea. Check to see if there any groups on facebook of your interest.
oh wow that's kind of gross
I don't know if I could even eat a squid if it was fully cooked
thats a great father!
you're the favorite 
Oh my_comma_ do you know where the dent came from?
Sorry to hear that. I hate when people do that and not even leave a note owning up.
I can't answer that! You seem lonely.
I hope not. Try to have an enjoyable life regardless
Yeah? - whats the job?
Really? That's interesting. Have you done it before or is this a completely new type of career?
i must have missed that one
ah yea i can only imagine
how did that go? did you have fun?
did he start anything?
OK
Why did you sell them?
Scary! Did you figure out what it was?
Wow I'm glad it wasn't something scary lol
Do you have a new job?
Wow. Big step.
Haha I've done that. She was probably holding in a fart_comma_ too.
Everyone farts_comma_ man. It's ok.
That's crap! Do you know what caused it?
Scumbag. Will it be expensive to fix?
what happened
im sure it wasnt as bad as you imagined it in your head unless other people watching the movie told you to hush
Why is that?
I know how you feel. You don't have to let go of them because the value you place on them can be carried forward for generations and that will make them priceless
That is good_comma_ so you must have prepared well for it.
I hope it goes well for you. Hard work tends to pay off!
I didn't know they still toured. I saw Korn years ago.
Me too
expecting something special?
that is always a great day!!!
I would have been too. How did it happen?
That has happened to me before. So aggravating! 
whattttttt....... why did he do that
im sorry to hear that ... hopefully he gets help to deal with issues
Really? In what way?
Nice. I suppose you get what you pay for.
don't think about it_comma_ what is done is done_comma_ just anticipate that they will call you back_comma_ the universe have it's way of helping if we believe 
Yes that's the spirit :)
It
It is always nice to have someone by your side when you need it
Really? why the delay?
So sorry about that
I would have totally screamed! Were you alone? What did you do?
I bet it did. I'm glad you were able to figure out what it was and hopefully you got some sleep afterwards.
Who was there?
So you just went back to sleep/
What did he do?
That's too bad_comma_ did you at least find your dog?
did something happen?
makes sense.
Really?
lol
Good_comma_ are you happy for him?
Yes_comma_ well children do have to be better than parents_comma_ evolution you know.
You should be proud you gave it your all
That's a great way to look at it. Stay positive!
I think skyping or video chatting with them everyday will help 
Aww_comma_ you must be a very sentimental person :)
what do you think it is?
oh thats gonna be a good gift
Why not? What did she do?
Oh my_comma_ have you found her or is she lost?
Really? Congrats 
That's a good one
That sounds like a plan! Who said that_comma_ might I ask?
Words of wisdom from him. Will you follow his advice?
Do you think you might get it?
Than I think you have little to worry about.
How did it go than?
Of course it was_comma_ but next time you'll handle it better.
Ha! Do you feel guilty nor or what?!
Exactly! but its okay to cheat a little every now and then!
Oh no! what happened after?
Wow I'm sorry you went through that. Not your fault_comma_ it happens
Because nobody taught them how to live right.
Government? No way_comma_ it is interested in quite the opposite my friend.
That is really good of you. Hopefully he doesnt decide to stay at your house forever!
Nice_comma_ I wish I had a friend like that!
did you just start the job?
i would also feel lonely
man that would have scared me too_comma_ was it an actual intruder?
that is too funny but I have done things like that before as well
Did your younger brother let it out or something like that?
Yes_comma_ this things happen_comma_ but as long as you find your dog after_comma_ it's alright.
Why?
Cool
Ouch_comma_ I am sorry to hear that. I hope you are ok?
What happened?
Well_comma_ I think you should get a new one 
You can ask your best friends if they have a spare before spending money on a new one though
that's great! it's good to be supportive of your partner
she sounds like a great person
oh wow_comma_ are you paying for her classes?
I have 2 daughters myself and hope that they get scholarships
And did you?
Sorry to hear that. Unfortunately lottery winning is a very small probability. 
sometimes you need to go against the grain.
ah yea .. well thats a good reason
Wow. I have always wanted one myself?  What model?
What color?
Oh goodness_comma_ what was it?
Oh_comma_ that is so annoying.
Well_comma_ just stop here_comma_ and all should be ok.

I am so deeply sorry! how are you holding up?
Hang in there....and remember it's okay to express your feelings
That's great_comma_ good for you for taking charge of the situation 
I think it's so important to not let things like that bother us_comma_ I'm really pleased for you. 
Good job! You must feel so proud of yourself! 
You should go out for dinner and celebrate!
I agree_comma_ are you sure you're buying the right groceries? 
Why is that? May I ask.
Why is that?
I know how you feel_comma_ you don't have to sell it buddy
Special package coming today?
wow that's awesome! I am the same way. As soon as I hit "complete order"_comma_ i am counting down the time
I bet.  How long will he be gone?
Maybe you could invite some of your friends over to ease your mind a bit.
Oh that sounds so scary!
Oh thank goodness it wasn't serious.
im glad the pupper was returned
i hate seeing dogs alone in the streets
oh no_comma_ did you catch them?
that stinks
what is Friday?!?!
Awww man!  You are lucky!  That sounds amazing!
Did you go into your basement?
Did your house get any damage?
I'm sorry_comma_ is it because their guitarist died?
At least they are making an album_comma_ that's cool.
I'm sorry to hear that... don't blame yourself
Hopefully he opens his eyes soon and realizes what he is doing
I think it's time to call the animal protection unit
I believe you will be fine
What job did you apply for?
Do you work for the government now?
what was it?
yea i can understand that
That's good. It means you will be on vacation and having fun
oh ok. it's good to catch up on old times with foreign friends
I am not married_comma_ so I am not sure.
Where do you go to meet women?
No way! I'd be so upset.... how did she react?
that's horrible
Ouch! Sorry to hear that! Are you mad at him?
I bet he does! But it was just an accident so hopefully you can forgive him. 
That is so cool_comma_ how does that make you feel?
Yeah_comma_ those cars are really pricey.
Oh poor dog! I hope he is okay!
I am glad to hear that. I hate seeing animals suffer.
That isn't good. Have you spoken to him about it?
You should talk to him. I am sure he will pick up if you do.
I can understand that_comma_ it is scary.
Oh that must have been traumatic.
i would have been pissed too!
i hope so too!
oh wow.. that stinks
hopefully you had insurance
That is very nice of your friend.
That sounds like fun!
Oh no_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that
Same here... it really sucks
Oh no_comma_ is your dog okay?
I hope your dog is found safe.
did he catch you
well at least you were unharmed!
I bet that must have taken you back to the good old days?
Any particular memory stand out that you care to share?
Glad to hear it. Did you get to relax at home?
Oh that must have been nice. It always cheers me up when my kids visit from college.
oh no!! did she find out about it?
that is such sad news
That is so sad. Did you comfort him?
That is so caring of you! Good on you for being a good Samaritan! 
Ah! That must be so frustrating. You should speak to him about this.
I would be too. I want my paper on time!
That's terrible_comma_ what did you do?
I hope that never happens again.
thats gross
wonder how it tastes 
Why were you scared?
Yeah_comma_ the woods can be scary at night.
That is so cool. You are so lucky to have been able to experience that.
I hope you enjoyed every minute of that. It sounds like a once in a life time experience.
Nothing like mom's cooking!
That's when you know you had a good meal LOL
That must so inconvenient! Are you having trouble falling asleep because of it?
Oh thats a blessing. As long as the baby is asleep_comma_ all is good! 
Why were you scared to go home alone?
That must be really annoying and scary.
those were the days!
this is true.
whos mom?
im sorry to hear that.
Really? That is cool
Why did you?
those are some good coworkers!
It's nice to work with people who care
I'm sorry_comma_ I hope you find it.
I think you will be fine.
congratulations_comma_ you will be spending time with your loved one again
I hope you can propose marriage to her when you meet with her
You must be quite confident in your abilities! 
Good to hear. But don't get too overconfident! 
Oh my_comma_ did they let everyone else leave early except you?
I would be upset if that happened to me. I hope they let you off early next time.
what did you do
oh thats good.. dang kid!
That sounds like fun!
I hope you have a good time.
wow that's horrible.. did you confront them>
I would be too
Really?
Tell me about the fun things
Oh really? How'd you find out?
Well at least you found out easily.
I love cats_comma_ they are the best.
Yes_comma_ cats can be difficult to take care of.
I can understand 
I though you went earlier to impress a girl
Wow! That's amazing! I'd love it if my parents got me gifts like that!!
I could imagine. Maybe I should drop some more hints.
That is good_comma_ its very important to have an instructor like that to calm your nerves. 
He must have been very passionate about teaching his students.
Oh man_comma_ where customers upset with you?
Sucks how customers blame employees like it's their fault
I hate when that happens but that is good they were quick to replace it. 
Hopefully it wasn't something time important 
Oh did he pass?
that's great_comma_ congratulations
did you look all over for them?
thats good...they are usually ALWAYS in the last place you look.
Oh my goodness_comma_ that sounds absolutely terrifying. Do you think they would've hurt you if they found you?
You'd probably be having even more nightmares. I'm glad you're safe_comma_ though.
That's a unique experience to go through. Does she have a nice location picked out for it?
Cool! That sounds really special and personal. I'm sure they both will really enjoy that!
That is very nice of your sister!
Yeah_comma_ maybe you should get her a gift of some sort.
I've never actually watched that show myself. But I've heard so many good things about it!
I tend to like shorter shows that don't have these super long ongoing plots. So I do have a bit of interest but I'm not sure if it's really for e.
I'm sorry to hear that... it sucks being in a "team" where no one wants to do anything
I would confront them about it to avoid it happening again
That's really exciting! Do you have any special plans for this weekend?
Well that does sound like a restful and relaxing weekend. I love traveling on my off time!
do you have roomates?
mine does the exact same thing! i hate it
Aww that had to be a little disappointing?
Yeah that can be life changing money! Maybe next time!
I am so happy for you!
Old houses are the best.
As a kid? That's the best!
Did you go often with your family?
Oh_comma_ what is it?
That must be so exciting!
oh no what did she say?
I would have laughed lol
You must be so proud. That really is a great accomplishment that he has made. Is he going to college?
That is so awesome. Does he have a major picked out?
was it an expensive one?
awww...still thats upsetting
Oh no! that's so scary
haha silly cat!
Yeah_comma_ you can really get in major trouble for doing that.
I would just not do it again.
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you know why your neighbor does that to you?
I think you should just continue talking over your neighbor. Maybe that will get your neighbor to stop.
Who does she talk to on the phone regularly?
So why does that make you discontented?
I can imagine that would be a painful waiting period. Why do you belive she is unfaithful?
I can see the why you would feel that way. I would be worried too.
The good news is the chances of actually getting HIV is relatively low. You should not have to worry about it.
I can imagine it would. You dont need that stress in your life.
Oh no_comma_ did it not turn out the way you planned?
That's awesome! Hard work always pays off!
Don't be so negative about it. Maybe you'll really like the person.
So then just let the person know you can't make it. There's no reason to waste that person's time.
That's very good of you. I would be proud of myself If I can do such a thing especially if there is a huge chunk of money in it
I hope he  or she rewarded you though
That's great! What kind of car did you get?
Wow_comma_ that is a sweet ride!
Oh no_comma_ what are going to do?
I hope they can fix your glasses.
i hate when they forget the cheese
i would have been too.. i love my cheese burgers
That is nice to gave a friend that can help you in time of need.
That is not good but my mistake happened.
Sounds pretty incompetent to me.  Have you found a new one yet?
It seems hard finding a good doctor these days.
Congrats! It's great to pass your test. Though staying up all night to study may not be the best studying technique.
That's good. I try to study well in advance. But I find it hard to actually motivate myself.
haha that's funny! 
I'm glad you survived lol
That must be quite nostalgic.
I miss the old times.
is it a newer model?
i would be too
I'm sorry to hear that. It's really horrible when a friend backs out at the last second.
There's always scalpers outside of concert venues. That could probably work.
Wow_comma_ what a forward woman.
Yeah_comma_ I'm sure you were.
lol...thats harsh! are you?
hahah...that is natural
That's great you have that kind of confidence.
That is very responsible of you.
first of all my condolences for your friend_comma_ and i know how hard this is for you both
ya it feels so weak to be in that place _comma_ but you should only give the strength required for your friend to overcome this situation
you can do it _comma_ i pray that you both overcome this situation with peace. 
That's awful! Maybe you can pay them back?
Oh wow that's tough. Hopefully they don't know it was you at least.
That is bad. I hope you will find something interesting to do.
I understand. Probably_comma_ watching a new movie could be good idea.
Oh yea? why is that?
I wish there is a way we can make people care more about the environment
Oh no_comma_ im sorry to hear that
It happens... but you never know their situation and sometimes people make bad financial decisions
That sounds so disgusting!
I would have done that too.
Why she want to divorce? Did she tell you?
That is terrible. How did you find out?
Yikes_comma_ did you miss a payment?
It shouldn't have_comma_ maybe you need to call customer service and question them as to why.
I am sure you are beautiful too!
I wish you had a higher self-esteem.
Wow! I can imagine how joyous that feeling must have been!
Congrats! That would be really stressful. I'm happy it all worked out for you.
Oh_comma_ no that isn't good. I"m sorry
Did he just freeze up on the test or was it different then the stuff you studied?
i hope all goes well. was something the matter that made you decide to have the tests done?
always good to check if in doubt
Oh no I am so sorry! I bet that must have been scary too
wow they should care more that youre safe!
I love pizza. What style pizza does the place make?
Yeah_comma_ that sounds very exciting.
Uhoh I hope you didn't get in trouble?
Well you can use that feeling to make sure you don't do it again!
That is terrible. What did you do?
Well that is a good way to look at it.
That's great_comma_ trust is the backbone of all lasting relationships.
Of course_comma_ we're not meant to lock ourselves away alone for our entire lives.
That is bad. Did you go to a doctor?
Then nothing to worry about.
I do too. It always brings back so many good memories.
Yes it is. Sometimes I wish you could just go back to that time.
I am sorry to hear that. Thieves are really crappy people.
I hope they catch the person and you get your laptop back.
Oh wow! Are you okay?
That is insane.  Thank God there was someone there to intervene.
Oh why is that? Do you play?
Ah_comma_ yeah my husband is the same way. He is very excited.
Good for him! That's a very valuable skill to have_comma_ good on you for teaching him so early.
Does he seem to enjoy being in the water_comma_ or does he resist you a bit?
Oh I know that feeling actually... Did you ever make up with your friend?
That's good to hear. It's all water under the bridge now_comma_ as they say.
That sounds like fun_comma_ what kind of movie will you see?
Nice_comma_ I love those. I have seen a preview for a shark attack movie that is coming out. I think called Meg_comma_ I hope to see that sometime
I love eating there_comma_ the food is always amazing.
I am glad you had such a good meal.
I hope it wasn't a close friend that lied.
That is sad.  Liars and thieves are just the worst.
I don't blame you.  A friend like that isn't a friend at all.  I'm sorry that has happened to you.
That's embarrassing_comma_ but also funny. How did your date react?
That is awesome that she didn't make a big scene of it!
Why?
I understand. It could be little bit scary at first but it is fun.
Aww :(  What did you end up doing instead?
You could've always come on here and chat with other cool people like you :D
Oh no_comma_ are they going to be okay?
Oh_comma_ that will be so fun!
Oh my_comma_ I hope she is ok?
I would be too!  Was she at fault?
Wow. It is very unsual to see that.
Why? Do you want to do like him?
That is so sweet of your child.
He must be very smart!
That's annoying! Did you end up eating it anyway?
Sorry that you had a bad experience!
Wow_comma_ what's the special occasion?
Yeah_comma_ that is going to be a lot of work_comma_ and hard to transport to your job.
Aww was it your birthday or something?
OOO Kid Rock that's one of my friends favorites!
I bet_comma_ its always nice to get a chance to work with someone you really like.  Where do you work?
That does suck.  I work at Taco Bell making burritos.
You must be very proud of your new set of teeth
Congrats you can smile freely now :)
What preferences do you mean? You shouldn't have to say your truth to anyone.
There's nothing wrong with that and it's a shame people even question you about that.
Congratulations! When is the wedding?
I'm happy for you_comma_ I hope everything continues to work out!
Oh no! That is so sad for you.  How embarrassing. 
how sad.  I am so sorry you had to deal with that.
Oh no! Did you manage to avoid a stain?
Don't feel ashamed. You'll be able to laugh about it soon enough!
How did it went?
That is terrible. What are going to do?
Oh god that sounds terrible! Are you okay_comma_ is everyone in your house okay? Did anyone get hurt?
I'm glad to hear that no one in your house got hurt. Gang crime needs to be stopped!
I'm sorry that happened. Do you still have contact with him?
Cliche as it is_comma_ time heals all wounds and whatnot. I hope you can find somebody just as great as him or learn to be content on your own!
That is horrible! Do you think it is really true_comma_ or she was trying to just make you angry? 
You can always try to get a DNA test.
Are you worried and nervous?
I hope they do and everything is ok
That is terrible.
Who fault it was?
Sorry to hear that. Is the feeling mutual?
That is awful! Hopefully things work out for the better for you!
Oh my lord_comma_ I would have been terrified. Are you okay?
I am glad to hear you are okay.
I feel you! Summer is great and all but I miss my classmates and the work I'm studying.
I hope you have a successful semester!
How did you do ?
Congratulations_comma_ I hope you get a raise.
Oh. I hope you get it! 
That's a pretty substantial raise! 
Oh no! What happened?
Wow!  I would have been spooked about that too.  What did you do?
are you?
thats true.
How fun! How did you all celebrate?
That's really nice of you. Catfish sure sounds good to me right now!
Yeah_comma_ I remember mine as well. They were always a great time.
That sounds like so much fun_comma_ too bad those times had to ever end.
WOW!  Congrats!  Was it hard contest?
You must be very smart!
Nice! what kind of car is it
You're pretty lucky to have a boss like that haha
Oh goodness_comma_ that is terrible.
Yeah_comma_ delivery services have really fallen off.
OMG!  How nasty!
Did he at least offer to share with you?
I'm sorry that happened. Maybe she was tired from working all day.
Oh_comma_ I understand. Have you talked to her about how you feel about it?
I have never had greek cuisine
There aren't many restaurants where I live. Only fast food.
That is great_comma_ she will fit right in!
What an excellent way to start school!
What are union memners points?
Oh. Maybe they should lower the fees or up the rewards
Sounds fun! What movie are you going to watch?
Oh. Well that's lovely.. I suppose. Lol. Maybe you should amend the movie night rules with a different theme every time so they are more constrained to what they have to choose from! Haha!
Nervous? That's interesting. Has anything changed recently? What are your thoughts on why it's happening?
I see. I'm sorry you're having trouble with that. Have you thought about therapy? Maybe your health insurance will cover a free consultation or something. Or perhaps you just need a simple routine change_comma_ with some exercise and more time outside. I hope you find the answer_comma_ whatever it is.
That was rough_comma_ how long ago was this ?
I'm sorry you had to endure this.
That's pretty nice. I'm in college_comma_ and I've had three different roommates so far_comma_ having to move three different times. Starting to get old. You truly lucked out!
I hope you guys are able to keep in touch. With that kind of experience_comma_ it sounds like it could be a good friend for life. As we get older_comma_ we let those kinds of people slip through our fingers. Try to maintain it as best you can.
That is too bad. What are you going to do? Was this your first time gambling?
That is too bad that you had to learn a lesson that way. I am sorry.
It's nice that you tried to comfort him.  I'm worried about my parents_comma_ also.  It's hard to be worried about something like that in your family_comma_ knowing that you have no control over whether or not it will happen.  It's sad.
Agreed - it's very stressful.  I live half a country away from my parents_comma_ and I'm worried I won't be able to help when either of them need it.  
I feel for you. My girlfriend is in the same position. Luckily we don't have kids to complicate things_comma_ but her job wears her out and it doesn't seem like she can physically or mentally keep up with it. Kids just make it so that you feel you have to do it until you die_comma_ no matter what.
At least it sounds like you're giving it a lot of thought. You sound resilient. Most people would just quit or get fired_comma_ or not even realize the negative impact it's putting on their children. You seem very self-aware_comma_ so I'm sure you will be able to figure out the best decision for everyone involved. Good luck!
What did he do?
That stinks. I'm sorry about that
Omg I was about to say that is so mean and rude and I would be so embarrassed but I know it was a honest mistake I dislike the auto correct. 
lol I hope your friend understood and they can still meet up or communicate and if things work out it's a funny to tell in the future. 
What happens on Saturday?
That sounds really cool. Have fun!
I think it's about time you lay down some rules!
Is this a roommate situation or are we talking about kids? 
Oh my yeah I would have been pretty irritated! 
Yes it stinks when things just dont work out_comma_ but keep your head up_comma_ Im sure you will find someone you like that will be a big help to you!
Nice!  Six months is a long time to be car-less.  I'm sure you have a new sense of freedom to do what you want and need to do while he's at work now.
That's funny - true.  Hopefully the good part outweighs that_comma_ though.  
Well that still makes you a great friend! 
Sounds like you all should stay away from bars lol. But if it keeps you acting good at home_comma_ then so be it. Your friend sounds like he needs a crack too
That's cool.  What type of supplements
That sounds pretty healthy.  Have you always been this health conscious
Have you had trouble lately?
I hope things go well for you too.
Oh really? I hate winter though! I don't want that to arrive :)
I prefer it over the winter if I have to make a choice
It's nice that you have a meaningful item from her.  It's a pretty bittersweet feeling thinking about someone you loved who is gone.  
That's nice - it's nice that you have memories like that.  I only have a couple of items from my grandparents_comma_ and I treasure them. 
That would take such toll one me. Just make sure they have enough to keep them occupied maybe.
Might have to bring them to the park and tire them out. School should starting up soon.
That's awesome! It's always pleasant to have a good day.
Little surprises like that really bring a new meaning to life!
Oh_comma_ I hate it when that happens :( Have you looked on places like mercari or ebay?
Yes! I get makeup I need more than half off on those places
I find this context hard to believe.
Oh geez! Really_comma_ that is interesting_comma_ but why would they want too!
Are you a cop yourself
Dang whereabouts do you live man? I'm in South Texas sometimes cops are like that here too
Well that is kind of you. They must really be going through something.
That would be a lot to deal with. I hope things stay good for awhile.
Oh god! I would be SO TICKED! Do they have cameras?
That is AWFUL! My mom had that happen too- An old guy hit her atthe gas station and sped off! Seriously not fair!!
Oh man that sounds horrible. I would probably faint.
It must have hurt so much. 
Thats amazing_comma_  I am sorry for your loss_comma_ But atleast you have a constant reminder of him.
Thats so sweet.  He is probably looking down happy you are wearing it!
Oh no!_comma_ Did you ever end finishing it up in time?
Thats good_comma_ I just finished studying for a final_comma_ And I barely finished in time!
Oh no that's terrible! Are you going to apply again?
I understand. Maybe apply at a different bank this time.
Woow. That is terrifying. Are you alright? Do you live in some rural areas?
Thankfully. Hearing your story_comma_ i am terrified now to even walk in my back yard anymore
Yes_comma_ that always saddens me too. I see them now and then.
Yeah_comma_ there should be_comma_ but often there is not really a good option for them.
Good for you.  Being honest is important.
Sometimes that's the best way to learn
The note is for what?
well_comma_ expect my note too_comma_though it would be a soft copy
What country? If you don't mind sharing...I'm in South Texas and loving it :)
I'm sure you'll meet some cool people if you find a good Pho restaurant!
Wow she must really fancy you. You should ask her how she found you.
What a random surprise. Just make sure its not some creepy stalker. 
Oh that is so gross! I hate bugs too!
I hope none of them found a way home with you.
Wow_comma_ so close to graduation!  What does he want to do after he graduates?
Oh no!  I hope you're able to.  I know its hard for kids to look at the longer_comma_ bigger picture of life sometimes and just what he's going through now.  I took my GED early at 16 and graduated so maybe he wants to do that and start something else sooner.
budget for what?
You mean you have a budget for life?
What?
Maybe she has too much on her plate?
Mistakes happen! I am sure people aren't too upset. I have numb hands so I drop things all the time
That is true! But it's part of life_comma_ stuff happens. Not the worst!
Feeling a bit scared about the weekend.
I have a hard time with my anxiety sometimes and I will be alone a lot this weekend. I don't like free time_comma_ I like to stay busy so I don't think much.
I don't trust a lot of people. I do like being alone sometimes but if not then I just want to be with someone I trust- They are not always available.
That's annoying. So_comma_ does it still work and it's just hard to use_comma_ or does it just do nothing in general? Deals are always tricky like that_comma_ as sometimes they're too good to be true.
Yeah_comma_ especially since customer service is usually where companies skimp and don't try to hire or train employees very well. Well_comma_ I hope it has a good resolution in the end and something works out in your favor. I'm a clean freak_comma_ so I'd hate to not be able to clean properly when I wanted or needed to.
That is just sad of a Dad to be that way. Kids need a lot of unconditional love..but parents aren't always perfect and sometimes don't know how to love their kids like they should !
Still doesn't make it okay. I hope he gets some therapy and learns to be a better dad
Oh gross!  They should have street cleaners taking care of that.  Poor animal.  
I bet.  I have never seen one up close so that turns my stomach too.  I can't stand seeing injured_comma_ hurt_comma_ or dead animals. Hope you're feeling better now.
I bet you are proud!
Good I wish him all the best!
I agree. I used to be a deadbeat but now my life is dope.  Are you talking about a friend or family member
Yes you can lead a horse to water...but you know the rest
Definitely not a sucker! If she helped you a lot and you wouldn't be here without her_comma_ then YES! Why did she block you? Were you bad to her? Sounds familiar to what has happened between me and a few...I was there for them but had enough and I have had to cuit them out too-
That is hard..I have been abused and burned...and sometimes you just can't go back..It's like the story of a the girl with the feather pillow..once you say something..you can't ever get it back and it's so hard to repair. Its hard to ever trust someone once they have broken it..I am there myself and don't know if I could ever trust or live with that person again. Life is hard but I am VERY glad you have learned and will treat others better
That's always a weird situation. You're excited about the offer_comma_ and you're worried that if you turn it down that you might not be able to find anything else_comma_ or as good. But you also don't want to be tied down to a bad place. What were some of the red flags_comma_ if you don't mind me asking?
That's a really tough position to put yourself in. You would know better than most. I'm a cautious person.. if I felt like there was even a 50% chance of being able to find something close to decent_comma_ I'd turn them down. But if you think it's a desert out there and you can't find something to come close_comma_ it may be worth gritting your teeth and being there for a few years before you try to move on. I hope it works out!
That is tough. I would just make sure everything is nice and clean around the house so she can just unwind. Maybe make a nice dinner and do the dishes after.
I see. I would maybe only bring it up if she wants to discuss. It a hard position to be in.
Anywhere else? lol- You do not have a lot of thai places in town?
Everything to me lol!  Sweet and sour chicken is the BEST
That sounds like a fine day to me. Do you have many birds?
Hah I know how you feel I love to feed birds and watch them outside my house as well.
Oh no! I am so sorry- Turtles need a lot of care to thrive
Actually they are_comma_ that is why so many die in captivity..They need proper lights and diet etc..I guess if you know how to take care of animals then no- but so many just don't care when they have a pet who relies on them
What happened to the first one?
I'm sure it will be fine.  Did you buy a good brand?
Yeah occasionally stuff breaks during shipping.
So sorry_comma_ you never really can tell with these things can you?
I wish you good luck.
Me too. I cant take this heat anymore. It is so muggy outside. Its so annoying.
Same here. The humidity is just the absolute worse. 
is there anything like free cash?
i had that nothing good come easily
Oh nice.  What type of presentation
You think it will be a big success?
That's awesome!  Any new changes lately?
That sounds fun! I'm glad youre more comfortable now.
Can you have it repaired?
Yes_comma_ I'm sure you'll be very nice to her.
I am so sorry. I know that must be a difficult time.
I hope you can find the positive in the situation and move forward. Focus on yourself.
That should be fun. Where does the cruise go to?
The Bahamas is beautiful. I am sure you will love it.
They really do make you stronger dont they. It may not seem like it right away though.
That is a great way to make the best out of the worst. Good for you.
Good luck! Hope you do well
I'm sure you'll get a good grade if you prepared well
wow_comma_ that's grate. Are you also a musician?
complete family with so much talent
That makes you a queen.
What's that ?
Wow! That would be an awesome surprise to come home to!
I would love to have that happen for me! You are lucky!
Oh you did? What kind of job?
Are you a stylist? 
That's great! How can you tell you are on the right path?
Congrats! That's awesome
that is good_comma_ i hope nothing went wrong
you should be proud of them. Nothing like family
I hope it works out for you then.
Well stick in there and you'll go far.
Wow_comma_ that would be a huge accomplishment if you did it!
Excellent_comma_ hopefully you will share some of your wealth with me.
That's great.  She sounds like a passionate and independent woman.
I wish her and you the most abundant blessings and wealth and success.
That was nice of him. What was it?
That is great! Were you able to help pick it out?
what kind of weather is that?
yah_comma_ safety first. 
what kind of fun did you remember having there
wow quite a long time
He should be fine if he has prepared. I hope he does well.
That great. Im sure you are real proud of him.
Oh well maybe you'll get your blessings in a different way you didn't expect
It's cool_comma_ I got fired from my old job 5 months ago...only to upgrade to a self-employed lifestyle_comma_ making 2000 a week and hot chicks coming in and out of my apartment every night lol
its sad but true_comma_ people dont want to see others doing well! got to be ready to protect what is yours! 
just keep working_comma_ learning and trying new things_comma_ cant go wrong like that i think!
Sounds exciting!
Well I hope you have fun and I hope she does well.
I bet that was frightening and nerve racking.
At least you made it through allright.
Did you play there a lot as a child?
Well_comma_ I hope you can recover from that as time passes.
Im sorry to hear that. How long has she been sick?
Absolutely! I would do anything for my kids too.
because she wanted to give you a surprise present
hahahahah_comma_ i like the suspense_comma_ she is good at giving surprises 
Horror movies give me so much anxiety. I cant watch them late at night.
Maybe watch a comedy tonight. That might help out a little.
That is amazing.  Those moments are wonderful and priceless!  How old is she now?
I love when they are young and it so fun to see what they learn and discover each day.  When they say enjoy every moment_comma_ they are so right!
It is the start of their learning journey_comma_ be excited!
Definitely_comma_ I wish them the best
Oh no_comma_ have you made adjustments to ensure that wont happen again?
I bet_comma_ kids need a lot of eyes on them_comma_ but its a catch-22 because you do not want to be too over protective
Oh no_comma_ is she ok?
I'm so sorry. Do you have a good support system?
How much is that?
Oh wow_comma_ that will help you out immensely.
The quality of driving is going down and down.
Yeah_comma_ I agree. we've have to drive carefully.
Did you want to go to New York?
Maybe you will win something else!
Oh no!  Was it a big one or not that big of a deal?
Oh good.  Well_comma_ at least its a big deal to you because that means you're taking things seriously and concerned about your work.  
Oh no_comma_ did people make you feel bad for the accident?
That sucks_comma_ if everyone pitched in to help it probably would've been cleaned up in record time.
Yes all it takes is cutting back on some things you maybe dont need. I know it can be  hard to do though!
Yes! Even $5 a week helps!
Oh that's terrible!  What did you do with it?
Good choice.  Can't mess with a brown recluse.
Do you think it will be good news or bad news? 
Very exciting. I hope you get it.
Awesome_comma_ do you plan to go early to try and get autographs?
Enjoy yourself_comma_ if I may_comma_ refrain from recording it on your phone_comma_ just be in the moment!
I personally have not_comma_ You must have though?
That's amazing. You sound extremely confident!
Oh no_comma_ did you get angry with him?
Thats a fair punishment_comma_ they have to learn somehow
Oh how exciting_comma_ to the big island or somewhere else?
Take advantage and make a lot of memories with your family!
Oh no.  I am so sorry.  I have been there and its devastating.  How is everyone doing?
It will take time.  Allow yourself to grieve and also doing something to remember your pet can help give closure.  Take care and take a day at a time.
That's cool. What does she want to do there?
That's cool. I have worked in a hospital as a nurse before.
What role did your child use.
Awesome_comma_ I am sure you are proud of his individual effort.
Do you have something exciting happening?
That's great!  I would be pumped!
Is there another class you can apply for?
That is a shame_comma_ keep your head up and hopefully you can get into it next year.
Oh that's really lucky!  What happened_comma_ did someone run a light or something?
That stinks_comma_ but I'm glad he's ok!  That must be the scariest thing!
Do you know what kind of spider it was?
Did it get you?
Oh yeah? What kind of activities?
Oh neat. I love those kinds of games.
What exactly happened?
Could you call the police?
uhmnnn! so what then happened after that?
So how did you respond to that?
I haven't_comma_ though I've stepped in other poo.  Is it similar to others?
Dog mostly_comma_ cat once or twice.  Possibly human_comma_ but I'd rather not think too hard on that.
Oh good.  I'm glad you were prepared.  How did it go?
Perfect!  Nothing better than being prepared and accomplishing something well!  Great job!
That's exciting! How do you feel about it?
That sounds great. I hope it goes well!
Oh I have always wanted to live at the beach_comma_ I bet you will have a blast
Best part about it is you will never have to leave!
I hate parking tickets!  What a rip off.  How did it go?
Sounds like you were prepared.  Did you get it dismissed? 
The company must be doing well then?
Ahh I see what you are saying. Maybe yall will get bonuses.
Just show them what you have accomplished this past year
Just be confident in your ability!
Congratulations!  What degree did you get?
Awesome!  I bet that's a really versatile degree_comma_ you should be really successful!
Oh man! That was so nice of him! You're lucky to have him
Hopefully you can pay him back in some way! 
Are you fully prepared for it?
Great_comma_ good luck to you!
Why do you think that is?
Yes_comma_ do you ever remember playing in the ocean?
Oh man_comma_ kids can be terrible about things like that.  They just have no filter.  What did you do?
Well_comma_ that's the best you can do_comma_ is teach them what's appropriate and what isn't.  I think you handled it well.
So did she accept your proposal?
thats nice to know_comma_hope you find happiness together?
How proud of him were you?
Just keep admiring your child.
That's pretty good.  you know what they say_comma_ "C's get degrees"!
I know I sure didn't in college.  Did you get a job in your desired field?  That's what really matters.
Have you thought about telling the store?
To clear your conscious 
That's great! what will you do with all the extra time together?
sounds like fun to me! enjoy the time.
Those two years must have been tough.  But this sounds like an exciting opportunity for you!
Good luck in the final stage.  I hope you get the job.
They're super creepy. Did something happen?
I understand that. They just give off such bad vibes.
Can you go to a shelter?
Stay away from the windows just in case.
That is so wonderful that you have something of hers.  I'm so sorry you lost her.  That is so difficult.  Did she love cooking?
You still have her right there with you!  Its wonderful to know that you're keeping her food and memories so alive!
Yea that is kind of a weird situation. I am sure she would want you to have a good time though.
I wouldnt let it ruin a good time. Just dont mention it anymore maybe. Im sure you feel a little guilty.
Are you glad you watched TV all night or did you wish you'd done something else?
Oh_comma_ I know how that feels. I've done that myself nearly every night.
I'm sorry to hear that. have they done any tests?
I hope everything turns out for the better.
Well that's unfortunate. Do you think the party will be fun?
Oh that sucks. I hope you guys can work it out.
wow! that's what i call couple day out!
can i come with my wife too?
thats amazing_comma_ im happy for you too
keep up the good work
Oh man! Good luck to her_comma_ are you envious?
I'm so glad that you're happy for her! Start the climb yourself! Maybe ask her for some help?
did you inform her?
Apologize to her. Don't feel guilty.
What kind is it?
You are quite welcome
Can you give an example as to someone who amazed you recently
Have you ever played yourself?
Wow! that was incredibly nice of them.  What kind of business is it?
I need a haircut soon myself.  I hope you do really well
How long do you have ?
No_comma_ it's good timing. If you had waited_comma_ you wouldn't have been approved for the mortgage. Don't forget to file for unemployment insurance.
That is always good!  What happened?
Normal is a great place to be!  There is something to be said for just being happy and content with what you have!
I don't disagree. Why do you feel that way?
I can see that. There's a lot to be worried about.
How many do you get per day?
Should be ending soon and you can go back to your normal life without those pesky calls.
Thats super mean of them.  Did you give them bad candy?
Too bad_comma_ You couldve done something really good to them.
How did it change?
Well congratulations_comma_ spoil yourself with it!
Exciting!  How are you settling in?  It might take a while but you'll start making friends and setting up a community around you.
I can understand that.  It is usually very isolating to move_comma_ especially if its away from family and friends.  I did that as well and found I had to consistently get out and try to meet people.  It wasn't always a success but after about 2 months_comma_ I started to have things to do.  Keep your chin up and go explore your new city!
That is great to hear. Will you be taking advantage of your life now?
That is great_comma_ I am so happy for you!
did you get caught
its okay
Do you find some along time good? do you like being alone every once in a while?
I can imagine_comma_ when my daughter leaves with her friends on the weekend i miss her like crazy too
whats that for?
So what did he accomplish?
Could you fight them more for the refund?
I am sure_comma_ I hope you can get a resolution
That sucks.  My parents are divorced.  Same reason.
Its never good for anyone. 
That is awesome_comma_ keep it in a safe place.
I do not think you will anymore
What day is that?
Yes Fridays are wonderful!
Was it a surprise?
That is such a great feeling_comma_ they must really care!
it's a rose plant. I'm waiting for the blossom of the first flower in that plant.
Could you explain?
Where did you buy it?
That's awesome!  Anything particular you're ready to accomplish?
That's great.  I love the feeling of being prepared and ready to crush something!  History can be tough too with all those dates.
Wow thats awesome.  I tried learning the piano once.  I wasnt good.  So i can really appreciate good talent.  Im always impressed
Yea he must be really good then.  7 years is a long time.  I bet you can impress people with your skills
i bet he will_comma_ everything always gets better dont worry
like some one once said_comma_ time heals everything just have a positive attitude
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. That must have been awful.
I can't even imagine what you're going through. I hope your friends and family can help you.
They should be required to pay you for that.  They would charge you if you tried to cancel that close to the appointment time.  So annoying!  Did they give you a reason?
Ridiculous.  Doctor's think that they are above everyone else and it drives me crazy!
Amazing! I'm so proud of you for your dedication! 
Oh dang! That's always the worst isn't it
That's so exciting! It's almost over! But I can understand why it'd make you anxious_comma_ too.
Yeah. That last year is really important. But I'm sure you'll do great!
Uh oh_comma_ did you try to play it off or did you have to ask your husband?
Haha_comma_ that happens_comma_ hopefully he wasn't offended by it or anything.
I certainly do.  I think it shows you care and have compassion for their situations.  So many people lose that compassion and even practice indifference. How about you?
I can understand that.  I mean_comma_ you're with them as you watch everything they go through and you start to really like them.  When it ends its like_comma_ was this not real?  I hate coming to the end of shows that run for a long time.  So sad.
Thats really sweet of you and I bet it means the world to those people.  Its great to show kids compassion and being nice to people
I remember being scared the first time I went to visit my great grandmother in a nursing home.  But once you see that they are just people it makes everything alright
That must be hard having to be happy for someone that has what you wanted.
It's normal to be jealous. It is a product of goals not fulfilled.
Campers are awesome_comma_ have you tried socialising with him? maybee he can invite you to see it from the inside
hahahah i bet he is a nice guy and will let you see it 
I'm right there with you! I hate pineapple on pizza_comma_ it doesn't belong!
It throws off the flavor of pizza completely.
That is sad_comma_ but maybe you'll make new friends at school. Is it your first year?
I'm sure it'll be fine. Everybody will be in the same boat. I hope it goes well.
Thats great! At least you found it 
I would do the same if I had something special like that 
thats unfortunate_comma_ maybe she will learn eventually though
she will be fine then!
Oh no_comma_ were you driving in it_comma_ or were you actually outside?
Was it a thunderstorm?
What did they do to scam you?
What was the opportunity?
Did you put money on the reno?
Haha_comma_ that wasn't very wise.
That's great! Are you excited about school too?
Ohh wow! Well good luck and I hope you have a great time with your friends and school
Wow_comma_ that is horrible_comma_ what did you guys come down with?
Wow_comma_ I hope you guys get better if you already haven't.  That's really a bummer to miss out on a family vacation!
That's wonderful!  I know how important that can be!  Our family of 4 only has one car so you need it to work!  What happened to yours?
Awesome!  I know_comma_ isn't that crazy how much repairs can cost?  Its ridiculous.  Well_comma_ happy travels!
Oh yeah? What's happening on Saturday?
Congratulations! I hope you have something fun planned to celebrate.
What is it about?
The sounds very interesting_comma_ I am sure you could find others like it as well
Did you do it on pourpuse? and if so did you feel bad after?
but it was an accident on your part so dont feel so bad about it
Was it yours?
Eww. Im sorry about that. That would have ruined my lunch quickly
They must be a very good insurance company to be able to keep your business for that lnog!
Well that's always a plus. Having a good relationship with the company or someone at the company can go a long way.
That is amazing.  Most of those guys have been training for years for that level of eating.  What kind of pies were they?
He really should.  Some of those folks make really good money just to eat a lot.  Pretty sweet gig! hahaha.
Oh no! Sorry to hear that. Can you get it fixed?
Wow that's expensive! I hope you can find a reasonable used car.
That's cool_comma_ I'm not too familiar with it myself.  Is it pretty interesting so far?
It's always nice to get lost in a good book.  One of my favorite hobbies.
Oh no!  That is always terrible when technology stops working well.  What did you do to fix it?
That's awesome!  You are talented! Maybe it'll go for another year so you can save.
Congratulations! If it helps at all_comma_ my wife and I have two young boys and both of her deliveries with very smooth! She said it wasn't as bad as she expected.
I think those types of situations are rather rare! The medical field has come a very long way. I'm sure you'll be fine and it'll all be worth it in the end.
im glad you were not harmed
im sorry_comma_ im sure it wasnt your fault
That's great! I love to design websites
That's neat! I learned in college so I've had time to delve into it quite a bit and it is very fun. You choose great!
That's no good!  Sorry about the rug. is she still a puppy?
I'm sure she'll learn quickly_comma_ and she'll be a good dog then!
Disneyland is awesome_comma_ I went there twice as a kid!  What did you have to eat?
That's true_comma_ it's like a whole different world when you are inside the park! Very magical.
so do you hope to do there?
can i join you?
Where are you headed?
Wow! Well I hope you enjoy yourself and pray before you go on the plane
Im sorry to hear that. How did she die?
Oh wow! That stinks. How are you holding up?
I'm so sorry to hear that! My sister went through something similar last year and I can tell you that it will help a lot to spend time with her as often as you can.
Stay strong! Hopefully in the future she can have a healthy baby and be able to move on from this tragedy.
Aw_comma_ that's never fun.  My husband used to travel all the time for work and it was so lonely.  I'm glad she won't be gone too long.  I took advantage of the times he was gone to clean and organize and fix things to surprise him when he returned.
Wow_comma_ you're on top of things! Being apart does make the heart grow fonder. :) Make (or carry out) her a romantic dinner when she gets back. Go out with a friend while she's gone!
Did you do everything right?
Well that stinks. That happens though. Sometimes you do something right and it doesn't show the same result as its supposed to 
Why didn't you sleep well?
I am sorry. You should get some sleep now then
Oh no_comma_ why'd you have to cancel?
Maybe you can plan for another time?
Holy cow! That's amazing! Congrats!
That's really amazing. How generous.
I HATE when that happens. In my case it was a dog_comma_ I caught him on camera! Maybe you should invest in a security cam?
I hear if you sprinkle red pepper all over your trash area it can help ward off some animals.
Oh no!  That would've made me so mad.  I let my kids use my computer too but always say_comma_ no drinks by it and wash your hands.  Kids always seem to forget that. 
It is a hard balance because they need to learn and it should make you mad_comma_ but people do make mistakes.  So hard to know how to act really but things are too expensive to not treat them well.  I hope you're able to find an easier way to fix it.
Did you not go?
That stinks. You should go this weekend?
Oh no! I'm really bad about that_comma_ too. Did you ask someone or try to play it off?
Nice. That's a good way to do it.
Mom of the year award! That's awesome_comma_ where are you going?
That sounds fun_comma_ hope you guys drive safe and have fun!
I haven't seen it yet! How good was it?
I dont blame you. I am looking forward to seeing it now
Why do you say that?
Great job! I bet the boss was really proud of you
Yay!  I love the end of the work day!  What are you going to do when you get home?
What a perfect way to end the day!  I'm going to make a big chinese stir fry and watch tv.  Have a great night!
That sucks but_comma_ i'm glad you're enjoying your self still.
I think thats a good idea. Look at it as an opportunity to make new friends.
That's good_comma_ are you going out later?
That's awesome_comma_ hope you both have fun.
That is good_comma_ did they cheat  on you?
Ouch_comma_ that always hurts.  I've been through that_comma_ and know that sting.  Hope you find a better partner who cares for you!
I look forward to the day where I can say the same! That must feel liberating!
Wow_comma_ you must be very financially responsible! I'm sure that'll help you do well in life. I'm practicing myself.
I wouldn't want another car payment
That's all you need.
what if he doesn't pay?
well _comma_you need to consider the option of him not repaying too
That awesome! Did you guys have a good time and catch up?
Thats good to hear_comma_ always nice to see friends from your past!
how old is he or she?
he must be a great achiever
Good job_comma_ you should do well on them if you're prepared!
That's the mindset you need_comma_ good luck_comma_ I'm sure you will get A's!
Good luck_comma_ are you pretty confident you're going to do well?
Yay! That's what makes all the hard work worth it. Congratulations! 
Treadmills are great! I find that they're better your knees than running outside.
That's awesome to hear! We only get one body_comma_ we need to take care of it. Good luck!
That's so amazing. It's an incredible thing to be a parent!
I wouldn't change it for the world
Do you have a lot of debt?  I'm sure you will figure it out and get back on your feet.
I have a lot of student loan debt as well_comma_ I just focus on making sure I pay monthly.  I try not to think of how much I owe
well_comma_i wish you sucess
you need my friend_comma_its just like a success spell
Who did?  What happened? Are you OK?
Wow!  That's horrible!  Don't feel bad though.  She is obviously just a gold digger.  You most likely just dodged a bullet!
Did something specific happen?
I think that can affect even the best of us_comma_ I wouldn't let it get you down.
Thats really sweet of you to help her out.
haha_comma_ yea thats a good way to look at it.  I never thought of it like that
Are you scared you may want to in the future and it would be too late?
It is never too late!  You can always adopt!
my cousin and my aunt are both teachers and they love it
haha. it's alot of work but it's rewarding
oh no. what was it?
that can be so traumatizing. i'm so sorry.
Its always so exciting to take a trip or vacation.  but its even more exciting to see family
Haha_comma_ yea thats how I feel about my In laws.  Im glad they are a 4 hour plane ride away
what sounds like a wonderful time?
That does sound like a lot of fun.  I miss hanging out with all of my firends
why are you so mad?
Yes my friend experienced the same thing recently. It is a terrible thing especially when they make you pay to repair it.
Oh wow yeah that is quite impressive! He should become a lawyer if he isn't one already!
Yeah_comma_ I have heard some people have that! Sometimes after just reading a bunch of information just once can remember every single word!
Haha!  I know exactly what you are talking about!  I love that show and yes_comma_ it is quite gross!  You must have felt quite disgusted!
Ooo!  Yuck!  I hope you don't get nightmares from it!
oh no. what happened?
oh goodness. where you able to make it out of there without getting sick or dirty?
That can be a lot of work.  We are trying to go through that now too_comma_ so i know how you are feeling
My thoughts and prayers are with you guys.  I hope you succeed.  Make sure you keep practicing
that is awful_comma_ why did he do that
did you tell him the truth?
I can imagine that was very scary! I don't know if I would be that brave!
I guess it was a lifetime opportunity too. I'm sure it was an amazing experience!
Why do you feel that way
That does sound hard
Uhoh. be careful_comma_ there are some bad drivers out there.  Especially with people playing on their phones while driving
Ive actually called the police during a situation like that.  I was worried someone was going to get killed
Do you guys not get together as much? 
I know that feeling_comma_ I have a brother I don't see as much as I used to.
Dogs are the best
That was very nice of you
i love driving past old places from my childhood too! they always seem much smaller than i remember
its great that you were able to go visit
That doesnt sound very safe.  I hope you dont lose power
well stay inside and stay dry
That sucks. I know how you feel.  Do you have a day job?
That sucks. I've also been through that. Among other benefit cuts.
thats pretty neat.  I think that might be worth a lot of money
well that might make it more valuable to you then.  Does it still work?
Well... did you?
Ah too bad you're married.    Pro's and con's
Ugh. Those are the worst.
I wish people could be more considerate on the road. Its so annoying.
Do you like your new city?
How do your friends feel about the situation?
What is the CPA exam?
I bet he must be extremely relieved and happy to have that exam behind him. Those exams can be extremely nerve wracking. Did he have longs periods of study time?
Oh no_comma_ that is scary!  Did his owner get control of him quickly?
Goodness_comma_ it was a good thing you were right there and able to usher them inside so quickly.  I can't imagine the results had you not been able to get to them quick enough!
the unknown gives me so much stress
it get so bad i get severe anxiety
Im sorry to hear that_comma_ Is he going to the doctor for help?
Oh wow it sounds like he is doing great_comma_ I hope he feels better soon!
I completely understand 
I feel for you and hope you have a way to manage it 
I bet! I would be so jealous_comma_ too! Maybe your neighbor will let you come over and swim?
That's a great way to look at it- take advantage of their investment for now- and then later you can have your own pool!
Wow! That is cool_comma_ do you spend a lot of time with him?
I hope you many more years of happy marriage!
Did everything turn out alright?
Hopefully they can work it out
I bet that was fun
Its nice to get a good sweat
That's no fun!  How long did they have you waiting?
Don't be too angry.  They might just have been swamped with prescriptions to fill.
It will be worth it though
I am sure you will be safe
Yeah_comma_ I don't think anyone likes going. How did it go?
I am glad you got the help you needed_comma_ and I hope you get better soon.
Ouch_comma_ are you alright?
I bet.  Did your work cover your medical bills?
oh yippeee! what kind of puppy?
i bet. dogs are amazing. we have a big ole mutt who is 75 lbs of lap dog love
Oh wow_comma_ that would be nice
It gives you something to work for
Yeah that's sad_comma_ I hope it found it's owner somehow.
Yeah_comma_ you can't always help everybody and everything though.
Try not to be.  Focus on yourself and your goals.  Use their judgmental looks to push you workout to the max!
I hope it helps!
Bosses are sometimes unaware it seems
I would hate working there
i have a pet rabbit. that makes me sad
sometimes on my way to work i find deer_comma_ skunk_comma_ cats_comma_ misc other dead animals and it makes me so sad
Why do you say that
Well that is what makes life fun
Wow that's super lucky! So you have no idea where it came from?
That's a true blessing. I am very happy for you!
That is so funny_comma_ but I know exactly how you feel.  Sometimes vacations can get too long.  Did you leave town?
That sounds like a heck of a trip!
That is good to hear.  Have you been ill for a while.  I hope not.
That's really to bad.  I hope the medicine works well and you are back to normal very soon!
i used to sit in 2 hours of traffic daily. no longer is that my problem
i love my slow country life
I believe that was me
Ha_comma_ well I still feel bad about it_comma_ I promise
nice talking to you for sure
You sound like you are going to do well then
I am glad it was easy for you
Aw_comma_ yeah I've been missing my Mom lately as well.
Hopefully your mom hasn't passed away_comma_ and you just haven't visited her in a while.
That is so crazy.  I love how Facebook reconnects people from so long ago.  Do you have any plans to meet up some time?
What has he been up to in the mean time?
Oh no! What happened?
That must be frustrating_comma_ but it really sounds like your trying to look at it in a positive light and that always makes things a little easier!
Uh oh. Was it bad?
Well at least it wasn't too bad...even if it was a little embarrassing.
Its nice to find good deals
I hope you have fun
That sounds so nice I'm jealous.
I definitely need to. Hope you can also continue to enjoy relaxing time.
How did you do
I am sorry
Aww_comma_ it's nice to relive those old memories sometimes.
Pictures are nice to have to be able to look back on life.
Kids can be annoying
Screaming is never good
What did you lie about?
Why did you lie about it?
I am a saints fan_comma_ so I am excited too ha
I read it today_comma_ he is a different kind of guy for sure
That is a great attitude to have.  I know it is hard to go through periods of struggle.  Do you have hope that things will get better soon?
That is phenomenal!  In hard times it is easy to distace ourselves from God_comma_ but I believe it is important to press in and cast our cares on Him.
Oh really? Actually I think that is a good thing. How's is going?
I think that's a good decision by your and your wife. And I think your wife's grandmother is going to recover well.
They will be good again
I am a saints fan though ha
What game was that?
Which teams played?
Well I hope they play well for you :)
It happens sometimes...I get fired up watching the Lakers play lol.
Is it all expenses paid?
Well_comma_ congrats on winning that?
My son really liked Pokemon too! He liked playing the card game and watching the show.
Yes_comma_ and I know there are still some fans around now too. Of course_comma_ they are more popular ones.
What kind of work is it
That does not sound fun at all
I know what you mean_comma_ hope it gets better!
I get that_comma_ here is to hoping it shows up soon!
Oh no_comma_ what happened?
That's unfortunate. I have missed them before too and I hate when that happens.
Oh wow! How lucky! Perfect timing.
I bet that was a huge relief.
Don't be jealous_comma_ instead_comma_ brush on your studying and start going to the gym.
Yeah_comma_ I do agree. Sometimes it seems like people are just plain blessed.

I get that_comma_ but things are still better for those around you_comma_ so it feels bad still
I don't follow football much.  Were they not the favored to win?
Oh wow.  Were you hoping the other team would win?
Oh_comma_ really? Kayaking is awesome! What a fun and adventurous person you must be. 
Hiking and kayaking? Wow! Better pack some trail mix.
I am sure it will get better
You just need to make a plan for yourself
oh_comma_ well that sucks! It can be very aggravating to spend time working on something_comma_ and then have it destroyed!
Yes_comma_ not only a waste of your time_comma_ but the money. No doubt_comma_ very frustrating_comma_ and I'm sure you wanted to teach the dog a lesson 
That's great that you have such trust in him.

Being busy always helps things

Sounds pretty interesting. I hope everything goes well for you.
Oh yeah? Did you get any good tips from him?
That's inspirational at least. I'm sure we can all do better at saving.

Hey_comma_ no problem. Just gotta lift heavier next time haha
I think that is normal_comma_ are you still friends
Oh well_comma_ you will find someone else
That is a nice way to wake up. Was it a good day?
That is really good. I am happy to hear that.
Are you excited to go back

Are you going out again?
I have felt that for sure in the past
It just gave me a positive feeling really
What made you feel that way?
I guess just make sure not to push it_comma_ there is a fine line between confidence and pride.
That is really nice.  What did you all do?
I love craft beer.  How many of you were ther?
That is so gross and rude
I guess that is a no
That's nothing to be depressed about. 
Start hanging out with friends and enjoy life.
Did you check the last place you had it?
Oh_comma_ that's lame. He should have checked for you.
I am sure you deserved some candy
You shouldnt_comma_ its nice to have some candy every once and awhile

That kind of stuff is always scary.  Do you have the results yet?
I am so glad to hear it!  Are you feeling better_comma_ though?
Do they have any idea what is going on?
I do too.  My wife has been very sick for the last 13 years and she just switched to a diet called Nutritarian and after three months is almost back to her old self.
Oh no! Is everything okay? What happened?
Wow_comma_ that first-time fire extinguisher purchase and replacement of the fire alarm batteries was definitely a blessing.
Its always nice to have that perspective

Good_comma_ friends are worth trying repeatedly for.

What traits do you have that make you think you're qualified for the job
Its nice to be prepared
I will have to start doing that
Its nice to have friends like that
Its nice to have people there for you always
I hate that. Especially at nighttime. It can be pretty scary.
Might have to sleep with the lights on next time it happens. Haha
Never a good thing_comma_ did she have a good reason or ask to reschedule?
That's not fun_comma_ but maybe it was for the best.
That must have been nice.  What did they make you?
Very nice.  Did you enjoy it?
Oh no_comma_ is it able to be saved
I am sorry that happened to you
Oh lord! I am glad you have something that is a healthy hobby
That's cool! It's always good to have a hobby
Do you have an example?
That is never fun_comma_ I always return the favor
I don't like gory movies but scary ones I do. I used to be the same way as you_comma_ though.
I won't either haha just not my thing! 
Ah_comma_ maybe it will look up for you. She could still call?
Well_comma_ even if she doesn't you could always be straight-forward with her and just ask her if she's not into you then let you know so you can move on.
Just thinking positive thoughts
Its good to have faith
Ok_comma_ if that's what you decide to do I believe you have had time to think it through 
Ok_comma_ the most important thing is that you have a source that pays for the bills
Connecting with the people that mattered the most makes me super excited
Oh_comma_ I bet that is going to be fun
I hope you have fun then
Very nice. The weather should be perfect.
Drink a few beers and have a hotdog for me. Should be fun.

I had a similar problem where my car overheated in the middle of nowhere.. so you never know.. anything can happen
Was it something good or bad?
No way... Bigfoot himself?
It's okay... I believe you. The truth is out there.
I would be too!
Who knows_comma_ maybe you'll win

i hope you have fun!
Why? What happened? I hope it was nothing really bad.
Oh no! Did you ever find your dog?

That would be great! So many towns also have some great food banks too! We should always help eachother out
Why is it hard for you?
Well_comma_ that's really great of you to be the bigger person in such a situation.

I wish my sister felt that way about mine! lol. What kind of pets does she have?
They are very curious creatures. Very people friendly. What is their name?

I am sure you will.. You seem to have studied hard last semester.
I failed a huge test last week.. for my English 6-12 certification
Wow. My hearty congratulations to you!
Yeah_comma_ It is a proud moment.
oh no. im sure it was an accident. is he young?
i would have been upset for both reasons. especially after just having it cleaned
what happened?
Always gotta have a spare
thats wonderful .. hope they continue to progress
yea thats understandable
What will you be doing this weekend/
Don't club any seals :)
Wow_comma_ that sounds very dangerous. Were you afraid?
I totally feel. Gotta hate those jerks that are always cutting people off!
Thats disturbing!
lol. Well I hope you had a car? Also I hope you got better friends
yea? whats the matter?
yea that part sucks
I hope you do. IS there a big pay raise
I don't know if that's good or not lol
did they catch you?
at least they didnt get you then!
How did that happen?
That is the worst_comma_ I hate that.
That's no good_comma_ why didn't you bring a friend with you?
I'm sorry that happened. You deserve better friends than them anyway.
Oh boy_comma_ sounds like a terrible time! Did you drink water?
That's great that you got it repaired. Else your house would've been a sauna.
my dad used to play hand ball.it was very fun and interesting watching them play when i was a kid
yeah.it needs more exposure
Oh man that is the worst feeling. Did you have to wash the dishes?
Well at least you didn't have to walk out without paying. Good decision.
That sounds lonely. Why did you go alone?
That is really messed up. Was it at least a good movie?
That really sucks. Did you get in trouble?
Awwww_comma_ that's terrible. I hope you find him!
Are you going to be able to get that money?
I hope everything works out for you.
Are you having desperate times?
I think you need to go and talk to someone_comma_ your pastor may be the best place to start.
I hear you! I am in that boat too! It can be very hard to be alone a lot
Those are NOT friends
What savages! Did you tell the drive through guy?
I'm not sure_comma_ but I'm not liking where society is heading these days.
did you rub his nose in it
teach him a lesson!
I would be mad too. Did you find the culprit?
That really sucks. Are you going to get it fixed?
wow that's great!
I hate when that happens... so many channels_comma_ nothing to watch
Where are you going
That sounds fun
Oh_comma_ that's so cool!
That's a smart kid!
That sucks. Did you catch the culprit?
I would be too! Did you buy a new one?
run!
grab your gun and take names.
sounds like you were pretty well prepared.  howd it go?
Awesome.  Great job.  What kind of job is it?
happy early birthday!
ARe you going to have a party?
That's no good. Did he ever repay you?
What a jerk. I would take it to Judge Judy.
That seems like a nice memory
IT's nice remembering the good times
Awwww_comma_ that's sad. Why is it your last day?
Well_comma_ I suppose it'll be a different experience. I am sure you'll meet a bunch of new cool people.
I've never been there_comma_ did you enjoy it?
I think I need to go there_comma_ everyone seems to love it.
I feel sorry for your friend.
That is such a terrible story.
That really sucks. Sounds like a regular ole Fidel Castro.
True. Kids always get up to no good at night!
oopsie!
MAybe she is sick
Do you honk your horn at them?
That is true. It is always better to be safe than sorry.
what movie did you see?
was it good? ive been wanting to check it out
That sounds horrible... I'm sorry that happened to you
Ew no way! Lol
Nice! What are you planning on doing?
Sounds like the ultimate plan to me. I think I will do the same.
What was the instance? Something bad or good?
Whoa that is not cool. I would be so ticked off.
Did he turn around there and go and pick that on up?
You should inform the local police_comma_ they will definately pick that person up!
Did you punish your dog?
That's good.  Your dog will learn.
Nice! What color is it?
Yeah_comma_ they aren't too hard to put together. They're really fun too!
Oh no!  Is it a puppy or perhaps sick?
Perhaps she had an upset tummy or something.  Sometimes with dogs it's hard to tell.
That sounds like fun! Where are you taking them? The junkyard?
Aw_comma_ that's sounds like so much fun! You sound like awesome parents :)
I love Madden_comma_ I can't wait to play it!
I am so jealous!
whoa_comma_ is the other woman more attractive?
how long have you been married?
MY crocodile always does that 
Get a prosthetic. I cant spell
What a tragedy! Did anyone say anything about it?
I am sure you did_comma_ but at least you don't look crazy every day like I do.
HAHA that sounds just like my husband!
Well sometimes men tend to get lost in their video game world
That's awesome! You must be a hard worker to be so confident!
Oh well in that case_comma_ I'm sure you'll get it! He must have confidence in you too.
I am sure you will do well!
Just stay positive and everything will work out.
How do you think you did on it?
I am sure you did fine on it. And besides_comma_ if you did poorly_comma_ there is always the good ole local McDonalds.
I can understand that - I think all of us_comma_ at one point or another_comma_ did something we were ashamed of.  
I know that feeling_comma_ kinda sick to your stomach can't get it out of your head kinda thing.  We all have to have a method to overcome it and move on.
Aw_comma_ that's nice. Did they get along?
Oh god_comma_ that is horrifying! I would've wanted to hide under a rock too!
I know what you mean_comma_ I long for the day when mine grow up and go away to college.
They can be rambunctious_comma_ mine drive me up the wall sometimes.
i know that feeling
Im sorry. It will happen til someone else soon enough
Oh man! Which one was it?
I saw that movie too! One of the scariest I have ever seen.
Are you prepared for it?
Absolutely_comma_ that's the spirit!
Aw_comma_ why is that? Is it acting up?
Why is that? The military isn't so bad. The pay is really nice if you stick around for a bit.
How do you think you are going to do?
I am confident you will do well!
Well that's great! Has she practiced enough to get her actual license?
Oh yes_comma_ definitely. It's OTHER drivers you have to watch out for. People halfway pay attention to what they're doing on the road!
That was very nice of you!  I wish more people would react the way that you did.
And that's all we really can do honestly_comma_ if more people did that this world would be a better place all around.
I love pecan pie. My grandma used to make it
They can make their own pies
Yeah I know how that is. My kids eat me out of house and home.
Well kids do need to eat. They grow up so quickly.
That sounds revolting! What did you do?
Poor frog. May it rest in peace. I will pray for it tonight.
Are you going to get a new one?
Do you live near the Rockies?
That is good of you to support her.
You have a great family!
That is just gross!  Did you say anything to him_comma_ like "Dude_comma_ what are you doing?"
Well_comma_ if you've ever seen Friends_comma_ Rachel makes a trifle with whipped cream_comma_ bananas_comma_ jam_comma_ and ground beef and peas!!
Is there some good news?
That is such a heartwarming story!
Do you feel as prepared as you can be for it?
Well that is a great attitude_comma_ I bet you will do amazing!!
Oh no! That's terrible
How did it even rollaway if its that huge?
Oh yeah? That's pretty nice that you would help her out like that.
Wow_comma_ that would make me mad too. What a devious scamp!
That is really sad and devastating. 
I am glad to hear he is doing better. 
thats great i hope you get it !
Money is always good_comma_ and you will be near your son hopefully he does not find it embarrassing _comma_ u know how kids are    
Damn you are the MVP. I have only eaten two in a day. I am jealous.
Well maybe they should think about emigrating south. I heard the charter schools there are subpar.
Well_comma_ kids eventually grow and become independent. Maybe you can try and go fishing with them or something? Or a family picnic?
That would work too! Or maybe a good meal?
That's really not good. Did you feel bad about it?
Maybe you should see a counselor. Or just get out of the relationship.
So what did you do? Did you confront him?
I can't find words to describe my laughter right now. You are the best
What did you do for you?
That is such a bold move to make.  Congratulations!
Do you enjoy cooking for others or for the event you are taking it to?
I bet it will be great - I've always loved a good tuna casserole!
That's fantastic! Was anyone around to witness the glory?
You deserve a purple heart for the bravery you showed today.
That's awesome_comma_ congratulations!
You must be so proud of her
That would scare the heck out of me! How did you find out what it was?
What a crazy night! I bet you didn't get much sleep.
Is your dog still a puppy?
I'm sure she will grow out of it.
Oh wow. What for?
I would hope so. That was a very generous gesture on your part.
That's so nice! Did they have a good day?
That's good. It's nice when everything turns out great in the end.
wow. in the middle of the week. you mustve really been surprised
Cool.
Oh wow! Congratulations! How much did you pay for the ticket?
Oh wow! I bet you'll have that $99 in no time so you can buy another! Good job!
Friggin Becky! Why would she do such a thing!
Yeah! Get even and slap that jerk in the face with the shoes she bought!
Oh that's terrible. Is he okay?
That's bad_comma_ but really good that he is fine! I am very glad for both you and him.
Eww!  I hope you were able to miss it and not drive over it
Yeah_comma_ I certainly do not envy the person that has to clean those things up!  
congratulations. what are you having?
i have two girls and a boy
Wow that is so nice!
How old is she?
Why? What was the problem?
I had the same problem.
That's a responsible decision on your part. Are you nervous about it?
That's good. I am sure he will turn out happy and healthy!
That really sucks. Did you find it?
That's really good! Was all your money in there?
Okay. are you preparing now?
Don't worry. You can do well. Hope you score well.
Oh wow. Did everything turn out okay?
Well I am so glad it turned out okay! Especially since your daughter is healthy and kicking. Congrats :)
Wow_comma_ how exciting!!  It's been a long time since I've had a birthday party - are you going anywhere special?
OOOO I love gifts!!!  I know it's never "about the gift" but ok_comma_ it is SO nice to get presents!!
While I understand the motives behind your deception_comma_ I must caution that it may catch up with you one day. How did you do it?
That's OK. Everyone makes mistakes_comma_ just study hard and don't do it again in the future.
was it on a scratch off?
thats awesome! i need some of that luck
Oh cool_comma_ for what console?
Yes_comma_ but for Xbox one.
Oh no_comma_ I hope she wasn't your ride homw
That's happened to me before... not fun
Oh cool! Where are you guys going?
That sounds like fun! Beach days are the best days!
How do you feel about that?
Do you think you will tell the professor/teacher about it?
Oh geez. Did you get any tears in your eye?
Awww_comma_ that's so sweet. I remember when my little girl was taking tap dance classes. So precious!
You have a pet armadillo?
I hope it gets potty trained.
Nice! Have you gone cruising in it yet?
I would be too. That's a nice car!
Congratulations! Have you decided on a name yet?
That sounds wonderful. I'm happy for you and your new daughter!
Aww I'm sorry for your loss. How is your family holding up?
Yeah it sounds like she did take advantage. That's a cruel thing to do.
I love pickles and I always order extra!  We must be twins!
6?? How is that EXTRA?  12 - that would be extra - crazy!!!
It seems like a nice way to relax
I will try that when the weather is cooler
That really sucks. Maybe you should force feed him some melatonin?
Oh_comma_ well hopefully that works. Wouldn't want you up all night!
Nice_comma_ what was the occasion?
That is a great thing. I wish I had a girlfriend like that.
That's really terrible. Are you going to get a new one?
That's a good idea. Or I would adopt one. I adopted two from PetsMart and it only cost me 15 bucks!
I'm sorry_comma_ does that happen often?
I hope they treat you better in the future.
Oh no! What did you do? Are you going to dispute it?
Well that's a relief! Wouldn't want the IRS to seize your house!
I've never used one.  How did it work out for you?
I can understand that!  It's crazy how scary things can be out there now -and the news does not help at all!  But I'm glad you are safe!!
I love horses! Has she been riding a long time?
Oh no! I'm glad she was okay!
did you get to try some good food?
what was it?
Oh_comma_ which series is it?
Good. I hope you enjoy the game and play well.
Oh no! I'm sure it didn't do it on purpose
Poor parrot
Nice! If it pays more_comma_ then why wouldn't you take it?
Gotta put up with some discomfort to make dat bank.
monsters under the bed?
I used to believe they were in my closet too
Oh yeah? When are you heading over?
Yeah_comma_ I guess it is kinda jerkish of them. I would give the ole copparoos a call so you can get some sleep.
That is such a bizarre story.
I hope it gets resolved.
wow_comma_ who sent it to you?
wow_comma_ you
thats really nice_comma_ are yall friends?
oh i know the feeling. its good they are down to earth though
That has always bothered me as well.  I mean_comma_ how much effort does it take to just wave as a thank you?
People do not seem to have much of it these days unfortunately.  I promise if you ever let me out_comma_ I'll wave.
That sounds so cool! Did you find any good ones?
That's so nice. Any in particular that you liked?
Woo good luck!
It's good you studied!
I love fried twinkies_comma_ you will too!
I am so excited for you!
did you do it bare foot ? that is nasty i dont own pets at all but i can imagine your situation 
its really stinky i have smelled it before 
Oh no! I bet it was a huge poop! What did you do with it?
Well that's what he gets for pooping on the rug! He knew better!
That sounds like a very fond memory that brings back a lot of nostalgia. Where would he take you?
That sound so relaxing. I wish I had parents to do that with.
lol how did the guests react?
thats embarrassing! gotta love pets
Madden is a fun game/ My husband plays it a lot instead of paying attention to me.
See_comma_ you know what's up! I need you to hang out with my husband so it'll rub off on him!
Dang! Did the guy get hurt?
Almost makes me want to become the next Steve Irwin. I'd be better than him because there ain't no way that I would let a stupid stingray end my life!
You have a lemur as a pet?
I am sorry about your situation.
What does she do that's so bad?
Yeah_comma_ she sounds terrible.
I don't blame you.  I don't like giving out money like that - you just never know what they may do with it.
Well_comma_ like I said_comma_ you couldn't be sure that she would use it in a good way.  She could have bought alcohol_comma_ etc.. with it.  What I usually do is if they are asking for money for food_comma_ I will go and buy them a meal or go get them some groceries that aren't perishable.
Did you have fun at least?
Oh I'm sorry to hear that
That's great! Is it a boy or a girl?
That's so nice! What are you going to name her?
Well I think you're gonna do a great job on it
You got this homie! I bet you're gonna get an A!
Awww_comma_ poor dog! Did you give it a treat to make it up?
Well_comma_ I am sure he can tell you're sorry by your actions. Doggies are smart like that!
Oh cool_comma_ what's in it?
Ah man_comma_ I built my own computer about a year ago...it had like 10 important_comma_ expensive parts_comma_ and I had to wait for them all!
That is an awesome phone!
If you have a tracking number you should be okay.
Well you're a good man. Not many of yall out there these days.
Exactly. I still have hope for a new generation of nice guys to come along one day.
lmao how the heck did that happen
oh man i am sorry to hear that! hopefully you find him!
Oh Im so sorry to hear that
Were you close?
thats awesome! what kind of contest?
free money is always great!
I hate when that happens! What did you do?
Well_comma_ I hope it doesn't happen again. And I hope you find out who did it and give them an earful!
Congratulations!  I am so happy for you!
That will be quite an adventure!
That's a dang shame. Have you said anything to him about it?
That would boil my blood. You just gotta smack him upside the head!
shame on him. How did you find out?
Did he receive a failing grade?
That's too bad. Why do you think she is doing that?
Those dastardly kids! I hope she grows out of it eventually.
I've been there before!  Do you ever remember the stuff that you do?
Oh no!  I hope it wasn't too embarrasing!
i want kids too _comma_ and im getting pretty old _comma_ how old are you guys ???
dang im 31 i wish u the best 
wow that is an awesome gift!!
I bet you'll have a great time
Do you think you will get it?
That's wonderful! I'm sure you are an excellent candidate!
That's great that you have so much confidence.  What classes do you have?
Those easy semesters help when you know you've got some harder ones on the horizon.  Good Luck!
thats terrible
how did your daughter take it
I bet they are! You're a lucky man!
It is. Mine are all grown now and it's like they grow up right before your eyes in a blink.
awesome! what kind?
whoa that is an awesome ride! what color?
Does she compensate you or anything like that?
Will she not repay the favor at all?
Did he get it?
Well at least it wasnt all for nothing
I am sorry to hear that.
You should hire someone to do that.
Do you think they will return it if they borrow it?
I wouldn't let them borrow it. Who has time for all that?
Oh my heavens_comma_ how long ago was that?
It's cool that you experienced that. I love going to the movies!
Oh no I'm so sorry. I love cats
At least the cat lived a good life by your side
work is such a drag. the time we lose from it we never get back
people are just like that. our childhood is gone and we have to fend for ourselves now
I hear thats an amazing show but I've never seen it before
They sound really scary_comma_ I hope I never see one!
it will. i hope i am long gone
maybe i will be a zombie!
awww. boy or girl
Well a happy healthy baby is the best kind
I know what you mean_comma_ I love it so much. Who's your favorite character?
I'm #teamjonsnow til the bitter end!
My parents had difficulties conceiving as well. What happened in the end?
That's so good to hear! I am actually adopted myself_comma_ and I love my family so much.
Why ddi it need to rain today?
Was the weather nice instead?
What is your favorite show?
Maybe you should watch some Netflix.
Has he done something to make you want to break up with him?
Well_comma_ if you know he's not the one_comma_ it's better to do it now than years from now.
what is that?
sounds awful
I have never seen that show but I have heard of it.
I do not watch a lot of TV.
i've been there lol
thats too far away
Raising children is hard_comma_ to say the least. What did she lie about most recently?
Well that's a relief. It actually sounds fairly amusing!
Oh no!  Did you call your bank and file a fraud charge?
At least you stopped it at $100.  I've heard of others that have lost thousands until the bank could recover it for them.
That is such a noble gesture!
They will promote you someday_comma_ don't give up.
It can be scary out there alone.
That's too bad. I hope things turn around for you soon.
is that good or bad?
well_comma_ as long as you're happy
Who is conducting the tests?
How long does the test take?
You and me both
tell me about it
Does it bring back memories?
That is so sweet.
wow. thats amazing
I am shocked either way.
i know right
now that summer break is over_comma_ every week will be like that for me
Oh really? What's bothering you about it?
Ah_comma_ that is different. I can't remember a time in school that I didn't have a backpack on me.
Wow! What did you eat and how much did you spend?
I am sure it was excellent and not raw!
You are
i had one parent like that
What did they do for you to hate them?
Have you ever tried to use UPS?
I am sure you feel better now that you did it.
Yes and now you can cook without germs.
That feeling is not alien to me. Had been through it in the past. It is truly frustrating looking for new favorite restaurant
I hope you would be able to find a new one as a replacement for your favorite dining place
What kind of restaurant?
Oh_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that.
how exciting
what are you guys going to do?
That's interesting. What kind of weird things?
What a wacko! I hope she grew out of it.
I love meeting new people.
Have you ever talked to a doctor about it?
are you gonna stay there for ever
that seems like a long time
I love taco bell_comma_ what did you get?
I always get a bean burrito.
That sounds so exciting!
I wish you the best of luck!
I have a daughter but she isn't married (yet). 
That's nice but I wonder if it was expensive.  My daughter is one of these millennials that opt for a live-in partner. 
I had a blast in high school. I wish I could go back.
Too bad we couldn't use a time machine.
I really hate that too. It just hurts.
Same here. It's better in the long run if you don't I believe.
That is great. Did you buy him a present for graduation?
What did your brother study?
Why did you do that?
I hope you had fun at least.
Was your friend drunk?
Have you spoke to him since?
sounds like fun
Hey call of duty bets starts tomorrow for xbox
I am also single. I love it.
Were you ever married in the past?
Well trying to compare yourself to the former president is a bit of a jump
Thats fair. Maybe some acting classes would help you loosen up.
That must of been horrible.
I do not drink alcohol at all.
what did they do?
Ive vream works wonders
That is a very bold move.
I'm sorry to hear that.
That's a real shame! You going to do anything about it?
I would feel the same way. I hope it gets taken care of.
I love Nintendo. What game did you play?
I love Super Mario.
Me neither. I get very tense at those times. Were you in one recently?
Oh no that's horrible. I bet that was a scary experience.
wow_comma_ what makes them happy?
aha_comma_ let them have fun
How many did the dog have?
Are you going to keep all of them?
Oh congrats! When is the due date?
That is coming up soon!
Well you know how kids are. Probably just forgot and was embarrassed 
Well be gentle but firm. Too much and you will scare her more then likely. 
Trust me_comma_ she probably already knows she made the mistake. Just teach her not to do it again.
What happened on the date
A pro game?
oh thats nothing
Did you keep it or try to find the owner?
Did you spend it yet?
I'm so sorry to hear that.
No_comma_ you will never be alone.
What kind of card game was it? I am not even good enough to cheat most of the time.
Ah yes I have_comma_ but it has been a while. 
What is making you feel bummed out?
Can you do anything fun inside?
Do you know who it was?
Did you call the police?
I hope you do!
Confidence is the golden key to success.
Hey_comma_ socks are fair game_comma_  cant be mad about socks.
Yeah  guess thats true_comma_  But im always running out of socks.
Did you at least get it back?
Did you have to fight anyone for it?
that sucks_comma_ why did you do it?
that is such a bomber_comma_ i can relate to thinking you are right but then turning out top be wrong
Where are you going on your road trip?
I love Denver_comma_ I go every summer.
He stole your car!! did you call the cops?
Good_comma_ Did he actually come back with it though.
What was he doing in there?
How old is your brother?
Yes! love is an amazingly powerful thing.
That is amazing_comma_ I truly hope that happens.  you deserve it.
Oh_comma_ Did you check what's it?
Yeah_comma_ It's better to ignore.
Yes! more money_comma_ more fun right!
Oh really?!?!? why is that?
There really is nothing sweeter than childhood memories. Have you ever been back to that park?
I am so sorry to hear that. I hope he gets better!
Youre a monstor!
I cant lie_comma_ I have done worse before.
Is your puppy still around?
That sucks_comma_ did you ever find him?
Yes he will! your support is probably very important to him.
Amazing_comma_ He will pull through with the right amount of support.
What trick did you teach him?
That is good_comma_ do you plan to teach him more tricks?
do you feel confortable in the new contry? maybe you should download an app to meat people
i can understand my work does not allow me to do much as well
Yes! did you help her study?!
Thats amazing_comma_ you are probably the best teacher she could have asked for.
Did you do it?
Was the water cold or hot?
Taylor swift is actually amazing_comma_ she is my guilty pleasure.
Yes! I think she is coming to my city soon!
What were the pictures of?
How long ago was this?
Haha I'd say so. What was your excuse to her?
That's a good strategy always when dealing with wives I think.
Yes! what was it!??!
Bluetooth speakers are actually one of my favorite inventions.
Why?? what happened to her!?
That is so terrible! was this recent? if you dont mind me asking
Did you go see a doctor?
How long will it take to get rid of the fungus?
That's fantastic. How did you do?
Congratulations! Sounds like your hard work really paid off!
Really? did something trigger this?!?
Do you get sick very often!?
When are you going to look?
Hopefully you did well. How many classes did you have?
Why did she leave?
Did you Dad stick around?
But did you ebd up getting a good grade?
I mean_comma_ sometimes you have to do what you have to do.
Why not?!! is he mean to you?
That is terrible_comma_ Yard work is mild torture.
Why is that? Do you not like the train?
Have you ever tried to distract yourself while on the train?
Did the dog look like he was having fun?
Did you take a video of it?
Thats amazing_comma_ who bought it for you?
Thats amazing_comma_ getting a new car can change your life!
that sucks is she really your friend then?
but still if she is only using you i dont think she is some one you need to be around just saying
The evidence of what?
Did you get in trouble with anyone?
Me to! cowbays all day baby.
Why not!?! americas team!
It is good to have a open relationship with your parents.
Do you have the same relationship with your Dad?
Yes you will! I believe in you!
Hahaha! me too! i cant even trust an alarm.
You've got me on the edge of my seat. What did you do?
I'm so sorry to hear that! I hope you two can work it out.
That's great. Where are you going?
Good for you buddy!
Thats the spirit! you can do It I know you can
What are you studying?
How does that make you feel?!
Have you ever thought he's chirping because he doesn't want to be caged up? Maybe she wants to be out with you. 
Thats amazing! are you ready for your journey>
No I dont I really want to one day_comma_ I think i would be good at it.
Oh that's horrible. Were you okay?
Yes that's the most important part. You were lucky!
Awe thats so sweet! how long have you worked there?

You thought? what was really happeneing>
LOL I honestly would have been screaming

You can have someone watch with you next time
What kind of classes have you taken?
That's great that you are learning a martial art and blowing off steam at the same time!
Did she taught him to use the bathroom?
Did it made a mess?
Thank goodness! I hope he was not hurt too bad?
Yes_comma_ I can only imagine! Thank goodness he wasn't and that he will be ok!
What happened? Was it the dog?
I knew it. Nasty. lol. It's happened to me too
wow_comma_ thats awesome
yah_comma_ truly hard work pays
Wow_comma_good for you. It seems greater things are lined up for you.
That shows someone is looking up for some of your interest. Maybe next could be a promotion.How knows??
Oh I'm sorry. That must suck. Any second choice?
I'm sure you'll get in
I did_comma_ but not officially_comma_ and it was a trail running marathon(16 miles)_comma_ how about you?
You are the only one who know answer to that.
hahaha..that is too funny. did anyone else hear?
wow! it happens. i have heard it before
Oh_comma_ that sounds amazing_comma_ was it a good thing?
What a nice girlfriend you have_comma_ did you liked them?
I am sorry to hear that_comma_ what were they doing with the money?
I bet you were very angry with them over this.
Were you in a rock band than?
I bet it was fun_comma_ how is your hearing now?
They love you don't they?
I see. So you miss them. Call them?
What good news! You must be very proud of her.
That's great that you can celebrate her success so wholeheartedly! You are a good sibling.
That sounds scary. I couldn't sleep with that.
Perhaps it's deer? That's what it's been in my experience.
OMG. Did anyone else notice?
lol. Well perhaps you got away with it this time
why is that? they are not real! 
that is the point! haha
That can be pretty lonely I bet. Are you going to have another roommate then?
I see. Maybe having some private time will be a benefit if you look on the brighter side of it.
Do you play?
If you have a favorite team_comma_ I hope they have a good season! 
Don't you worry_comma_ your tomorrow might be great. Just take it each day at a time.
They say problems shared is halved solved. I wish you the very best. Remember never give up in life.
how did it go?
i hope you get the job!
Oh I hate wasps. Did you get it out?
I'd get some spray or a flyswatter and prepare for battle.
Amazing! Congratulations. Was it fun?
I love parties
oh my! does she know it is broken?
it wasn't intentional ....still a horrible feeling
Oh my_comma_ I am sorry to hear that. are you angry at her?
I agree_comma_ you have done the right thing. I hope you find someone alot better than her.
Well that's intriguing. What was in it? 
What an unexpected treat! I bet it really made your day!
What kind of job do you want?
You and me both! Nothing wrong with making some more bread!
Congratulations! What position are you interviewing for?
Not just working for yourself_comma_ but helping others too. Good on you!
Thats nice of you. It means he can get back on his feet.
It's good to have a fixed address too for mail etc. Well done - I'm proud of you.
was it a real disaster or just seem like one?
hahah.. sounds bad
Nice_comma_ are you looking forward to it?
Its always a good idea to enjoy the outdoors. So have fun!
So sad.Make a call to her and speak.
It's good idea. Take care both of you!
im sorry to hear that. what was the job?
i love those type of jobs
Did anyone notice?
Maybe it's Karma - you deserved free soda
Oh that will be fun I'm sure! What is your favorite part of camping?
That is wonderful! Y'all should build a fire and roast some marshmallows! My family would always do that while singing songs. 
You must have really impressed the company you work for. Got any plans for the money?
Either of those choices sounds good. Enjoy the fruits of your labor!
oh man!! tell me about it. that is the thing i hate the most also!
i dont blame you.i also feel like telling them something. but i hold my tongue
What did he make?
Thats great! Did he enjoy doing it?
oh god_comma_ what are you going to do now?
good luck with that! 
Im jealous! That must have put you in a good mood. Its cloudy and rainy over this way. 
I stay optimistic. You seem motivated or excited for some reason.
A true American right of passage. How does the memory make you feel?
Cheers from across the pond! It truly is a magical place.
What did he give you/
Sounds fun_comma_ I love sushi.
i'm glad you enjoyed it _comma_ what did you have?
that sounds really good
Oh wow. Did you have butterflied in your stomach! 
I bet you were excited to find out!
Probably just some bored teens. Still_comma_ what a mess to clean up!
Sounds like you are going to have a stake out. Good luck!
It's stressful - how did you get on?
Well done!
when does it start?
you must be really excited
Nice. Is there a special occasion?
Good. A haircut always makes me feel more confident
Sounds like a great day to relax then! What will you do?
Nice_comma_ you should just snuggle in and binge your favorite tv shows.
I'm so sorry! I bet you were terrified! What happend?
Yeah I hope everything turned out ok. That's worrisome to me. 
How are you feeling about the interview?
What is the job?
Thats inconsiderate. Have you spoken to her about it yet?
Maybe you need to do the same to get even with her
How come? What made you so angry.
Ugh I dislike parents who are so irresponsible with their kids in public
I'm sure you'll be fine. Sell yourself.
I'm sure that will help. I have confidence in you.
what was on it
oh that sounds nice
Why? Is it a dangerous area?
Yeah - that can be frightening
Oh man! Are you gonna be ok? I hope your not devastated about this. 
Wow. You need to go see the doctor to help you get some rest. I bet your exhausted. 
what do you plan to do about it?
thats a good plan
Me too. What are your plans?
Cool. I might do that too
Why? What do you have on?
Lol - peace and quiet?
how did it get in?
oh thats crazy
Are you frusterated with the old one or just hopeful for a new begining?
I bet you are very worried or anxious. Do you need any help with anything?
that stinks.
i can see that!
Nice_comma_ did you feel caring since you did so well?
You should take care of the pet more often in the future.
Are you? Have you applied to a lot of place?
Good_comma_ I hope you land one soon!
Oh no! What happened?
No wonder
you must have enjoyed yourself
am happy you did
Good - it's always best to be prepared. Are you confident?
I hope so!
Nice_comma_ you must be really anticipating it. Which soccer league will you watch?
Sounds good_comma_ today I'll be watching my favorite team play. I am also anticipating the match.
Yes_comma_ they take on Leicester City
Oh my_comma_ do you feel content with all that sugar in your body?
Its okay_comma_ you should treat yourself every now and then!
It's hard. But you will see him soon and nowadays tehre are lots of ways to communicate
Soon you'll remember all the mess he made or food he ate and be a little bit glad :-)
i bet you were frustrated with them. Did you confront them?
I agree. Im sorry for that. I hope they didnt get you too sad. Maybe they thought it wsa theirs for some reason
I agree. Go talk to them and express your frusteration and anger with them. Maybe he will get it. 
Oh no! Did it attack you?
You can always call an exterminator. They should be able to take care of it.
Excellent!I love parties
I hope so - good luck
whats the appointment for
ah i hope it goes well!
Oh no! Do you know who did it?
Wow I would be upset too if I were you.
That's exciting! Do you have a favorite team?
Cool. That sounds exciting. I hope they do well this year!
Really??!!? Can you lend me some money?
Neither am I. Well done! Remember your friends (like me)
put it on offerup
i can understand that
I would be too. What was the hold up for?
I see_comma_ you should try yoga to relieve the stress. 
That must've been nice. I've never been.
I'm sure it is. Maybe I'll visit too
Oh no. What happened?
Realy?! What did you do?
Good job! you must be so proud of yourself.
Hey_comma_ if you're passionate about it_comma_ then go for it!
Wow that's terrifying_comma_ maybe next time u should invest in mouse traps 
Understandable_comma_ that's very unfortunate hopefully they will disappear from your home 
Congrats! That would be pretty exciting. Do you have any plans for it?
That sounds like a good plan. How big is your garden?
Nice! How do you pick your numbers?
That's cool. Good luck with your ticket!
what movie was it
oh yea that was creepy
Oh no. Was it an important meeting?
I'm sure it's not as bad as you think
Sorry to hear that. It must make you feel very lonely 
I suppose there has to be a balance of both. To enjoy solitude and the company of others.
Interesting. What was in it?
Cool! Did you eat all of it yet?
Nice. I wish someone would send me a package like that!
Cool! I'd love to be patient like that
Well done to her. I  hope she enjoys the reward
time fof a beat down?
thats cool
Nice_comma_ what pet was it?
Sounds very exquisite. You must have cared for it well.
That would be very scary! Were you able to find some clothes?
That's probably the best solution to the problem.
Did you manage to make it on time?
Good job! It must have been stressful.
Have you prepared well for it?
Nice_comma_ be sure to shave and be confident!
Yeah -  get that sometimes too
True
I see_comma_ do you think you will get the job?
Good_comma_ you must have prepared well for it.
Really? Was it a ghost?
Phew!
It's lovely. Why did you take care?
Oh_comma_ it's good that you take care of them.
oh nice
well that stinks for you but good for him
im glad to hear that!!! hard work pays off!!
im very proud of you and the hard work you put in
I don't think you should. Those are often scams.
Usually if you feel that way it is. Try to research alternate cures that actually will work better.
Wow_comma_ did it scare you?!
So am I_comma_ I would have freaked out if I saw it my bedroom.
I don't mind that - does it freak you out
But you survived.
Yeah - the prices vary a lot
I'm not sure. I think it depends on the dates you want
No_comma_ I've never been there either.
I just Googled it. It does seem beautiful online. Maybe that could be next year's trip!
thats awesome
as you should 
sounds like a pain! Do you know who did it?
Hm_comma_ I hope its not too costly to fixed!
That sucks! I'm sure it hurt your feelings.
Oh_comma_ wow. I can't believe your friend did that to you. 
I'm sure it can be. Maybe talk to him about it.
Did it wake you up? I would have been so scared.
Ha! Just next time_comma_ make sure you close all the windows before going to bed!
Oh no. Was it a important speech?
As King Solomon in the bible would say "This will pass"
Oh sad. What did happen?
He shouldn't do this. Is that your dog fine now?
what was it
thats cool
That's really disgusting. I'm sorry to hear that.
Well hopefully you'll be able to get the puppy trained pretty soon.
that is awesome! goes to show that hard work DOES pay off!! congrats!
that type of news makes me really happy
Good luck! I hope you find something good!
How have you been searching?
Very admirable
I'm sue she'll get over it. Your wife wouldn't.
Congratulations! What is he going to do now?
Amazing.
That must be lonely. Do you try to make friends?
I am sorry to hear that. Luckily you can always call them.
Yeah. It's tough sometimes. But maybe taught her a valuable lesson?
Oh  dear.
what type of job you looking for ?
cool
Really? That's awful. Hopefully they understand taht you weren't really yourself.
Don't be too hard on yourself. Everyone makes mistakes.
Sorry to hear that. Were they busy or did they forget?
You should not rely on her next  time. She seems unreliable! 
Wow_comma_ you must have been so surprised! Your parents are so nice.
Well its a nice shock! I wish someone would give me a surprise for once!
I'm very sorry to hear that. I'm hear for you if you need someone.
I can understand the feeling. But being single is great that you don't have to constantly worry about someone else.
hahaha...ive been there and i have done that...what kind of cookies?
ohhh...fancy i dont blame you then. i would have eaten them all too
Congratulations! You must be very happy. Have you met him yet?
Does he have a name?
That sounds exciting! Will you be meeting your old friends there?
Really? That would be pretty fun. I've never heard about my high school having a reunion.
Oh no that's horrible. Did he even ask?
That's awful. I'm sorry that happened to you. Maybe karma will come around on your boss.
What was in the parcel?
That sounds delicious! I wish someone would send me a package like that.
Wow - I've nver been but would love to go.
Definitely. And it never rains in Southern CAlifornia.
How come?
I see_comma_ I feel like that sometimes too when my kids leave for college. 
did he do anything?
probably did the wrong thing.. up to no good.
Excellent. How's it been going?
Great - I'm glad
Do you play soccer or watch it on television?
Do you have a favorite team?
Really? What sort of package are you expecting>?
Oh that sounds like fun!
i would have been fine with that grade too. are you doing well in the class?
i can relate to that. all that matters is you passed
That's very exciting. Have you decided to get one for sure?
Yes_comma_ its good to be prepared. I'm sure when you do get one_comma_ he will become a part of the family.
Oh wow! How were they?
Guess you won't be hungry for while
Oh no - how embarrassing. What did you do?
Phew!
oh no.. is she ok ?
i hope all goes well
That's great! Dod you have any plans for the weekend?
Oh that's horrible. You can always watch a movie or something indoors.
thats awesome!
hard work pays off 
Cool! That's great news. Do you have any fun plans?
Sounds like fun! I'd love to be able to do that. But I get to work all weekend.
that is the worst. i am sorry to hear that.
those medical bills do add up. i wish we didnt have to pay so much to keep ourselves healthy
That is good to have new challenges.
It will be fine. Switching jobs can be scary at first sometimes
Well its not in your hands anymore so its best to stay calm and not worry about it now.
As it should_comma_ but a bad grade is not the end of the world.
Oh wow! I'm really sorry to hear that. That must have been shocking. Have you broken up now?
Oh I can understand the feeling. You should take some time for yourself before you try to do much else.
That is so nice.
Good.
Oh that's really disgusting! Did you still eat there?
Good. They don't deserve your business. You should report it to the department of health too.
sounds great
have fun!
Oh I would be mad at them too! Do you know who it was?
Oh that sucks. You might be able to get the scurity camera footage.
She shouldnt have done that without asking you. But maybe there is an opportunity here for you...
Maybe you can experiment with other women with your wife? Could be fun
Were they good memories or bad memories?
That's a very strong reaction. Still it must have been really pleasant for you.
Oh do they scare you a lot?
Oh me too actually. They are too scary for me too
Oh good luck on it! Are you studying?
Then I'm sure you'll do fine. Just try your hardest!
Did you catch them doing it?
I would be upset if that happened to me too.
oh no
hopefully it turns out well
You must have thanked him for it. He is a smart brother!
Good on you. Your brother should consider being a teacher! 
Yeah it can be tough to throw things out that remind us of special people. I still have some toys my grandma gave me when I was a baby.
Yes I do. It can be one of the few remaining physical reminders of the person.
Oh that would be really frustrating. Have you tried to do anything about it?
I'm not sure if you could train bees. You can get one of those protective suits I guess.
That is terrible. Did you tried calling him?
That is very bad person. You should forget about him.
You must be feeling so anxious_comma_ yet so excited right now!
You need to keep a cool head though_comma_ try doing some sports to relax your mind.
Wow! That's an amazing accomplishment! You must be so proud of him!
That's really great for him. Maybe he should try out for the olympics?
That is great! How did it turn out?
I'm sure it won't be long until your hard work is rewarded
Sounds amazing! Are you going any place in particular?
Beaches are fun! I don't even know the last time I've been to a beach.
that could not always be a good thing
it is nice when it happens
Yes that is incredibly annoying! I'm a quiet person by nature so that can drive me carzy quite fast!
Yes I feel like yelling at them - But that's just something that I would never actually be able to do!
You must be so surprised! Technology has really advanced in the last few years.
Yep_comma_ my son just got me an iPhone 8 and I was surprised at how alien it was to me.
Oh no_comma_ that must have been embarrassing... but it happens.
Wow you might have gotten a little bit of trauma from it. But I'm sure it will fade from memory eventually.
That is terrible. Probably_comma_ he wanted money to buy drugs.
It could be a good explanation but he shouldn't have cursed.
What!? Did they steal anything?
That's no good. Those windows are not cheep either. Hopefully it wont cost too much. 
It's exciting that you will be able to reconnect with an old friend. I understand that you're nervous_comma_ though!
I'm sure once you see each other and get to chatting it will be like no time has passed! Have fun!
That must have been very scary! Did you investigate it?
lol yeah our minds can play tricks on us when we're nervous. I'm glad it was nothing serious though.
Get yourself some good food and watch a movie! Sometimes it's good to take some time for yourself
I get you_comma_ I've been in your situation before
That sounds like so much fun! I think you should. I love roller coasters!
I've been on so many. They're definitley worthwhile! At least in my opinion!
I bet your chances are high. Party at a friends or family?
cool well i hope you get what you want 
I'm so sorry about that. That must have really been horrible for her... and you
Wow that often. That must really be stressful.
Parties are so much fun! Are you celebrating anything special_comma_ or is the party just a get together?
Sounds like a good time! Have fun at the party!
Oh good luck! I hope you're able to win.
I can imagine. Going through the process is very stressful. Do you have an attorney representing you at least?
That is a nice surprise! Did you get charged more later?
I wouldn't either. Lucky day for you!
That really sucks. You can always look into new housing options.
Well do you have enough room to bring in a roomate?
Oh no! and you can't go with her?
Oh ok well she'll be back before you know it!
Oh really? That must have been very exciting to get!
That sounds really entertaining. I've seen those fun coffee mugs with shapes at the bottom.
That sounds exciting! I hope you did well.
I'm hoping for you! I always got stressed out waiting for grades too. Despite knowing that I did well.
Oh no that's annoying indeed.
I'm sure they wanted to be there though. Hopefully they are thinking of you.
Oh no! That's a terrible way to start your day. Did you still go to work?
Well at least you managed to make it through the day. I probably would have just gone home.
that sounds like so much fun!!! staying the night over the weekend? 
Sounds even better than bc I need a bed to sleep! lol 
That is always a bit embarrassing.  Did you blush? 
That is pretty funny_comma_ to be honest.
Oh wow! That must have been a really scary experience. What happened to the spider?
It's a good thing that he was there to take care of it. I just saw a tarantula exhibits at the zoo. Even through the windows that made me nervous.
Oh no! Are you able to retake it?
I'm sorry to hear that
Oh I'm really sorry to hear that. Was it a big lie?
That's a pretty serious issue. You should punish him somehow.
Like something out of a movie! my god. Did you nail it? 
I am sure you did! 
am sorry about that_comma_ you could have reminded them perharps
yah_comma_ next time remind them earlier so you dont feel disturbed
Wow that's funny! 
That's nice. You guys can bond over it
Excellent! Convey my congrats to her. 
Motivate her to participate in more competition like this.
Im so sorry for your loss. Did you have it long?
You didnt keep it in a cage? Maybe you can get another and keep it more secure. 
oh no are you planning to get another one ?
what kind of breed was it
i agree with that.every day is a new start
yes we all do. i really fell you on that
i love listening to oldies. music now isnt as good as it used to be! memories right 
yes they are luckily we will always have them! 
LOL! Oh no_comma_ we're you able to change right away?
At least it was water and not coffee or juice
Ah that must have been nostalgic. Did you grow up with your cousin?
I see. It's really good you got to catch up though!
Oh really what was the ad about ?
That would be so fun i have always wanted to go but havent had the time !
That's good to hear. Did you sell the old one to help pay on the new one?
Well_comma_ at least you got a new car that doesn't break down.
Wow! That's a great achievement. You must really be proud.
That's great. Sounds like she has a bright future ahead of her.
That could be an unsettling situation.
I hope you had one. That is scary. Are you ok?
Did you call the police?
Do you live in a house or an apartment?
yeah that was good to helping others. it was a go9d manner i loved it.
yeah it was quite appriciated
Do you have a topic to discuss?
:( fantastic...
I can understand that. It's usually either parents are happy they are out of the house_comma_ or sad that they're gone. I'm sorry you feel lonely. 
I can understand that. Kids have a big presence and their energy creates a void. Hopefully you can find things to take your mind off of it. 
Yes it is. My youngest has been away all this week for his first summer camp. It's been both awesome and lonely. 
Oh wow! what did you do?
Thank goodness for that! 
So then what did you do?
Yeah that's pretty crappy for sure!
Oh no! Hopefully there isn't a mess to clean up when you get back.
Maybe next time you will remember! Haha.
Oh no! When I misplace things_comma_ I try to retrace my steps. Have you tried that?
Uh oh...I have a cat who likes to steal things too lol Try checking underneath the furniture.
That must be fun for them.  Our neighbor hood only has older people so my kids stay around the house.
See and i would have though the opposite_comma_ but I suppose if they are gone all the time it might get overdone.
Yeah_comma_ I can see that being an issue.  I guess your not as lucky as I was first initially thinking.  Im like you a home body.
That is crazy! He must have got a loan.
He probably won't be able to! Time will tell.
What kind of problems?
You mean tortures?
it was good habit i like it
that was really bad
Did you try to help them?
There is nothing you can do then.
Is that a prince album?
Well give it back :) Stealing is not right
What happened? Did you uncle drove over the speed limit?
That is horrible. He could have even crashed the car by being drunk. How could you let him drive
Oh that is quite strange_comma_ I hope nothing has happened to them.
Yea_comma_ I would find that rude as well_comma_ if he cares about the relationship he should apologize or make it up.
What airplane? Did you know someone on it?
That is really sad. Where was it at?
What kind of car did you buy?
Did you get an insurance check?
Oh no! That's a tough change_comma_ but I suppose you'll have to try to join clubs and make new ones!
It's harder as an adult_comma_ but you can make some by joining some adult clubs that focus on sports or recreation. Or_comma_ if you have a neighborhood club_comma_ joining that!
When will you show your boss the design?
That is a smart move by you.
That's really impressive! What do you like about it?
That does sound really exciting. 
Thats just the best_comma_ i have to plan one of these this fall with my wife
I understand _comma_ it feels good but when you are away you keep thinking about home and the kids lol
That's strange. Did you?
Did he walk away afterwards?
Why?
Yeah I understand
Oh god..well I hope she left you and you've learned that no one likes a betrayer
That/s disturbing kiddo..you lied and betrayed then you left. You have much to learn about life and how to treat others
Oh cool_comma_ what was the research about? 
That's interesting_comma_ I'm not sure I even knew there were different types of caffeine. Is one type worse than the others? 
How long have you been with your boyfriend?
That's a long time_comma_ so sorry to hear about your troubles.
Wow so close to being out on her own are you a bit nervous? 
Very sad but think of how proud she is going to make you in the good she will be just fine.
Why do you say that?
That is so true. I feel the same way. It's just nice to know that you work hard for your money.
i have been slacking but thats only because i moved_comma_ i have to start back up
they are offering a free pass at my gym might take it up
It must be nice to have a house
I am sure it does
Are you ok?
I bet. That always happens to me. At least its gone now for you
Really?
So sorry about that
Your child?
You are excited about this or??
Why do you say that?
I am sorry to hear that. I hope things get better for you
I completely understand! They scare me and I become like a little girl! The rat snakes are great though...I would never hurt them..but I don't want them near me or in eye vision! lol
LOL! omg..I use that word_comma_ I didn't think anyone else did! That is the perfect word for it. I saw a tarantula in the pet store the other day and my skin jumped off of me
wow so happy you got it all done_comma_ must feel nice right
that does sound like a lot of stuff going on at once
Oh I bet. Was it your first grandchild?
What a great day that must have been for you.
What will you do on vacation?
Will you stay in a condo on the beach?
That sounds so relaxing! You'll probably sleep great.
That is awesome what was the play about did kids perform? 
I heard of Hamlet that's the one about the prince right I would enjoy to see that being played out in the future glad you enjoyed it. 
Yes_comma_ the cable company is infuriating. Do they eventually help you though?
That's awful.  That definitely is the worst.  Maybe it's time to change companies.
I am sorry about that. What kind of keys?
Oh wow! That stinks. At least you got new keys
Nostalgic feelings can be nice! I hope you didn't feel sad
That's great! Have you moved out of state?
That would annoy me so much. Can you take it up with management?
What a tough situation. Just make sure and document everything.
What a great accomplishment! I can understand why you'd be happy about that.
You should be really proud of that.
What happen_comma_ did he make it?
Damn that sucks 😒
Oh wow_comma_ why would she think you stole the money?
Would she have any reason not to trust you?  I would assume you have not done anything like this before.
Oh god that is horrible! Look in too Bitter apricot and also Chlorella if she does radiation..both have research done on them to help a LOT with cancer.
I can imagine! I have been through it with others. It is terrifying!
Could you purchase one from a local store?
I see_comma_ online is such a convenience but if things get delayed or don't work it becomes an issue.
A race with running or with cars?
As long as you trained hard and did your best_comma_ that is what counts!
Oh no!  Have you had any luck?
That must be so scary.  I'm really glad you have some good options to try.
Well hopefully you are a guy? I know how you feel_comma_ it feels great to lose weight!
How much weight did you lose? I have lost over 100lb before. Does feel awesome
which restarant
oh i thought you were eating out
Did your boss understand at least?
That's true. I would be mad about that as well
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you had your cat a long time?
I bet it has. They become a part of the family and it can be hard to let go
Did you invite him?
Wow! I bet you had a good time though at your party
will it start you think
i pay 34 but they are pros
I feel you there! I have two broken ones in my driveway! What kind of car did you get?
A new car is a new car :) Just make sure to get it tune ups and oil changes etc on time
I am so sorry about that. How are you holding up?
I bet thats rough. I would be the same way if my dog died.
Whoops_comma_ guess you were embarassed.
Have you been back since ?
maybe she is getting older_comma_ mines a little grumpy as well but i accept it
that's not too bad_comma_ maybe she needs more attention from you 
Try your local pawn shop for a cheap one you don't want a messy looking yard.
That is crazy maybe you should check offer up and that is crazy I dislike when people steal what is yours especially something you really need. 
How did that go?
That's great to hear! I am happy for you
That was very nice of them_comma_ you must have worked hard to get that.
Well_comma_ sometimes just following orders really well is enough to impress your superiors.
So annoying. Where were their parents?
What a pain in the you know what. I wish the parents could be punished too. Haha
Keep your head up and keep applying to other companies_comma_ something will come around for you.
It is_comma_ but you have got to keep grinding.
where are you vacationing
OMG my dream vacation
What were your favorite movies he did?
That is a favorite of mine too! He was so good in it.
Oh..take it back to them..I have had so many take mine and it's not cool
Thats sickening. Don't steal stuff or you deserve anytime you get stolen from
Are you kicking them out for a valid reason?
Just make it short and sweet.
Did you get into any trouble over it?
Did they get into trouble over it?
Make her dinner one night to cheer her up
She will enjoy that you are showing that you care.
Im sorry about that. Did anyone notice?
Ok well_comma_ I would have done the same thing. I am terrified of roller coasters.
What happened? Normally people are excited about weekends
I don't get it. You are not making sense. Is it your overall stress or depression that is making you feel this way?
Oh lord_comma_ you know August is the hottest month in Florida- Make sure to be prepared for walking around in it
Lol! Ah- you must not be irish at all. Sounds good_comma_ give me your genes!
Oh boy_comma_ I used to do that and I'm sure my kids will. Im sure you were angry!
I tell my kids that_comma_ as well. It can be difficult and unexpected raising teenagers.
I know! I am excited about it. Are you?
Same. Ive worked hard this week and now I am ready to just relax
It must be nice to be close to someone like that.
Yall must have been friends for a long time then.
She may think it was funny and that is your way in!
Just laugh it off and go back with confidence.
Oh_comma_ no. What are you going to do?
I'd say you need to report him.
What is the make and model of it?
Chevrolet makes great trucks_comma_ as the one you have has lasted this long.
that was very nice of them congratulations
didn't you at least suspect ? 
Ugh_comma_ that sounds really unpleasant.  Do not want lol
Sometimes I want to be like_comma_ "you are not discreet!"
I would be the same way. Did the snake attack you?
Well_comma_ thats ok. Did you kill it?
not my favorite time of the year
when i was a kid the adults use to scare me so since then i have not been a fan but i will take my kids tricker treating
That is horrible
It was just a tire he couldve let it go.
I don't kow anything about that. what happened?
That's terrible. I had no idea
I see. I used to play this game along with Battlefield in the past when in college. Now_comma_ I only FIFA only_comma_ others do not interest me much
Good old days of playing these games all nights with my roommates. Now adult life is so different and boring
Wow_comma_ how that happened?
That is terrible. What did you do then?
Have you seen doctor
Make sure you get them done
The lovely leaves fall from the trees.
Yeah it really is
where are you heading
just keep your money close to you and your passport closer
Its getting real old to see the teams who have the most money keep winning.
Something has to change. Its very annoying.
They've just let me down one two many times.
It's really a long story_comma_ but I won't be going back.
Okay_comma_ but I'm pretty sure we aren't done yet.
Oh really? It's pretty hot where I live. 
Oh wow! That is surprising
where are you heading to
i wish i was you
Same here. Sundays are so much better with NFL.
And this heat can go away too.
Well_comma_ at least you passed. You're both on equal ground now.
That's great_comma_ it'll pay off for her over time.
It is frustrating to work with such people. They should be fired instead of keeping them there
See. They will only hinder the overall performance. You should talk to your manager
I am sorry to hear that. Their is always next time.
I know. I always get that feeling when I don't win the lottery.
Really already!? wow.. what year for you? 
Everything new is always scary. I am sure you are going to do great! Good luck! 
Oh no_comma_ did you file a police report?
That is good_comma_ glad it will get taken care of
You have an amazing friend!
Well that's awesome! I bet you will have a great time
I'm not too sure about it really_comma_ but the candy's good! What is it you like about it?
Awww_comma_ that's precious! Perhaps if I had kids it would be different. They must get so excited about dressing up and going out!
Thats excellent news how rewarding! 
Im happy for you! 
Was that an issue for some reason?
Oh_comma_ okay. Well then it was a nice surprise.
That can definitely get aggravating! It always seems to happen at the worst time.
I understand_comma_ maybe you can set up certain times or something
i bet you are excited
havent seen her for a while ?
Amazing! How old is he? 
Adorable so happy for you! 
We get really busy in the Fall with a lot of extracurricular stuff.
I see_comma_ well hang in there. In about 5 minutes_comma_ they'll be older.
I love the cool breezes of fall
We spend more time outside in fall than summer. summer is way too hot
I don't even know what that is lol
Sounds neat. Do you usually cook korean dishes?
Oh man. Are they still ok?
That sucks. Must hurt throwing all that away.
now is the time the real growing up starts
oh boy
Oh_comma_ I would have screamed and ran. I hate snakes so much!
I don't care what kind it is. I will stay far away from them.
So am I! Do you have plans?
That sounds good. I hope you get re-energized.
Maybe she will be .
Okay_comma_ then run for the hills. 
Wow! That's quite the milestone! Any plans to retire?
May as well keep going if you're healthy.
Sounds like you're burned out. Where ya going?
The beach is awesome when the weather is good. Hope you have fun!
I know how that feels. Did everything turn up ok?
Could be worse right? Glad everything ended up being ok.
what was she hiding ?
that was probably us when we were little lol _comma_ my little nieces are the same way and they are such bad actors too
will you have enough time?
i hope so. It feels good when your day goes smoothly
That's terrible can you reprint them
that sucks
Same here. I can sometimes remember where I was the first time Ive seen some to.
Some have aged really well though.
seems to be the norm these days allover the country
i get here nearly everday (orl)
I miss that too! I am always telling everyone to get off their phones and be present. 
It is and it wont change not even in my house 
it could come in useful but how often though? is it worth it ?
you never know until you try or you can also do those online courses
I hear ya. I hate it when people check their phones when I'm trying to talk to them.
I know what you mean.
I bet that was a great time.
That is so cool to have those memories.
that's exciting! I hope everything will go good. just be you and i'm sure they will love you
/i love your confidence!
Yea he did some foul things to those people.
I am glad someone stepped up and spoke out about.
why is that
is he a nice person the manager ?
Well_comma_ that's good. Did she borrow money from you?
Perhaps she's turned over a new leaf. It's very good of you to lend her money_comma_ even if she is your sister.
It's surprising how people suddenly wake up and realize that perhaps they haven't been acting as perhaps they should have.
Good! Plan and spend the money as you wish!
Nice! wish you get more bonus in upcoming months.
Well I hope she gets in soon and you guys have a good time together!
Well that sounds fun! Hope she has a good flight!
I hate other drivers.  It seems like they are getting worse every day.  Did you honk at them or anything?
I would be too.  I'm happy you didnt get into an accident or even worse_comma_ killed!
Oh man. Must be feeling pretty guilty by now.
Just try and be better prepared next time so you dont get tempted again.
That's really good. Where are you flying to?
Nice! Texas is really nice this time of year.
Thats great news.  Did you have to study or is this an area you are already familiar with?
Awesome_comma_ good luck on your test! I hope it all goes well!
I love cooking. What did you prepare?
That is trivia. When i am hyped_comma_ i cook lasagna. I know that is hard to cook_comma_ but i mastered it all on my own
that is good_comma_ did you like your watch?
Does it have some cool features?
What is the painting of? It sounds lovely!
Which city was it?
I'm sorry someone passed away.  Did you find a good photo to represent that person?
Thats very sweet of her.  I'm sure it was nice_comma_ although sad_comma_ looking back at those memories.
Congratulations! Does it come with a raise?
Woah_comma_ that's incredible! You deserved it :)
That's a long time to be away. Are you going by yourself?
The opportunity probably won't come along to many times in a lifetime. You should take advantage of it and enjoy yourself as much as you can.
you don't have friends at work?
no partner at home either? work stuff can be really dtressful
Good for you. Are you really close to this friend? I wish I had more close friends
I am also single and there is no one to take me out just to soothe my inner emotional turmoil
That sucks. did he admit to doing it?
Yeah that's true. I don't let people borrow my car anymore. Too big of an investment
Congratulations on that. Hope you have landed the job? Did you?
What company have you applied to? Is it a big player in the industry it operates?
Will there be a next time ?
I'm sorry to hear it went this way for you.
That's a good idea. There's a lot of preparation that goes into a good trip.
So true. I hate it when that happens.
No_comma_ but we are going on a cruise to Cozumel next Spring Break and I think that would be so much fun. Have you ever been?
That sounds amazing! I bet it was so much fun!
What is your budget?
You could buy a trailer?
Congrats! You must have taught her well :)
Yum_comma_ sounds amazing!
Oh boy_comma_ how did it go?
Congrats_comma_ that's a real accomplishment!
That's awesome_comma_ glad to hear_comma_ what are you most happy with?
A solid and happy family life is the key to a happy life!
Yes_comma_ I hear you on that one.
Going swimming on Sunday_comma_ Relaxing and maybe grocery shopping on Saturday.
OMG I know! It's impossible to sleep :( I'm sorry that happened to you.
Those scoundrels! How can they get away with that?
That's a nice surprise! When was the last time you saw him?
Aw_comma_ that's awesome_comma_ I hope you two have a good time together!
That's great! Keep it up. Weight loss is tough
Haha yup dieting is hard. All I want to do is eat delicious stuff all the time
Woah that's nuts! Have you called to complain?
That's ridiculous! Can you switch?
That's awesome_comma_ I'm with you_comma_ I always wished I continued to learn to play the guitar.  It's always a nice skill to have.
Hey_comma_ it's never too late to start up again.  You can always do it as a hobby!
Haha_comma_ right on. It's nice when they become a little more self-aware and develop parts of the brain that help them realize it's not all about them_comma_ and that it's good to be selfless.
That's the sign of a good parent. You're reaping what you sowed_comma_ in a good way. Hopefully it carries on when he's an adult and he becomes another good human being that we have few of
Oh no! Can you do some gig economy work online to try to make enough?
Woah that's awful_comma_ those things are such a rip off!
Did they help you?
I'm glad things worked out for you.
Oh yeah? Why is that?
That's awesome! What instruments do they play?
Oh_comma_ that sounds tasty have you eaten it yet?
I know the feeling_comma_ it's too good to stop.
That's nice. I was never too good at spelling
that's even better. He will be correcting you soon lol
I lost a cat before. Its a lot to deal with.
It get better with time. 
oh wow thats quite a while
oh dang ive never really been in that situation before
wow that is embarassing for them! maybe they had a crazy night and had no time to shower?
oh gosh that is awful! sounds like depression!
That sounds great!  You must have felt really happy!
It sounds like you were quite content and joyful with you time you had with your daughter.
you don't like this dog?
Oh yes_comma_ i completely understand that. Just get some snacks and watch a lot of movies :)
Ouch! Are you okay?
I'm so sorry!
Awww what's wrong? Maybe going to the lake will cheer you up?
That is a bummer! Well_comma_ you can go next time!
You sound like me a few weeks ago with my relatives_comma_ since they have a bunch of kids under the age of 10. Sorry to hear you're going through the same stress. 
Yeah_comma_ even if they're not being annoying or bad... just so many people at once and all that activity.. too much. Love to see them come_comma_ and love it even more to watch them go.
I had some one tip me a $25 chip at the casino after seeing a pic of my daughter in my locket. I cried lol
Serving tables is hard. some days you can work your hardest and make absolutely nothing. I had to quit after so many years
Do tell! What upgrades have you given it?
Oh that's nice.  What color did you change it to?
That's a great color
I havent done that in ages. How did you do?
Just gonna have to work harder for next time. 
That sucks_comma_ if it had been in the coffee shop maybe it could have been replaced.
They have these new portable cup holders that attach to almost anything. Maybe that can help in the future.
I can't wait til I make it that far_comma_
I am only a sophmore
Are you happy or sad about moving?
Well_comma_ I hope you have a good experience in your new city and raise an amazing family!
Oh_comma_ man!  That is horrible!  What can you do about it?
If you can't_comma_ it may throw you off by a whole semester!  I would be really mad if I were you!
Nice!  Always good to be prepared_comma_ makes things a lot less stressful if there is one.
Florida gets hit a lot! Smart move being ready_comma_ but I hope you stay safe regardless!
What are you doing to improve your self?
So you're improving your self by getting married?
oh my god_comma_ so sad. how did that happen. Feel so sorry for you
sorry for your loss
Good job_comma_ it's always good to hit the gym and to stay in shape.  I just started again as well.
Just keep at it and I'll do the same! We will be shredded in no time!
That's a good effective walk!
Yeah i get that. I don't go outside for long periods of time.
That's too bad. don't give up though
There will be something you like
You must be so proud of her.
That is great to hear. Sounds like she has good head on her shoulder.
Congrats! What will your new position be?
That's amazing! :)
I'm jealous of you. I've had a roommate the past few years since I'm in college. First one I had battle depression and mental illness_comma_ and even checked himself into a behavioral center because he was feeling suicidal. This recent roommate seems normal enough though.
I'm glad to hear it. At least you know you're good at being social in some ways. Maybe you can make friends outside of roommates_comma_ and then be able to be social outside of your apartment and be able to come home and have the peace and quiet.
Hopefully it is just a sprain. Might not need to receive medical attention.
Ouch man. Just keep it on ice for the evening and reassess in the morning.
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you called IT?
Maybe its time for a new printer?
That sounds fun. What are you most excited about?
I've never been dove hunting. It sounds interesting.
Uh oh_comma_ whose vase did you break?
Ah man_comma_ that's a bummer_comma_ hopefully she isn't too mad and will forgive you!
What job did he get?
That's amazing_comma_ did he get a job at google?
Fun friends and good food. Who is your team?
Boomer Sooner!
Ah_comma_ that's awesome_comma_ it's always a joy to see a new born baby experiencing it's first view of the world!
How old are your kiddos now?
That must be nice. You can focus more on enjoying yourself while away.
That is awesome. They must really like you.
Congratulations! That is great_comma_ definitely will help your gpa.  Plan on doing the same this semester?
That's the way to do it_comma_ you will be thankful you did in the long run!
Aw_comma_ are they not anymore?
LOL! I hear that :)
That's incredibly sweet. That's like the best birthday gift too_comma_ since it probably tasted really good_comma_ but then showed your time and effort all in one. I heard once to make them taste like a professional made it_comma_ you just add like extra eggs and sugar and butter or something
Damn.. hope when I have kids that they're like you. That all sounds great. You'll probably make all of his friends jealous
Oh my gosh that's disgusting!!! I hate when there are flying things buzzing around Soo annoying
Seriously. I wonder where those babies would have been laid? You probably saved someone's lunch from being a birthing suite.
Did you get a nice prize for it?
That's amazing_comma_ how many people entered?
Huge win_comma_ do you plan on entering again next year?
Maybe if there's a hot dog one I can enter it too.
Congradulations you must be very proud of her! What is her degree in?
I think that's great to hear. Does she already have an art gallery started?
I would love to but we can't share images on here :(
I enjoy watching art. Maybe I'll hapen across some of it!
What kind of lunches do you like to pack for them?
Fingerfoods are always good kid lunches. And I hate having to go to the dang grocery store!
Lol! That is hilarious. I hope you got it on video
omg. I love your mom lol
That's never a fun thing to do
Do you know what kind it was?
What job did you interview for?
That's amazing_comma_ you must be so excited right now
Whoa. What happened?
Oh that is devastating. I hope insurance covers.
I believe there are things in life that are irreplaceable and priceless! There is no amount of money that can give you the true value of your grandfather's watch. I think you should pass it down to your grandchildren.
I consider this a family heirloom and your children would be happy to share this story for years to come.
Wow!  That is amazing!  I guess a little tough instruction and training has paid off!  No need to worry then.
That's fantastic.  It sounds like she has tapped into her inner musical talent!
What is going to happen?
Oh boy_comma_ have a great time!
Ew_comma_ what did you do?
Aw_comma_ that's disappointing!
Wow_comma_ That's unfortunate. Sorry to hear. were you close?
I hope you are finding ways to cope with your loss. That can't be easy to deal with. 
I hope that helps you and that you find peace. 
I'm guessing she didnt ask to use them?  Has she taken them in the past?
That would be very frustrating. Hopefully she will learn to replace things as she gets older!
You worked hard_comma_ what are you studying in school?
I believe you can do it_comma_ what do you hope to get a job doing after?
Amazing. I bet that was awesome. Do you play yourself?
I bet you were having a great time.
Yea that is really far. Give it some time and I am sure you will meet some new people.
It takes time to adapt to a new city. Get involved in some groups to meet like minded people.
Oh_comma_ good luck on it! What are you applying for?
That's a great attitude to have going in. They really pick up on confidence at interviews.
Aw_comma_ that is really cute of your cat to do.
It's good to have a pet in your life_comma_ makes you happy.
Why not? I LOVE chicken!
Oh no! Maybe the restaurant you ate from wasn't clean?
Its sad. How many rescues do you have?
Well I appreciate you. 
i want to rescue but I have to wait until I move. No pets allowed here
Oh no!  How old was he?
What type of dog was he?
That's gross. Did you make the sandwich yourself or buy it from a restaurant?
Nasty. That makes me want to not eat there anymore_comma_ but I guess it happens sometimes.
I hope you got a refund.
That is just the worst_comma_ who made fun of you?
That's so disappointing. People should really not be judging others when they don't know how much effort was put in to the outfit.
Hi are you still here?
It did_comma_ what were we talking about again?
I can understand that. I lost my dog a few years ago. What's worse is I wasn't around when it happened--I was out of the state. I hope you at least got to say goodbye.
Man.. I'm so sorry. I remember when I was really young_comma_ I was in the car with my mom and she hit our neighbor's cat driving home. They just ran right out into the street. She drove home and cried for a while.
Who knows. They could have been like my mom_comma_ and maybe they were different and were too ashamed to say anything. Might not have noticed_comma_ either. Or they were just bad people. Hopefully you can focus on your pet and how much you loved them instead of those things you can't get answers to.
... then what?
Aw_comma_ wonderful!
Well that's good!  What did you all do?
We do something similar at our Thanksgivings.  Did you make a home-cooked meal?
What sorts of pie did yo umake?
We haven't really done pies in a while_comma_ but my grandma makes a chocolate roll and my mom makes some awesome pumpkin bars.  Do you roast your turkey?  We use a turkey fryer for ours.
That sounds pretty awesome.  What did you guys grill?  Was she over for a special occasion at all?
I agree.  I had a cousin living with me for a while until he got on his feet.  I really preferred that over a stranger.  It sounds like you both had an awesome night!
cool
i bet. I miss my friends
That's good to hear. How old is she?
Hey_comma_ you can go out and not pay a babysitter. 
That's good. Were you nervous at first?
Well that's nice that you all get along. you ar actually pretty lucky
Hmm.. what's that mean? Do you feel like you did something wrong?
Ah_comma_ I see. Yeah_comma_ that's an easy habit to have. I would be that way too if I wasn't too cheap to spend money. I just try to do a lot of croc-pot stuff since I stink at cooking and am poor
OH no! Did you study?
LOL! English is a tough subject.
That is a very big problem to me! However_comma_ if you signed a new lease with him it seems as if you can deal with it right?
Well it seems that you have to deal with him for at least another year. With that in mind I hope you have more than one bathroom. I suggest you let him keep his poop in one without cleaning it up until it starts to bother him!
Dang_comma_ that sounds too good to be true. If you're 100% sure that it's not a scam_comma_ and then 100% sure again that it's definitely not a scam (please really really check in every way possible)_comma_ then I'm happy for you!
Whaaat! That was cool of them. If it were me_comma_ it'd be torture trying to figure out what to do. Put it into stocks? Savings? Pay off debt? Go on a vacation? I hate making decisions cause I feel like I messed up no matter what I choose. But maybe you deserve a vacation_comma_ eh
Congrats. you are lucky
really? wow
That's fun_comma_ do you think you will enjoy it?
Uh oh_comma_ well at least you won't be a lone when you watch a scary movie.
What was she doing?
Ohhh wow.  I hope you were successful!
What did you get in the mail?
That is awful_comma_ did you miss some payments?
Whats the reason?
I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ how is he feeling now?
Nice!!! When are you planning on going?
That's so close. Have you gone jet skiing on that lake before?
I know that feeling! I have 2 dogs and 1 cat. Love them to death.
Yeah! and they are so excited to see you and welcome you home!
Why has it taken so long?
Sorry.. when I first read what you said I read it as Grandparents.. I don't know why.  My brain is tired from work.
Oh no_comma_ how did you end up in that situation.
Haha_comma_ that's awesome_comma_ at least you two made it out of it safely.
I would have been so excited lol.  What did it look like?!
Was anyone with you?  Did anyone believe you?
Thats awesome though.  I didn't graduate until I was 40 something
That really is quite an accomplishment.. the type that makes you cry at graduation ceremonies!
That's very sweet. I was just dog-sitting my neighbor's dogs last week. They were a little annoying at first_comma_ but I had to watch and stay with them the whole week_comma_ and I really grew to like them. They felt like my little sisters I had to take care of and play with
Right_comma_ yeah_comma_ you just get used to their presence. I hated that they'd bark so much at thunderstorms_comma_ but other than that_comma_ their little quirks were growing on me. In fact_comma_ I miss them right now
Have you been drinking more water lately? or it's just happening for no reason?
That would be a good idea_comma_ it's better to get tested and treated early if it is anything serious!
Oh my!  You must have been pretty embarrassed.  Did someone bring you gas?
I'm sure its happened to him before and understands.
Awesome! How was that? do you think she will enjoy high school?
I know that feeling_comma_ I'm waiting for the college to start myself!
Aww_comma_ that's so sad. I'm sure she would have wanted ya'll to keep having fun times together.
Yes_comma_ it's good to keep bonding. I understand not being able to do it at first_comma_ though
Oh_comma_ man_comma_ mine too! It's so annoying.
Sure does. I think they get a little jealous and just want our attention. They're also very curious about the world_comma_ which is a good thing!
Is there not an upgraded version?
Oh. I know what you mean. I am like that with shoes. I always change my phone
I would have though that your crystal ball would have forewarned you? ;)
Did you keep your receipt?  Maybe you can exchange it or get your money back?  ;)  lol
I feel your pain totally.  I take an online class and I am a teacher at a new school this year
Fun times!  Makes you think back to being in HS.  I am working in a HS this time.
Nice! I hate looking for apartments. I'm in college and have looked for apartments for the past three years. It gets really old after a while_comma_ since I'm on a budget and it's hard to find something cheap but not a rat's nest. Glad you found what you wanted.
I live right next to my campus too! The downside is it's a building made in the '50s and looks terrible on the inside. But I can bear it since I'm saving money. Most college kids have their parents money and just choose a fancier place because they don't care about money. 
I hate that!  Knowing a spider or any sort of bug is in your room and then knowing you have to go to sleep.  I would have done the same thing.
Haha_comma_ while he builds back up his spider web.
LMAO.  LOLOL.  I pay 600 a month.  You?
see it can get worse!  lol... I am paying cash for my classes now but I only take 1 at a time.
That's sad_comma_ well_comma_ HAPPY BIRTHDAY! 
I sort of feel the same way_comma_ the older I get_comma_ the less I care about my birthday.
Ah_comma_ so are you feeling pretty lonely? That's interesting that he took the dog with him on a business trip_comma_ but who am I to judge! Could be viewed as kind of cool that he's that close with the dog.
Yeah_comma_ he should have left the dog with you so not only would you have some company_comma_ but some protection_comma_ too. But I don't know all of the situation so I guess I shouldn't say for sure! Hopefully it's not for too long so you guys can get back to being a trio
Aw_comma_ you shouldn't feel bad!  At some point you'll have more cash and do the treating.  There's a lot of give and take in relationships.
I totally get it.  I bet you think about it way more than she does_comma_ though I don't know if that makes you feel any better lol
What restaurant is it?
What kind of food do they make? Sorry to hear that! That's awful.
Maybe they could get funding from the municipality.
Marked what wrong?
Did you speak with him?
Oh. Well he will probably fix it when he gets better
I can imagine
Wow_comma_ congratulations! That is a really cool endeavor!
Sometimes it is worth taking a risk like that to have a high reward.
I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully after this project you can get some time off to spend with your family.
I'm sure your family will understand. And look at the bright side_comma_ you'll cherish your next visit even more.
That is always a good thing.  Is it free or a toll road?  Where I live most of em cost money.
Thats awesome.  Saves time and money.
Nice! School is starting next week for me also_comma_ hopefully we both have a good school year!
Is this your first year working this job? If so_comma_ hope it goes well!
She is most certainly going to enjoy that!
No special occasion then?
Yay! is it her first year or just excited to get some free time?
Oh wow_comma_ she's must be smart! But yeah_comma_ that must be stressful.
Interesting. What is your presentation about?
That's so cool! Is it like a best friend for someone who may be lonely?
Oh that sucks_comma_ I would honk harder at him
Yeah_comma_ some cities have a lot of people and some really bad drivers. They're rude and disrepectful to all other people even pedestrians.
I hope you goodluck in the future
One day when you are successful_comma_ I hope you pass your good luck forward!
Oh that's terrible! If you don't mind me asking; Who and why?
Maybe he is trying to do what he thinks is best. I'm sure it's out of love not just being mean.
Why did you do that?
So he was ok with it? or?
OMG I am so jealous I love fishing.  Where are you going?
Fun times!  I did a little beach fishing not long ago at New Smyrna.  I hope you catch some cool fish!
Have fun for me!
Oh_comma_ bless her heart. I hope you are nice to her.
That's really nice of you for being nice to her. I bet she is happy that you are her co-worker.
Oh_comma_ well that's terrible! Hopefully_comma_ your husband was okay and nobody else was hurt. But_comma_ it's awful that anyone was.
Yes_comma_ there are many times the emotional pain from tragic events are worse than physical. It doesn't make it easier that it was a person you knew_comma_ I'm sure. 
Congrats!  What class?
You deserve to be happy about that_comma_ that is not an easy class!
That's going to be a pain to fix yourself!
That was really shady of them to do that_comma_ wonder why they did?
thats awesome _comma_ i have not purchased cds in ages lol
i bet that brought back a lot of wonderful memories _comma_ from the good old days
When doe sit come out in theatres?
Oh I got you_comma_ what system is it going out on?
Oh no_comma_ I hope you was paying attention to what was around you.
That is really scary when you are alone.
Oh my gosh_comma_ what a place to break down!  I was born in ND and I know the dark you are talking about.  Were you stuck for long?
Oh yeah_comma_ of course.  I heard they are rampant up in those parts.  Did they keep you long?
I hope they returned you with all your bits and parts.  It would be alarming to find they borrowers from you later!
Oh man truer words were never spoken! How are you gonna spend your free time this weekend?
That's my thought process like every week. I think I might be getting old because sometimes I like sleeping more than being awake.
Oh no! All that work for nothing
Did it at least taste good? lol
That is good that he had an air compressor. Low tires seem to be the story of my life. I seem to always have to be airing up a tire.
They are very handy to have. We got a box that airs up tires and has jumper cables also.
They work really great. Well worth the extra dollars.
Awesome.  Is she going to university after?
That's great to hear.  She'll be flying out of the nest before you know it.
That's awesome! Not too many are able to do that!
Awesome. I'm glad that she has things going for her_comma_ and congratulations to you!
What type of food do you miss most?
It sounds like you might be from down south. I would miss it there_comma_ too.
What?! Are you sick or your family member?
Oh no_comma_ I'm so sorry to hear that_comma_ it must have been hard on you
How exciting!  Who did you order from that gave you such good service?
I would order again also_comma_ that's a good company.
That's great! I went a few months ago and really enjoyed it
I hope you have lots of fun!
wow that's great your are so lucky to see it
How exciting!  Is that your going to be your first time visiting?
I hope you have a good time there.  Be careful in the interior_comma_ it's hot as heck there.
Aw_comma_ was she stressed out?
Aw_comma_ that's no fun. I bet the constant construction didn't help at all
Oh wow!  My dog passed away recently too so I can relate to your pain.  I am so sorry for your loss
Most definetly she was my constant companion.  It will hopefully get easier for us each day
Why do you feel that way?  Has he enacted any policies that directly affect you or anyone you know?  For the record - I'm not too fond of him either_comma_ just curious more than anything.
I agree that he has said some things to suggest that.  However_comma_ I do think he has done some good and wouldnt necessarily be the worst president we have ever had.
That is very thoughtful.  Happy Birthday! What did you get from your partner?
Wow!  Now that's one cool gift if I may say so myself.
What did it say?
Wow_comma_ was it?
That's awesome. Have you been going to school for a while or is this for first semester.
Awesome. Its great. Helps keep down the student loans.
Yes_comma_ Mechanical engineering.
Math and science is my strong suite.
What did you have in there?
I love veggies_comma_ do you know who did it?
That's mean of them_comma_ they better give it back to you.
I'd still scorn them for their actions.
What's your favorite holiday?
I love that pie!!! It's delicious! My favorite holiday is Christmas. 
That's good! I think a lot of older people are pessimistic about the future_comma_ but I grew up on technology and am excited to see what new stuff comes out.
I think we need more people like you in society.
That's smart. You don't want to forget anything. Are you planning a trip soon?
What a relief_comma_ right? Where are you going?
I did too. Graduated High School in 85
Well_comma_ that's different then.
Pit stops can be fun.  How did you do on the scratch off?
No way! Congrats!!! I've never come close to that much on a scratch off.  I bet your heart was racing.
Hahaha_comma_ that sounds like fun
That's great! I like to go dancing too
What type of work do you do?
You must be getting a big pay raise you ole banker.
I hate when that happens.  Did they end up apologizing at all or did they play it off like nothing happened?
I would be too.  Its not fun when a couple people ruin a night that should be a great time!
That's no good_comma_ how did you break it?
no good_comma_ are you going to get another one?
I'd buy it off you after it's fixed_comma_ I love tag heuer.
I wouldn't maybe I could get some recommendations for a nice one?
Which chemistry class are you taking?
Yikes. organic chemistry was the last chemistry class I took.     Yuck reaction mechanisms... sn1 sn2 etc.
yeah I wasn't a huge fan of the class.
Depends on what way you're talking about Maybe physics 1 or maybe calc II.  Thats where things really started to come together for how things work +  the math to understand how things work.
What are your favorite parts about your childhood?
That sounds like a lot of fun.  Did you do this with friends and family or alone?
I hope it goes well!  Are you worried?
Then everything should go fine!  Good luck_comma_ I hope you get a raise!
Do you have a lot of experience baking cakes?
Sounds like fun. Are you excited?
Oh wow I have never been either.  Try not to be nervous!  Who are you going with?
Well I am sure you will have fun.  Just follow the instructors lead!
That's too bad_comma_ did they fit your style?
Well you saved some money at least?
How come you had to cheat on the quiz?
What did you end up making on the t est?
Where are you guys going?
That's awesome what a sweet boyfriend_comma_ how old are you turning?
Happy birthday! You must be excited
My favorite team used to the Bruins_comma_ but then I moved
Did you sit close to the ice?
Amazing_comma_ I love Chara
Well_comma_ that was absolutely terrible! He certainly picked the worse time to do it. You're right_comma_ he was a jerk!
Oh_comma_ well I'm sorry_comma_ that is definitely an unpleasant Valentine's day. But_comma_ on the positive side_comma_ at least you found out what a jerk he was before you became more committed. 
Thats awesome!  I bet you were really excited!  
You should go out and celebrate
Maybe its time to instill a little discipline.
How old are your  children?
Do you think you'll be next ?
They'd shut down then.
Have you been through many hurricanes?  We stock up in case a tornado takes out the power.
I've been through quite a few tornadoes.  I live in Missouri_comma_ but before that I lived in Kansas.  Have you ever had to use your supplies?
Yikes!  So far we haven't had to dig into the water or food.  I do debate on getting a generator though.
Aw that's so sweet. Did you find one to make?
Sound interesting! It's a cookie or is it cake-like?
Oh that must be hard.  Are you guys really close
Man I know how that feels.  When I go to visit my sister and nieces_comma_ I have such a hard time when its time to fly home
You have done such a great job! You should be proud of yourself and not be afraid to do so. 
Don't be ashamed or set yourself short espcially since you worked so hard. If you feel scared or hesitant to do so than I would talk to her boss to possibly set up a meeting.
What sport are you talking about?
I really do not like hockey_comma_ it is boring as hell
How come you're so angry?
That is no good at all_comma_ how come you did that?
Well_comma_ I'm sure you are super nervous! Of course_comma_ I have no doubt all will be well and a new experience for you!
Yes_comma_ and worse case_comma_ perhaps you can carry something on board to help relax your nerves_comma_ just in case. There's always alcohol too!
Are you excited?
Do you know if you're having a boy or girl yet?
I hope it's a boy I love kids.
Got to get him playing some sports for sure.
That sucks. Did she say why?
Wow that's harsh.
Find a new girlfriend.  That ship has sailed.   If you're really still want her consider trying to play the jealousy card.  (ie; make her jealous)
You don't even have to do that. Keep it classy. Just show up with a pretty girl and have a good time and be a perfect gentleman.  Dont even bat an eye at her.
That's great! How old are your kids?
That's really when they start to come into their own. Must be really neat!
Can you send it back for an exchange ?
We all make mistakes_comma_ just send it back and have it the way you want it.
That's good you have someone that you can talk to about your problems and feelings. I'm sure it helps!
It can be hard to find the right therapist_comma_ so it's great you have found one that really is there for you and helps.
I am sorry you have had a difficult time.  What is EP?
I am so happy you have someone so special in your life!
That's great! Is your position changing?
Oh more money is always good
I'm sure they'll be delicious.
I'm glad they came in for you.
Well_comma_ work can be stressful for many and do that. Often_comma_ we can bring it home with us.
That would be very disappointing and frustrating I'm sure. No doubt you wonder why they would do such a thing!
Im sorry to hear that.  How are you going?
Thats true.  Just remember that as much as it might sting now there are plenty of people out there and you want to find one that makes you happy all of the time_comma_ not just some of the time.
Man that is really hard.  I can relate however b/c my sweet Riley(dog) just had to be put to sleep due to congestive heart failure
It doesn't.  Try hard to stay positive and remember he isn't suffering anymore
Yummy! That's great. It's always nice when you bake something and it turns out just right.
Well_comma_ that's okay. I'm sure it tasted fantastic.
You could always watch it online!
Don't worry_comma_ I will tell Hollywood to make new episodes for you!
A little jealous much?  Maybe you should pick up a side job?
Maybe you can borrow them?
Good for you. You deserve to take some time for yourself. Anything special on that you want to watch?
Sounds like it's going to be a good night. Enjoy.
Oh wow_comma_ You think you baby might be a little sick?
I'm glad to hear it. It's always nice to get a little "me" time to get things done.
They are very busy but if she made an appointment with you then she should be there on Monday.
Oh no_comma_ you are leaving the neighbors to terrorize some unsuspecting people. That is funny.
Omg..You should get out fast as you can then. Everyone can't be trusted.
Oh no_comma_ I hate situations like that_comma_ when you still have to see people like every day_comma_ ugh.
Don't show your anger at all  or let her know it got to you.
That will bother her more I believe_comma_ lol.
How old is he? Is he mature?
I am happy for you! I hope you keep being friends forever!
I bet she was really happy about that. 
Yikes_comma_ that would drive me crazy.
It would drive me crazy also_comma_ she should be more considerate. 
Maybe she will start paying on time.
That's awesome! Did it cost you alot?
Well I'm glad that it worked out for you!
I would feel the same! heights are scary
lol! Well it's ok_comma_ it's not like you need to do anything with heights- unless you have to fly a lot. I do..but I don't like it
I feel you on that. That is awful. Is there anyone above him?
You want to make trouble?
Oh ok! I see. Well you're not making trouble anyhow_comma_ he is
Why this happened? Is he bad at what he is doing?
That is terrible if he blamed you.
It will feel good when it done though!
And your hard work will pay off!
Sorry to hear that
What happened?
Cool. What did it look like?
Are you going to display it?
Well that's nice. Maybe you can pass it don to your kids too
That sounds really nice.  Did you have fun?
Ugh_comma_ that's terrible.  I hope you found the money!
Sounds like you will! You sound confident in yourself_comma_ and I'm sure your manager is_comma_ or he wouldn't have trusted you to do it.
Definitely. Hopefully lead to a promotion for you soon!
Why do you think you will fail?
When is the test? Practice makes perfect! Fit it in!
How much did you pay for the new one?
That is a great bargain_comma_ Will you use it tonight?
What things are you looking forward to?
It sounds like your positivity will bring about something good
How does she help you out?
She sounds like a great girlfriend
i haven't played video games in so long.
i agee. i used to loooove playing mortal kombat.
Why is that?
I get that_comma_ I guess you can just bring cleaning supplies!
Why didn't you finish?
Oh. It's not too late is it?
What has she been lying about?
Are you going to punish her?
What does he ask about?
Wow. That has got to be annoying. I can never finf my landlord
Why didn't you wore them?
That is sad. I hope you find them.
How'd they ruin it?
Sounds like a mess_comma_ were they punished in some way? 
What are you going to do?
Oh_comma_ I hope you seek help for that
I am not a football fan. What did they do last season?
That is super cool. I hope they win this one too.
How'd she pass away?
Sorry to hear that
I used to play that game with my little cousins
Cool. I never have time for video games any more
Wow that is impressive_comma_ how old is she?
That is impressive_comma_ congrats on raising a smart kid!
That is impressive_comma_ congrats on raising a smart kid!
Call of duty?
I used to play
I might check it out. Get back in the game.
How old is she?
you didn't make them clean it up?
Very cool! Have you ever done yoga before or would this be a first time?
Cool!  I've heard it can be tough but I think it would be fun to try out!
OMG! I don't blame you. I would be extremely upset also.
Mine does also! It seems like it just keeps getting worse and worse. 
YES! I hate it. I can't wait till this dark time in our history is over. Hopefully a few people end up in jail! 
I don't take death well either!
Some act like it never happened. A lot of apathy going around. You'll see her again someday!
That is certainly a blessing_comma_ good for you!
I get that_comma_ but I hope that continues for you!
Are you happy now?
Well that's good. IT will come it you work for it.
How many do you have now?
Oh_comma_ well there you go_comma_ good choice!
What happened?
I probably would have tried to shoot him thinking he was an intruder
I understand. I had that problem when I was kid. Now it is ok.
Anyway_comma_ you can watch other movies.
Why?
You feel liked now?
Why did you not get driven there?
Wow_comma_ that is not safe at all for a kid though
That is great! I bet you are feeling very good.
It takes a while to feel that great. I am almost there.
sorry to hear that
yea i can understand that
Gotta play to win_comma_ that is what my grandma always said
Best of luck with it_comma_ if you hit it big slide a few million my way haha
That's nice. You guys hang out a lot?
Keep it up. You guys can be in each others' weddings lol
What movie was it?
Oh_comma_ that looked decent_comma_ hope you like it!
What did you do to him after?
What'd he say to that?
Same here. I can't do it
I don;t even try_comma_ I can barely watch suspense movies
Why is that?
Their toddlers were in the street? I feel like that is almost CPS level issues
Did you enjoy it?
What did you do? Sometimes I just sleep and that is enough for me
how did it work out for you?
good luck i hope all goes well
I am sorry. Maybe not focus as friday-sunday as the weekend_comma_ but as any other day. And do things you would normally do on other days.
That is a tough one. What do you normally do other then work on those days?
Is there anything else you do besides work? A hobby you enjoy_comma_ video games_comma_ music_comma_ working out?
Healing is never easy. It always has the negatives. Any sort of healing always starts with pain_comma_ a open wound_comma_ and itchy scabs_comma_ and the left over scar. I wish I could talk to you daily and help you get through it. I know its hard to go and do things alone. I recently discovered a text number that allows you to talk to someone when you are feeling down. it is 741741. I have used it just recently myself. It does work and is better then nothing. 
(Thank you for your words! I have a mom to talk too_comma_ so it helps but loads of trauma_comma_ abuse and death are hard to even talk about. Thank you! I hope you feel better too!) I have had to talk to customers who were nasty to clerks before! It's shocking.
I know right? Oh lord- the food industry is the worst_comma_ especially for waitresses.
Ohhhh yum!  What are your favorite toppings?
That's what I get too!  I also get vegan cheese...its delish!  Hope you have a great time chowing down tonight!
Oh no_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that. Did you reschedule?
I hope you guys will still get to spend quality time together and of course_comma_ get some rest in.
how did you manage
yea
Why is that?
Oh_comma_ why did you go that way?
Wow that sounds scary and horrible. What was it?
Oh I see. I'm glad the police came and took care of it. Sounds like a scary experience.
If you go into it with a good attitude_comma_ I'm sure at the very least it won't be bad. What kind of classes will you be taking?
Ooof! Best of luck to you_comma_ I'm sure you'll be fine. Math was never my strong suit.
Why do you like the eagles?
I understand. I hope that they will win again_comma_
What did you argue about?
That is smart_comma_ sorry that is happening to you!
What movies do you like to watch instead? 
Any favorite actors? 
Hahahaha_comma_ that is the way sumer is supposed to be for kids.  Did they at least do the things you asked them to do?
Ohh no_comma_ its worse than I thought.  It's one thing to relax_comma_ but that's different.  What are you doing to whip them back into shape?
That's terrible. Where?
Oh no! that's really terrible.
They arent that bad
Watch in the day time with the lights on and the tv volume low. That's how I got into them
Are you happy or sad about that?
Oh_comma_ well congrats then haha
what part
thats cool
I love seafood buffets
lol. thats an oldie but goodie
Nice! 
That is so cool and thoughtful!
yuk.. did you pull it out and continue to eat?
smart move
Why? What happened>
Aww that sucks. Did you find him?
How big was it?
Well great job_comma_ get something nice with it_comma_ you deserve it!
Oh yeah_comma_ I can't take scary movies of any kind.  I used to watch some of them when I was in my 20's.  What kind of movies do you like?
Yeah_comma_ they are way better than scary ones. Seems like there are horror movies coming out every other day now a days.
Not at all. It is kind of boring being left to clean everything alone.
And you might get called a weirdo. Haha
Oh man_comma_ that's awesome! What concert were the tickets for?
Well_comma_ I hope you have fun! I'm almost completely deaf_comma_ so I don't know that much about music.
what do you think is wrong?
ah i am sorry for that! hoping for the best!
I hate that
What is the purpose of that!
That is nice. Did you know the restaurant before going there?
That is super cool.
That is great_comma_ congratulations on the new place.  Is it somewhere you have wanted to move for a while now? 
That is so nice.  When do you move?
I'm sorry to hear that. Why was that?
Well that really stinks.
thats awesome that it works for you
yea i can see that
That's really good! Did you lose weight_comma_ or have you just not felt comfortable with yourself before?
That's awesome! The best part of that is looking good is only just a side affect of being healthier in general_comma_ which is great to be.
Oh that stinks. Does she live far away?
I completely understand that. I'm so busy I hardly socialize at all.
That is sad. Do you have other children?
I understand. Anyway_comma_ he will keep visiting.
Oh wow! Did you get your money back?
Oh good luck with that! Next time use airbnb or vrbo
Wow_comma_ that is impressive_comma_ I could not do that at that age
Wow_comma_ she has a bright future ahead of her if that is the case
Why its okay to be differnt
If he is rich then I am jealous of him too
That sounds upseting. Why were you scared?
Oh man well wear silver. That can supposedly burn them and scare them away. 
thats awesome!
yea that sounds like a plan
I feel you!  My two kids know all the rules and yet_comma_ they just go out the window when they want to take something or use something that isn't theirs.  I always joke that you can't have nice things with kids.
Seriously!
Congratulations! Are you having a party?
That's sounds nice and romantic
That game was fun to watch last year. Do you live in Philadelphia?
I love it there. I don't normally like football_comma_ but it's always good when the Patriots lose.
No one has ever given me a car. That must be nice
That very nice of them
What did they do to it?
Kids are like that sometimes_comma_ sorry about that
Oh no_comma_ this is a classic office disaster story. How bad was it?
Ah heck_comma_ I hate that for you. Hopefully it isn't as bad for you as it seems_comma_ but just know that that mistake has happened to several people that I know of_comma_ so you're not alone.
That sounds awesome.  I barely remember 3rd grade.  I think we just played games and had fun.
Wow thats so deep.  I cant imagine having to deal with that at that age.  They mustve been what like 8?  thats a lot to put on a kid
What did he say?
Why would he even do that?
That's great! I hope their marriage goes well.
Well that may be difficult if you aren't married first.
Cool! What kind of business?
Wow that's pretty ballsy nice job!
That is awesome.  Is she a doctor?
How much longer does she have in school?
Really? What you got going on?
That will be so much mush. He is going to have a great time.
Aww that was nice of them!!
lol.  Maybe they all came into work early just to surprise you!
That is great_comma_ do you get to see them much?
That is really good that you get to see them all the time.  Do you have kids_comma_ too?
That doesnt sounds like a surprise
Oh you just know that there's something going on. That's pretty cool
Yeah that is pretty upsetting. I don't get what is so hard about throwing away your trash. 
Maybe the kids will see all of the trash and see that it is bad and grow up to not  litter?
Oh yeah those shows can fascinating!
It's true_comma_ but I also can't help but watch. It's exciting to learn in any case.
Who's car was it?
What kind of car did she get you?
That is amazing that you got tickets.  What was your favorite part?
That is awesome.  How far in advance did you have to buy the tickets?
That's exciting!  I hope he's doing well in school!
Nice i love football.
Oh cool!  Is he going to let you drive it?  lol
Maybe you can swap Toyotas for a day :D
Yeah me too. Some people have some amazing talents. 
Yeah magic is pretty great!
Those movies are amazing.  I loved the last one with Thanos.  He was a cool character.
I actually started to understand where he was coming from...in a sick kind of way.
That's sad. What country is that?
Wow that is far. When did you come here?
What is it like over there?
Yeah I can imagine it would be simpler there.
Awww I completely understand. I remember that feeling. And mine is now a senior. Time flies! Cherish every moment with him!
I only have one. And next year he'll be going off to college. I wish I didn't have to work so much so I could have spent more time with him when he wanted to
Yea that would have been great if I could have done it. I'm happy that you do!
It's still better that an empty house!
That sounds so sad.  I hope he was ok
You have to be careful though.  Sometimes people can be really dangerous when they have nothing to lose
Why did you want to do that?
That makes a lot of sense. Sometime that's just how it goes though. 
Oh wow_comma_ are you okay?!
I hope so_comma_ and I hope you do good in the tournament :) Just rest that finger and let it heal.
Oh no :(  I hope there's someone you can stay with
From me?  But why lol?
Oh.  That sucks I'm sorry :(
Whar happened?
That is very nice. What are going to do with money?
He must be a super hero_comma_ I would have offered to help him haha. 
I wish I could have seen that sight_comma_ ask him for his workout schedule.
Im so sorry. Thats horrible. I cant imagine how you must feel
I know you cant ever replace him_comma_ but Would you consider getting a new dog?
Yeah I stole money of my mom's dresser once. 
Wow that's really rough. It was only $5 but she was still really upset about it. 
That is weird. Did you say anything?
Well that is pretty gross.
What movie? I can't watch scary movies anymore since having kids_comma_ they are too realistic now haha
Thank you for the heads up! Maybe sleep with a night light on tonight :) Sweet dreams!
Oh no!  Extra workload is terrible!  Did you make it through?
I bet.  Did you relax when you got home?
That's a killer end to a stressful day!  
Why? What happened?
Oh! I thought it was something bad_comma_ I hate roller coasters too!
Good luck!
That's kind of sad.  What makes you reluctant?
Well I'm sure the odds are against him_comma_ but I hope he succeeds this time.
Man_comma_ I wish I had the money to afford a boat_comma_ I don't know about you.
Imagine days spent cruising around on the water!
You got this girl! I was induced when I had my daughter a year ago! I was scared too but honestly don't remember much.
Just enjoy and rest on your last weekend before baby_comma_ It'll all be worth in when you are holding your little girl :) Don't listen to those scary stories_comma_ those are the 1 in a million chances it goes wrong!
That's awesome! What kind of restaurant is it?
Oh those are great and a lot of times they make everything fresh! What is your favorite meal there?
Did you find any?
Wow
That's super frustrating! Did you walk out?
That's the bit I kind of don't like about restaurants. I get why they don't let you get your own beverages but at the same time it seems unnecessary to have to wait for someone to refill your glass.
Wow_comma_ are you ok?
Hahaha_comma_ that must've been pretty funny though. Im assuming he/she helped you up?
That's good_comma_ where was it?
What would you do with friends? 
Sounds like you lucked out_comma_ make sure she knows how special she is :)
Yes_comma_ don't let a night go by without saying I Love You.
That makes a lot of sense. I wouldn't be happy either! I hope that they have good insurance
Wow! That's aweful. Is your mom ok?
Man that really does stink! Hopefully the police will find some way to catch the guy!
What kind of tricks can you do?
Thats pretty cool! I am fascinated by that!
Does he have a bad back or was it just an enormous thing?  Did you get to go over?
Oh my goodness!  That's awesome!  Does that feel weird to know he's going to be a Dad?
Those have got to be some good memories for you!
Yeah life really comes at you fast huh?
Whats happening tomorrow?
Oh wow that sounds like fun_comma_ your a great uncle!
Kids can be so annoying sometimes.  I hate those shoes with wheels that they have.  so annoying
I just saw a girl wearing them at walgreens tonight.  I wanted to trip her lol
What rides did you go on?
I hate rollercoasters too!
Sounds relaxing_comma_ being a mom I could use a day like that! 
I hope it was a good day for you_comma_ atleast you did something productive and got some laundry done haha
That's pretty gross. It happens though. Did they comp you?
Great! They should get a great review as we all have hair everywhere. It's bound to happen at  some point.
How long have you been sick?
Wow_comma_ that's a lot. Is it clearing up?
Wow!  Impressive!  He must be beaming and you must be so proud!
I bet his face was priceless when he found out!  Those are the best times in life!  Take him out for vegan ice cream!
I'm impressed you didn't explode!  My wife would've gone insane.  She hates that kind of stuff.  How long did it take to clean up?
What I've found is everything is salvageable if you really want/need to.  I recommend looking on YouTube to see how to remove the oil from the fabric.  Keep your head up_comma_ you'll be alright!
I know there will be something on there!  YouTube has taught me more about life than my parents.  In 20 minutes you will know how to clean your couch and take the engine out of your car.
oh those places are fun.  Its like dinner and a show..  Was it expensive?
thats smart.  We went to one for my wifes birthday once and it cost a fortune!
Are you moving?
I went on vacation about 4 months ago_comma_ it was really fun. I went to Orange Beach_comma_ AL
They are really bad especially if you have pets.
Yea. You have to be careful with flies_comma_ because they can lay eggs in your pet's food.
Was it good?
I have never tried it
Wow_comma_ you must be proud! How old is he?
They grow up so fast! Glad he isn't scared anymore.
You got a day off? Man I wish I could get a day off
Was it fun?
how did it turn out
thats cool that you made it through
Oh boy!  Congratulations are in order then?!!  How many kids do you have then? 
I totally get it.  If I found out that I was pregnant right now_comma_ I'd pass out and cry for a few minutes and then be happy.  ha ha.  I pray for your wife and her body! he he.
I would be disappointed in him if I were you.  He sounds like a real low life.  Maybe you should kick that bum to the curb.
I don't_comma_ if it were up to me we would all be artificially inseminated and men would be kept like livestock.
What did he do?
Cool!
sheesh thats a great deal! 
how many packs did you stock up with? lol
Why_comma_ What happened?! I hope your dog is okay.
Oh man_comma_ I'm sorry. My two dogs are my babys_comma_ I can't imagine how you feel.
Is she?  That's pretty awesome!!  How'd you land her?
Sweet!!!  Did you have a good time?
Yeah I bet.  
10th grade was a good year.  I met my favorite girlfriend that year.  Is he excited?
thats so cool.  what position is he playing?
That's awesome. Will you be relaxing at home or elsewhere?
I love camping. Hopefully_comma_ you won't meet too many mosquitos!
That's awesome! Are you going to go see it?
Wow that's a long way to go. It's really cool you have one opening up near you. 
Congrats! A day off is always nice.  Did you do anything fun with your extra time?
Haha_comma_ relaxing days can be super helpful.  I hope you have a good rest of your weekend!
That sounds nice! Do you enjoy your new home?
That makes a big difference. Getting your feng shui on the go!
$20 bucks?  I'd try to do it too.  How'd it go??
Awesome!  He'll know not to challenge you next time!  $20 bucks richer!
is this her first one?
thats good
Where'd everyone go?
hahaha did you kick family or roomies out?
That sucks. What's going on next week?
I don't think anyone enjoys going to the dentist.
aww im sorry.  did they leave without you
That was really nice of them.  you have some really good friends
That is so scary_comma_ what happened?
Wow_comma_ that is scary! Be careful.
Ohhh Congratulations!  I am sure you will be ok.  Is it your first?
Think of how many people have babies.  If they can do it so can you!
did anyone see ?
oh well you lived through it!
Really? Why was that?
Well there are some good safety apps for your phone that a friend can monitor you as you walk home. Maybe you want to try one of those. 
That's what mom's do! I think it's in our blood.
That is true_comma_not all moms are that way and that is sad.
That's fantastic to hear!
How long have you been married?
Wow_comma_ must've been scary
That's good at least
That's crazy! I wonder if he's stocking up or is cooking for a lot of people.
2 bags and I'm already struggling.
make a plan to pluck her away
dump the first_comma_ and go for her
That's really awesome! Cat's are like the best pets ever. 
Oh... I didn't know those were real. 
Did she pass away_comma_ or did something else happen?
That's sad_comma_ one of my friend's dog died a few years ago. We were all very sad because he was such a nice pit
I don't really trust dealerships. What's wrong with your car?
Ah you're getting maintenance done. That's good.
That is so exciting and different.
I bet so_comma_ that doesn't happen often.
I'm sorry to hear that!
Good luck. Maybe a better opportunity will come around.
i can relate my brothers ex wife _comma_ uses all the child support money on her self and her crack head boyfriend _comma_ my brother buys my nieces close and toys because she wont
its horrible to hear _comma_ but i agree with you 100 percent some people should not have kids at all
That is some dedication.  Did he finally heal up?
I'm glad to hear that he is better now - you did a great thing by helping him.
oh no thats terrible. where do you live?
oh yeah that could be dangerous!
That's really awesome that you have a great partner like her!
Yes I am and my wife is awesome too!
Sharks are definitely scary.
Is where you went known to have sharks?
Wow_comma_ that's very nice of them! Someone taught them well.
Yes_comma_ each kid has their own personality sometimes. I've seen some families that had some kids that were angels_comma_ and one of them was a nightmare!
I am sorry to hear that. I hope she is comfortable at least.
Do you have plans on how to spend these last days with her?
Oh man! I bet you felt bad. 
I am sure she understands it was an accident.
That is so good to hear! What makes her so great!
You have a great wife for sure then.
do you have to pass the gre? 
your husband could probably help you with the math portion!
gotcha... bock bock chicka chicka 
What have you used them on so far? 
They sound like good knives
Did he like it?
They grow up so fast! You must be proud of them though.
Do they bother your stomach?
Oh goodness_comma_ so you have an allergic reaction to them then?  Do you have to carry an epi pen just in case some slip by you unaware?
Significant others can be hit or miss sometimes.
Your husband sounds like a keeper. How long have you two been together?
Have you made an appointment with your doctor?
I would just to be safe!
That's very true_comma_ but I'm sure their both very smart and know how to avoid dangerous situations. 
That will be great! A little peace of mind is all you need. 
thats awesome! what college you go to?
holy smokes thats legit! 
Wow_comma_ that's a terrible situation. Did you report it to the police?
Well that's no very helpful. What about cancelling your card at the bank and reporting fraudulent charges? 
My best friend just told me that they are planning to get a sex change. I had no idea!
He is planning to be a she as soon as she can get the operation scheduled with the doctor. I think I will take at least a few months.
thats awesome! do you guys raise multiple horses?
i would love to be able to have horses
Yes it is very disgraceful.
I know. It is so hurtful to so many involved.
A sub for what?
Oh that sounds good. The closest sub store we have is SubWay.
He must be so precious!
Cherish him while you can. They really grow up fast.
Wow. That's crazy. What even happened?
Someone should definitely report him.
how do you feel about it ? honestly if someone is respectful to me i dont care who they like _comma_ thats the way my dad raised me 
im straight but the way my dad raised me _comma_ he said to respect all sexes _comma_ and what ever religion i choose was up to me _comma_ i have never gone to church 
Oh no!  What happened??
OMG who was it?  What did they do??
AHH!!  Did you call the police?
Did he hurt you??
A trip sounds great! So where are you going?
Florida is a great state to have vacation fun! Can you bring me a seashell back? 
Lol...Thank you the kids and I love to listen to the sound of the ocean through them.
lol i know the feeling. how great would it be to hit a jackpot though
shoot you aint the only one!
I like the Ravens.  People always get hurt in football..
No I my boyfriend had on the Dolphins.. BLAH lol
You must be so excited and proud!
Has he talked yet?
Awesome! I wish I was a better cook.
I believe that!
That's so sad. I'm sorry to hear that. Is he getting a treament? 
Wow_comma_ that's awful. I hope you can tell her all about him and share some pictures at least. 
Wow_comma_ that's not something I'd expect to see just looking out my window at the street!  Were you impressed?
Ha!  Well just make sure you've got good insurance on all of them first!!
Congratulations! Was it your last final?
Good luck. It'll be worth it.
Oh no_comma_ have you tried talking about it?
Give her a few days and try again
That is really great to hear! Couples break up so fast these days.
uh oh how does Facebook help? lol
Did he get it fixeD?
Yeah that's good.  You're a good friend.  Good on you lad!
Oh wow! Congrats! That's awesome!
I would love to go someday.
Ut oh.. are you nervous?
I'm sorry.  Don't worry.  It never is as bad as you think it will be.
I cannot imagine how scary that would be!  Were you home or away?
Do you mean your security system_comma_ or do you mean that which keeps your family secure?
Definitely.  Did you make any adjustments to prevent or protect yourselves after this horrific event?
That sounds like a lot of fun! Did you have a great time?
That was very thoughtful_comma_ you are very lucky!
That's awesome. Is it your favorite band?
You must love music. Are tickets expensive?
man thats legit! i am so lazy lol
i run 1 10k a year lol
that is incredible! congrats is she your first?
its so awesome to have a child! my son is a little over a year
She sounds wonderful. How long have you two been together?
That's really amazing. I wish you two the best.
Haha_comma_ that's funny. The same things used to happen to me except with the game Resident Evil. I love that game_comma_ and was scared to play it at the same time.
Yes! I remember that. I was just looking at getting an emulator so I could play it again on my computer.
i love art if thats what you mean _comma_ i started taking painting classes recently 
Thats awesome i used to do the tattoos and recently purchased 2 tatoo machines a shader and a liner _comma_ been drawing since i was 5 years old
I'm sorry to hear that. 
I wish you healing and comfort.
That's wonderful! What's been going on?
Oh my gosh. Congratulations on the kiddo!
What are you scared of?
I bet you are scared! It will be fun though!
Hey that's great of them!!  Did you get anything cool?
That's fantastic!  What an awesome day_comma_ huh?
hahaha I guess no one warned you about how scary that movie is_comma_ hu?
Good idea. Having someone around might help you recover from it.
Oh no! That's no fun. So you're cancelling it completely or will you wait until you feel better?
That's too bad_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you feel better soon!
how exciting! I love concerts
Honestly I can get into most kinds of music. What artist/band is the concert?
thats awesome! glad to hear that!
it does i agree! its always great when someone gets paid for their hard work
Oh wow I'm sorry_comma_ but your health is more important!
Sounds like you have a great friend! 
I used to have to be on call and I hated it_comma_ especially after I worked all week.
That's true_comma_ that is part of it_comma_ I guess.
Oh that's sweet. What kind of things does he do?
Oh that's very nice! He must work very hard then!
Could be better_comma_ but it's nice to know someone is having a great week!
Oh now I"m just getting jealous!
Oh?  How was it?
That's awesome!  Nothing better than free food!!
what artist is gonna be there_comma_ now i am intrigued 
ooooh nice _comma_ i would be so pumped too see them _comma_ enjoy
ah no thats horrible i hate to hear that
thats legit! i love mma and jiu jitsu is crucial 
Are you excited about that_comma_ do you think you'll be checking it out when it opens.
We have a local pizza place here and it is SO much better than all the chain places.  I hope your's is great also.
Oh I'm so sorry. Is the little one being treated?
I am so sorry to hear that. I'm sure she had the bests life she could being part of your family.
you going one last time ?
yea 
Oh no. Do you know who did it?
A hit and run. Not many people are responsible anymore.
Me too_comma_ people can be so cruel.
It definitely can be.
that is scary! it happened to me as well so i bought a couple of guns
yep us too_comma_ its sad we have to have those
It's always nice to have people around you that care about you. They make hard times much easier.
How's the wrist feeling now? Any permanent damage?
Well take it from me_comma_ I have one and twins on the way.... Never wanted kids either but once theyre here it's an amazing feeling!
You will never be ready but enjoy as  much as you can while you're young! lol
So exciting_comma_ which concert?
Nice! I don't know either band well but sounds exciting!
Good luck! Chess is such an interesting game.
Is he an awesome player_comma_ too?
That must be nice_comma_ having a good family.
Do you have any siblings?
That is kind of sad. I hate it when places from your childhood close or are torn down.
Yeah that is too bad.
Oh yea? How'd it go?
Oh no_comma_ how did mom take it? Did she tease you?
I hate when that happens_comma_ especially when you have something else pictured.
Are you able to send it back?
I can't imagine. How old is he?
Yeah_comma_ that's a hard age to separate from a child. They don't really understand. I have to leave my 16 year old sometimes and he jumps for joy.
That is a nice surprise! Do you usually work every weekend?
I am glad you got this one off!
yea they grow up way too fast
yea
That sounds awesome! What band?
They sound rock metal. Hope you have a great time!
ah that sucks! what city?
dang in the middle of no where
uh oh.. late trip to the local walmart to get more!
sounds like a plan
Was there too much work?
Did you get any help?
how was it? get smashed?
crap that sucks! did you have fun?
Oh that's cool!  Who are you going to see?
Hey I saw Breaking Benjamin a couple years ago at an unplugged concert in Nashville!  You're gonna have some fun!!
Eww_comma_ thats gross! Poor kid needs to learn some manners!
I bet_comma_ I would have had to look away!
I think everyone gets nervous. You'll be fine!
It must be an exciting time_comma_ too.
That is annoying. Do they say anything when you answer?
I don't blame you!
whats his name?
my wife loves that name_comma_ we have a son that will be 2 in december. if we have another one his name will be knox
Who are you going to see?
That will be a fun concert!
It's nice to hear someone thinking about others. Many people who luck out don't care what happens to others or are grateful for their lot in life.
Sounds like you have a great family.
Tell me about it. It's over 100 almost every day here and it's so humid it makes the air feel sticky!
Central Louisiana. Hot and gross out here! Imagine a steaming swamp.
i love Mexican food! salsa is the best
yeah thats true! with a margarita
Oh man_comma_ your dad sounds awesome.
Does he know that?
Yeah? That's a good thing! What's going on in your life right now?
That's awesome! I very happy for you. I hope you have many good years to come as well.
Oh no_comma_ I am sorry to hear that.
I hope you can find some comfort during this time!
That's great to hear!
Not many people are thankful for their family. I am glad you are.
That is good to hear_comma_ it sounds like you are a very loyal employee.
If you find a place that cares for their people_comma_ stay with them!
You must be excited! Will it go on the whole day?
That's still awesome. Have a great time!
what are you playing?
wow that is impressive!!
Sometimes that is good and sometimes it is bad. Depends on how bad you need the money. I hope it was a good thing for you.
Yeah_comma_ I had forgot it was Friday. I always enjoyed getting off early then.
good luck! need something bigger?
yea i feel your pain! we will be buying a bigger home also
That sounds fun_comma_ what concert?
I bet you are going with your dad?
glad to hear that! why?
your husband is a lucky guy!
Wow that sounds lovely_comma_ where are you headed? Some where warm I hope!
That sounds amazing_comma_ I hope you both enjoy it!
You go for it! 
You never know unless you ask_comma_ and it never hurts to ask!
Why? What did he do?
Wow_comma_ that is very nice of him. It's to meet nice guys these days! You're lucky to have him!
oh no!!! Did you put it in rice? 
Sure!  Then cook the rice later!
That's great! Where ya headed?
I hope you have a wonderful time!
i have never tried korean food _comma_ and i love trying different kinds of food i would be so excited 
i would love to try it one day _comma_ im happy for you
Oh god_comma_ I've done many things but that is actually one I have not done.
Hey_comma_ the party was probably worth it.
That's dope. Who's playing?
Don't know who they are.
that always stinks_comma_ i hate being short handed 
man that will be great_comma_ working long shifts aint fun
Fishing is truly fun. We occasionally go with my friends too. Do you go frequently?
That is bad. Do you live in a place with high humidity?
you ever cut it yourself ? or is it too big of a yard?
yea sometimes its relaxing to be out there cutting the grass by yourself 
That's awful_comma_ I hope no one in your family was hurt.
Luckily. In bad situations like that_comma_ it is always best to remind ourselves that things could have been a lot worse for ourselves.
That sounds like a lot of fun! Who are you going to see?
Awesome! They play some good music!
whoa thats shocking! how old is she?
holy smokes thats a huge gap!
we always do that_comma_ its so convenient 
no way its awesome!
You're gonna be tired the next day.
Too bad it's on a Sunday.
That's great_comma_ how long was it on for?
That is a pretty long time to have your leg wrapped up. How'd you injure it?
Yea. After all that_comma_ I think it's definitely time for you to relax and have fun!
You should be proud of yourself really.
Hey that's a good deal!  Where was this?
Yeah that sounds sooooo good right now!  I may need to go to chinese tonight!!
Oh no. What happened?
Oh no. Can you go back?
I'm sure you'll do fine if you practice enough!
Understandably so_comma_ I get nervous during presentations too. Take some deep breaths and you'll pull through!
What show is it?
Is that a play or music band?
that is the worst_comma_ i hate when people cant park
i know the feeling_comma_ there are a ton of people like that too
that sounds cool.. how long has he been competing ?
thats awesome
It's lovely! did you miss him?
Take care of him!
Yeah_comma_ me too! Is your friend working abroad too?
Okay interesting. Well I would guess that she is probably studying right no!
Everyone has their preference.
Aw no luck with the ladies?
whats tomorrow night?
awesome i love mma_comma_ what fighter you like?
Aww that's good for him though!  Who was the band?
That's an awesome band.  So jealous of him!!!  Wish we could've ALL went!
Is it the traffic or driving that gives you anxiety?
Oh gosh. That's not safe at all. 
thats awesome _comma_ one day i want to make it to retirement im happy to hear people work this long_comma_ in my area young people refuse to work all they do is party and live off there familys money
thanks _comma_ and once again thank you for your service in any field contributing to society 
Why were you scared to walk home?
That is pretty terrifying_comma_ but I'm happy to see that you made it through in one piece.
Wow_comma_ that sounds like fun! She's so beautiful.
Yes she does. She's very talented. I'd love to see her live.
That is so scary! People are so desperate these days.
I would have been_comma_ too. I am glad you are okay!
Is that a football team?  I'm sorry_comma_ I'm not a sports fan.  Are they your favorite team?
I hope they perform well this year then!  It's always nice to have a winning team.
its sad once you get older those things dissapear
dirty 30 parties are the best!
What got in the way of your plans?
That's such a shame_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh no! Did anyone help you?
Yeah I can imagine
That is horrible. Do you live in a city or rural areas?
It is unbelievable to meet these wild animals in a city. You should definitely call them
bosses can be such aholes!
yep if it deserves to be yelled at thats one thing
I'm a Reds fan myself........I know the Braves have a good chance of winning their division and I agree_comma_ probably not made for a deep playoff ren.
Yeah....I have no complaints with him.....his salary is too big for the franchise but that ain't his fault.
You must have felt very lonely.
At least you were productive!
what did he tell you ? did he like them as well
when my brother loves the things i love _comma_ it makes me feel good like we are bonding 
thats a shame! did he get any of it back?
thats good_comma_ my house was also broken in to
Hey_comma_ It's never too late. Unless you can't exercise at all there is always a way to start. 
Don't worry about the calories for now. Just start moving more_comma_ and maybe join an exercise class. You'll start to enjoy it_comma_ and before you know it the weight will just start dropping off!
It's not good to be stuck alone. I'm sure you can make friends with someone there!
Take it from me_comma_ you've got to work on getting over that shyness before it's too ingrained in you! I'm still pretty introverted but I enjoy meeting new people now and it helps with my emotional state a ton.
Oh no!  How are you handling the disappointment?
That's a great attitude to have about it.  But I understand that it still stings a bit.  
That is a big moment. Are you a little sad?
I would be a mess_comma_ my son is about to turn two and I am sad about that. Time goes by so fast.
what were you going to get?
i have one and it is awesome
Yeah? How much of a chance do you think they have?
That would be awesome! I hope they do too!
Who knows_comma_ they always choke.
Maybe this year will be their year.
that stinks! hopefully you will get one soon
maybe itll all work out for you!
lol.  Put some headphones on yourself and tune him out!
Maybe you could play your own video games?
Oh.  Maybe watch some cool youtube vids?
That's awesome! Mine has been just fine_comma_ not bad
I hope it continues!
Do you even have a dog?
That's so disgusting. You should catch them one day and drag them to the police station.
oh nice! she will be in my town this weekend
i have hear so as well_comma_ i love concerts
Yeah_comma_ they seem to be doing good this year.
Hopefully so_comma_ maybe they can make a good run this year.
that is so awesome! are you going to pass it down to a family member
that would be so nice to have!
Do you live in Atlanta?  I haven't been to the new stadium yet and I really would like to - have you?
Well hello neighbor!  I'm going to have to get down there one day - I remember way back when they won the World Series I think in 1991 maybe?  It was so exciting!
You think so?   
Awesome!  I'll have to check them out this year.  I'm a cowboys fan LOL
what did you get?
extra money is always great!
That's great. I guess he might be one year old. Am I right?
Good. He is fast growing child! 
What kind are you looking to get?
Awesome_comma_ are you adopting?
I am glad you are getting to leave. I hope you find somewhere safe. 
That sounds like a plan.
that is awesome i would feel the same way _comma_ i want to be a father one day i am really happy for you
you made my day _comma_ hope everything goes well 
lol dude is living the life
lol he has no cares which is always good
That's great! What kind of show?
Oh sweet! I'd love to go to one of their shows myself. I hope you have a great time.
Good_comma_ credit and debt are bad things.
What you are saying is true. Me too_comma_ I hate paying fpr interests.
Take the knife and destroy it the next time it lands. That way they will learn a valuable lesson
Kids can be annoying and such outcomes can teach them on how to properly behave
Hey that's amazing!!  What did you major in?
That's pretty cool!   I'm so glad for you!  I bet that was a lot of paper writing :D
What show?
That sounds fun_comma_ those are always exciting.
oh no what does she do?
thats sad_comma_ i hate to hear that
Are they doing good so far?
That's awesome!  I hope they win it all !  They really are a great team.
Oh no! Did they steal a lot?
I bet! Did they damage anything?
That is nice. How long have you been married?
That is great.
are you confident you will pass?
great! i hope that you do!
I don't blame you_comma_ that is so scary! I am glad you are okay.
I hope they do_comma_ too. That is a dangerous person.
That's really awesome. Your friends sound really great!
Make sure you do something good for them in return!
I bet it was nice to have extra help.
Your sister sounds pretty awesome
Oh no!  I know how violated that can make you feel - did they ever get caught?
I can understand that!  Otherwise you are just wondering all the time who it is and if they will come back.  I hope you were able to get some security systems in place to help feel more at ease.
Yeah the new places are always really busy when they first open too!
Yeah same here
where you going ?
nice _comma_ i have a friend who lives in florida hope you all enjoy it there
I know_comma_ right. I miss seeing the phone booths everywhere. 
Wow! I haven't thought about them in years. I can't remember the last time I saw one. 
My daughter is thinking about that career track.  Is it hard though when an animal doesn't make it?
That would be the only thing that would keep me from it.  I admire those that care for our animals_comma_ so thanks to you for being you.
That sounds like fun. How do you feel about it?
That sounds like a great time!
what beach are you going to?
i was born in savannah!
I don't know much about baseball but I went to a Braves game a few weeks ago and it was fun
Yes it is! We walked all around it
that is scary to me_comma_ i hate bikes
i agree they have regard for anyone else
Why are you saying like this?
indeed they are so good
Holy cow that's amazing!!  Do you think you'll like this new job?
That's really great!  I'm happy for you!  Knockem dead!
Did you guys have a nice celebration?
I love catfish! I'm glad you were able to enjoy a nice celebration with your mom.
Oh_comma_ that is the best. It's so nice to have a great friend. 
I can see that. But she loves you for you and not for what you can afford. 
I am the same lol I walk fast. Too fast sometimes
LOL you get there faster
How interesting
Don't worry though. He will be home soon!
That's wonderful that you are looking out for them like that.
Awesome! I'm sure they will all do their best!
Those don't sound like friends. I'd be extremely pissed off!
Yeah_comma_ don't let them lie to you. I don't know them_comma_ obviously_comma_ but that sounds like an excuse to me too.
What were they looking for?
I can't imagine how anxious that must have made you. I am glad it turned out to be benign. 
I'm sorry to hear that. That's a pretty common response to break ups. A lot of people go through it_comma_ so you're not alone! I hope you pull through soon.
That's great to hear! I'm sure you'll find someone better soon.
hell no it does not _comma_ these people out here stealing that is exactly why im afraid of buying from e bay _comma_ a lot of bad reviews 
i would be really upset too _comma_ i have received defective merchandise too and its upsetting _comma_ waiting for the product for 1 week and checking the mail every day _comma_ only to get it broken
Oh congratulations! That's wonderful news.
I am very happy for you. I wish you all the best!
Yum I love buffets!
Yes_comma_ so many options
That is such a bummer have you spoken to him about this issue?
That may be a issue I mean you want to trust\t your significant other but as women we know the changes and signs trust me.
Oh that is great! Were you High School sweethearts?
That is a great accomplishment since most marriages don't last very long. Congrats! 
Oh. I love red hairs. I have always admired their unique genetic characteristic that sets apart from others
You know what_comma_ i have always secretly wanted to date red hair as a partner and I hope I will one day
Oh no!  Have you spoken to her at all since she left?
That is so sad to hear!  Perhaps after she cools down a bit ya'll will be able to work it out.
Yes it is. It's like you turn around and 10 years has gone by. 
Wouldn't that be great. Think of all the changes we could make. 
That's incredible! You must feel on top of the world!
I'm sure all the hard work and effort you put in to it really shows. I am trying to get in shape myself_comma_ and your story is inspiring!
I
I'm so sorry to hear that do you try andspend a lot of time with her so she doesn't feel that way?
That is great to hear now she has to build even more memories with you and your family so the loosing of your dad can get better for her.
What's happening next month?!
Oh_comma_ wow! That's awesome. What beach are you going to?
Uh oh!!!  Better go investigate!
Yeah that would suck.  You should throw some peanuts or corn up there.
haha do it!  Not like you'll be sleeping tonight anyway!
haha YES!  Sounds like a fun Friday night :D
Oh no! Maybe you can plan to enjoy a picnic the following weekend.
Sorry to hear that. Hope the weather is better next time!
Oh that's cool! What kind of concert is it?
Oh that's a big one! That should be an amazing show!
Oh no! I hope it wasn't something that caused you real distress. 
OMG! Bless your heart. I hope they feel guilty now knowing what they did to you. 
Nothing like mail to brighten up your day! What was it?
What a great gift! I have always wanted a Polaroid instant camera!
Did he arrive back early?
I bet you were extremely happy. A year without seeing a parent can be a very lonely feeling.
That is so sad. I am sorry. Losing a pet is so hard. They are family.
I know the feeling. The thought of replacing them seems impossible. Only time will tell if you are ever ready for another.
That is so awesome and a great accomplishment do you plan to write more in the future? 
Science was never my strongest but I admire those who love it because they are super smart I hope your next article makes it into a even bigger news article. 
Yikes! You got one of the bad ones. They sure makes things hard. 
Maybe he needs to break away from her a bit. Maybe then she will mind her own business. 
That's awesome! Will it be your first time?
Nice_comma_ it's always fun even if you've been before.
ugh I hate when that happens... when I worked in retail my boss always called me
I actually liked retail but the customers and the schedule sucks lol
Did you?  How did that work out?
Oh no :(   I'm so sorry.   There's always adoption!
OO are you going to the beach soon?
That should be so much fun_comma_ seeing his face when he first puts his feet in the water will be amazing!
Wow_comma_ that is awesome! How long does that take?
That is really great! Your fitness and health are very important to take care of.
what you planning on giving her ?
shes gonna be very happy _comma_ i would do the same for my mom
No_comma_ I don't. What are the teams playing?
Nice. I didn't know about it.
Well_comma_ you should call 911. He might be dangerous anytime for the people in the surroundings
you ought to be careful
Glad to hear you found it I know your heart was racing to find it especially if it was your favorite. 
Have to be much more careful next time maybe get a box to put it in. 
Oh no. I hope they will be able to find out soon what is causing them. 
Bless your heart. I hope they find out and it's something they can treat it easily. 
That's nice. It's good to be supportive
That creates a great work environment
Awe_comma_ how cute! That is such a blessed moment.
That's really cool to see their development and their growth.
What could you have found in that dark_comma_ dusty place?
Wow! Great find! I bet you was super happy.
That sounds like a blast. Wish I could be there! 
Sorry to hear that how did things turn out did you two make it work or going through the process now? 
He has to be happy if he still there marriage is important and he has to be open in communication with you instead of pulling the divorce card. 
what was it ? 
lol _comma_ we have possums down here _comma_ they get in the attic all the time too 
That's what I like to hear. What do you do for a living?
Ah_comma_ the good ole side hustle. I like that. You should check out "Side Hustle" by Chris Guillebeau. I'm looking to start something myself. 
That was nice_comma_ did you ever get the moneyback?
How long ago did you lend them this money?
ah_comma_ thats being a good brother. Is your brother alright now?
good to hear that!!
Wow - what is the raffle for?
That would be an awesome win!  I think the most I've ever won was $1 on a scratch off lottery ticket haha!  I hope you win!!
That sounds like fun! Where did you guys end up going?
That's awesome! I can't wait to take my daughters to disney
every time a loved one dies its never good news _comma_ even if its a pet 
i love dogs _comma_ they just want someones attention _comma_ they are loyal till the end
Whoa_comma_ that is really impressive! How much do you bench now?
It's cool to always remember those milestones. Helps to keep us motivated.
oh! that's really fabulous
why_comma_ what is the reason ?
Oh no_comma_ that is heartbreaking.  How is she and her mother holding up?
I can't even imagine.  I hope she has some great men in her life that can help to be that father figure for her.
That sounds very nostalgic. How old is she now? 
It is indeed. I wish i could back to my childhood times. No hassle_comma_ no stress of paying bills. Adulthood is really difficult
Yeah_comma_ i feel some are just picky on what job they want to have
I agree with you
i have to stay late at work all the time _comma_ im sorry to hear that 
yes it does lol
I'm sorry - what exam are you talking about?  Did you take an exam?
Do you think you did well on it?
lol_comma_ sounds like a cool type of work
what?
oh why is that?
oh it sounds fun. You should try it once. You will enjoy it. You will be scared for the first time_comma_ but you will be okay
Hey that's awesome!  Where are you going for vacation??
Oh I'm so jealous!  I bet that place is beautiful!!
Maybe you can park a bicycle or skateboard there.
Dang! Tell your friend to go find a new spot!
Oh wow! That is great. Did she have a good day?
I don't blame you. It's so sad to know that you have to leave them there. 
thats good _comma_ was it a 1.00 scratch off ?
i would be happy too _comma_ but i would probably buy 20 tickets after and lose in every single one with my luck
YEs because they never want to hang out unless they bring their partner lol
I've been in that situation many times lol
That's awesome! I hope you do great.
Good luck!!
I bet you had some good times when she was a baby!  How old is she now?
haha I bet she's a doll!  Cherish these moments!
I am sorry_comma_ maybe you can hang out with some friends
I hope you feel better!
Aww!  Why?
Oh no!!! Is she okay?
Why and what did happen?
It's funny! 
Wow! That is gross_comma_ did you kill it?
I hope you lit it on fire!
Such things are very rare if you use services from reputable delivering companies. What carrier did you use for your delivery?
It is very unusual. UPS is very competitive company and they should have resolved the issue quickly
Oh no! Did you get a police report and exchange information?
It's always good to exchange the information to make sure that they follow up about that. Hope your car gets fixed soon.
That is definitely something to celebrate!
Do you have big plans?
Oh no_comma_ that's a horrible feeling
Uh oh! Maybe time to move on
What is going to happen in September?
Wow! I bet he will love that. 
That is great that you are going to take him. He will always remember it. 
That is great news. What job was it for?
When will you know if you got the job?
Good luckk!!
Yes dont give upQ! I bet you'll find something good
oh i know what you mean
thats very annoying
Whoa_comma_ were you in a hurry? Did something happen?
Luckily nothing happened_comma_ but better to be safe while driving.
Well_comma_ that will be great! Where are y'all going?
We just got back from there 2 weeks ago_comma_ we stayed at Miramar Beach. I'm sure it will be a lot of fun and relaxation!
Right. What is the purpose of going to movies if people talk there. Uninformed people everywhere
You should confront them next time if it happens. They should be put in their place for improper social behavior
Are you going to get it fixed?
Will she give you any money for the repair?
Oh_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that. It's very hard to lose a loved one_comma_ I know from personal experience.
Yes_comma_ even though death is part of life_comma_ it's very hard. I hope things are better for you.
Awe shucks_comma_ what stopped you?
Well I do hope you get to have your hike soon! I'm sure if you keep putting in the work it will pay off eventually.
oh well_comma_ whats the show. i know for sure you would have enjoyed it again
nostalgic isnt it?
That is terrible news. How did he die?
I lost my friend to a heart attack. He was only 35.
Oh really? I can imagine
oh thats too bad but i bet you will do fine
Oh_comma_ well that doesn't sound good. But_comma_ maybe you have good reasons?
Oh_comma_ well_comma_ in all honesty_comma_ it probably won't last if he's a bad guy anyway.
Oh no_comma_ how did that make you feel?
It happens. But next time you;ll be more aware
Well that's very sweet of him! 
I always love surprises like that. And a new laptop is a pretty big deal. Enjoy it!
oh i didnt get a chance to see the game
wow thats insane
What did you do after they cut you off?
Did you at least honk your horn?
That sounds so annoying to deal with.
Without a doubt_comma_ most drivers are total morons.
ah that bad!!. You need again to wait for ages!!
When you see them again it will be worth a wait!!
wow good for you man
dang that is so awesome
Did you make friends eventually?
How did you get through it?
I'm not sure I've ever used them. I think my earliest music media was cassettes.
That's cool. The history of them are as well_comma_ Sometimes_comma_ it's nice to use something from the past.
That's awesome. How'd he do?
Nice. I bet you were so proud.
You definitely should cherish these moments.
How did your sister react?
How did that make you feel?
That's alright. She's family_comma_ so she will still love you. Just learn from this mistake. 
Oh wow_comma_ why?
Damn_comma_ hopefully you're doing better now.
What went wrong?
Did you use Tinder again?
With Trump in the presidency_comma_ it won't end soon.You can bet on that
You know nothing about politics_comma_ go watch soap operas
So you consider yourself total loser in life?
It is pathetic and unacceptable. You should grow up and stop being so irresponsible
Did it hurt?
Did you go to the doctor?
yea thats fair_comma_ ive done the same thing
haha that might be too far
that was my favorite game ever
same_comma_ it was awesome
That's pretty good reflexes on his part.
So many of my friends have cracked phones so I guess mine are clumsier. 
Same! That is why I never go outside and just be on my computer all day!
You got this! Fake it until you make it!
Maybe you shouldn't go then.
Hopefully nothing bad will happen.
ah so sad for you_comma_ where did he/she moved?
oh yeah_comma_ nice pace though but you will miss him a lot i guess!!
I imagine that was a big surprise! Did you ever mention to him?
Well_comma_ I can relate. My sister and I found some playboy magazines nosing around too!
I am sure there will be another chance.
Maybe you should buy him lunch to make a peace offering.
What happened? Is there anything specific that makes you feel that way?
Then why don't you go shopping? Is it because you have financial difficulties?
I somewhat disagree. It's been so hot I'll be happy to see the end of summer.
That is a pretty good tradeoff.
Is the phone working?
Did he get dirty when he dove?
oh that must be scary
wow well good luck
I would think they are now. Are they already closed down for the summer?
Oh_comma_ I see. Well_comma_ they are a lot of fun!
What makes you think that?
That's pretty much the same reason that I don't want kids.
I never use Tinder due to that reason.
Have you ever tried any other apps?
Yikes!  Did you study real hard for it?
Aww.  I think you will do okay!
thats awesome
thats so cool_comma_ good for him
How come. I can't imagine weddings without the presence of parents. You should convince her to come
But it is you who choose which girl to marry and which one not. You should try to explain it to her that old days are over
Have you studied?
You will do fine_comma_ I know it.
Sounds like a fun event. What all is there to it?
Yes_comma_ that would be quite fun! My children will not go to haunted house_comma_ no matter how much we try to bribe them lol
That's so great! Most people aren't.
I know some people that eat healthy_comma_ but still struggle with their weight. So_comma_ that's great you don't!
Wow_comma_ so far I've just had a girlfriend for a week and got laid a few times.
True_comma_ though I just wish girls weren't so shallow sometimes.
That is good_comma_ you shouldn't even go on Tinder.
That wasn't ever nice of her.
Really?  I've always wanted to see them!  When did you go
Awesome!  So glad they're still rocking after all these years!
Where do you shop?
Where is the trip to?
oh thats really cool_comma_ good luck
seems like a tough sport
Did you apologize to them?
It ok_comma_ mistakes happen.
You should go out and meet new people.
Do you have friends now?
yea i agree
they are important to the ecosystem but i wish they would stay away from me
When is the test?
That is good_comma_ you must of studied a long time.
wow that must have been a huge moment for you
well good for you
Uh ohh!  Did you honk at them?
Yeah.  I'd say so.  I can't stand bad drivers!
oh man mustve brought back memories
wow that sucks so bad
You can at least phone them.
You can go visit.
Nice association. Do you have any memory attached to it?
Do you visit her often?
That's so wonderful! I had a very close relationship with my sister too. I always treasured it and loved her so much!
That's so great. My sister was mine too. She passed away several years ago_comma_ so never take him for granted and treasure every moment with him!
oh wow that sounds really tough
well good luck with that
That is horrible news_comma_ so sorry.
How did he die?
oh you did? what was it about?
dang thats a bit low
Did you pull over to help?
That was nice of you.
What did they do to make you proud?
That is good news. What kind of job?
Oh no_comma_ when did that happen?
How old are you? It's more rough when you're young.
Sorry to hear that.
How did he die?
is there a chance you wont?
hopefully you get it
Why? Must be something fun and exciting going on?
Oh_comma_ well no doubt that will be fun! I like that it isn't fake_comma_ like wrestling.
That is great you have friends.
How often do you see them.
thats so cool.
thats great_comma_ happy for you
Same here_comma_ he must make so much money.
I totally agree.
Why was that?
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
oof was it the cost?
yikes thats quite a sum of money
Did you call a tow truck? LOL.
Did you ice your toe?
That's great! But_comma_ what is it?
Oh_comma_ okay! Well_comma_ I love some Blackjack. I like Poker_comma_ but better at Blackjack. But_comma_ not on your level by any means! Good for you!
Oh that sucks!  Why did he/she make you work??
Yeah I've worked for bosses like that in the past.  At least you get overtime?
That's cool. Is he smart?
What position does he play?
Are they? Damn I can't believe I didn't hear.
Agreed_comma_ that would be badass.
What was the name of the film?
I love that movie.
Oh_comma_ well it happens sometimes and can't be helped. But_comma_ I understand why it would make you feel bad too!
I'm sure it probably upset them_comma_ but maybe they realize it was for a reason. And I'm sure they've done the same thing.
thats so cool.
wow thats impressive
Did anyone get hurt?
Did you yell at the other person?
wow thats so horrible
hopefully well
Wow_comma_ that is pretty cool
And when did this happened?
That's awesome!  College or high school?
That's great to hear!  What is his major?
Yes_comma_ I have many great weeks.
What happened to make it great?
Did you not study for it?
Hopefully you learned a lesson from this experience. If you want to do well you need to be prepared.
That was nice of her!
Make sure to tell her that!
I could imagine. Were you two very close?
It's good to have that close bond with your siblings_comma_ though.
What is the issue?
Won't you still be able to see her?
ah you used her. You should have filled. But however she will understand
oh mom's will be mom. she will forgive you
Do you like it?
Which color is it?
How many people entered?
That isn't a lot of people but still a good job.
I don't think I know that band. But_comma_ I'm sure you will have lots of fun!
Well there ya go_comma_ I didn't know. The Weeknd sounds like a band_comma_ more than just one person.
Anything in particular?
You need to catch up.
Your high school yearbook?
How old are you?
When do you think it will happen?
You think so?  Do you have a plan for the end of the world?
Oh? What made you so mad?
Oh I hate that too. Just let me buy what I need to buy and leave.
Did you manage to get it?
As long as you keep the GPA to what you need though
Did you pass?
I am glad for you
OMG...how gross. What did you do?
LOL....I think that's when I would start crying.
What's happening next week?
Really! They are so much fun
DEfinitely. It's an adrenalin rush
Sticks and stones..
Hey that's great!  That makes for an awesome day.  It's not quite daylight here yet.
Yeah.  It's usuallty around 0600 here when it gets light.  It's only 3 here now though
Yeah I'm sure it will.  Enjoy your beautiful day!
Thank you so much :D
That is kinda sad
Did you talked to her after?
Ew_comma_ that's pretty gross since the floor is probably dirty as hell.
Especially in public when people can see you do it.
LOL_comma_ well_comma_ they must have been very good then. We all overindulge at times_comma_ so don't feel too bad.
Well_comma_ it can be hard to resist sometimes. But_comma_ maybe just eat a bit healthier for a few days_comma_ and it'll make up for it.
OH yeah! It's so painful. Did you do that today?
Things will get better from here on out
They call that Post traumatic Stress Disorder
I think you should
I'm sure you're gonna nail it!   What is the job?
Have you worked in one before?
Cool.  So you have some good experience.  I'd say this new job is yours!  Good luck!
You're welcome my friend.   It's their loss if they don't hire you!
Every single one? That's messed up.
I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.
Wow_comma_ that is a good friend
Nice_comma_ did you passed the test?
That situation can make you apprehensive. What would be making him upset?
I think that your Dad will be more concerned about you being injured than scolding you. Go home.
Oh thats bad. you should have really given them your piece of mind. Driving skills of people going down
yeah that's good really
Cool - how did it go?
Good. Have you arranged to meet again?
Brilliant. It's like having a new friend.
Was it that bad?
And why was that?
Was it good news?
That's has to be a relief. Hopefully he won't fall off the wagon. With alcoholism it's one day at a time.
That's the worst_comma_ especially when you see employees doing nothing.
Well thankfully it's over now.
Do you think you could overcome it?
I cheer for you to make it
Well it would have been nostalgic!!. You would have enjoyed for sure
old is gold saying is so true. All our memories comes up.
Did you passed the test?
Oh_comma_ I'm so sorry_comma_ can yo retake the test?
That's nice of him! How long did it take?
Not bad at all!
That's great. How old is she?
Lol. Do you see a lot of her?
LOL....Been there and done that. Don't feel guilty. What's done is done.
No need beating yourself up something you can't change. Got another pack?
Why does he need surgery then?
I hope it does too!
oh feel sorry for you. I just hope you will get it next time
you will get it don't you worry about it
When is the interview?
I hope you get the job
What is the job about?
Oh_comma_ very good_comma_ I work with a charity too
Thats terrible. Some people are scumbags.
Did you contact the police?
Sounds like a perfect day.
Glad to hear it_comma_ I hope I have a day like that soon.
Do you know how to do it correctly now though?
Well - you live and learn.
Oh_comma_ I would've freaked out
Sounds like a safer option_comma_ any idea on how it got in?
Perhaps it would be wise to close them at night
Perhaps then put something so they cannot get in
Well done! What kind of car did you get?
Wow. Are you happy with it?
I wish I was patient enough to save like that
I'm impressed. You should be proud of yourself.
That's great. How old is he now?
I'm pleased for him. Hopefully he'll be the next Usain Bolt.
Chain of command do work. We can't help it_comma_ I feel the same
Indeed it ought to be
What kind of dead bodies?
I understand your feelings.
Why is that?
If they don't want to have anything to do with you because you are poor then they are pretty shallow and dispicable. I've still got the pigs if you want to get rid of them.
Why did it make you upset?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Wow he must be pretty loaded.
I've never even owned a car_comma_ never mind an Audi!
It does_comma_ any recent event that made you feel like that?
Oh_comma_ I am happy for you
Awesome_comma_ congrats was this during a college course?
Was is a general eduaction class or one towards your major?
Well good luck for you. you don't like your old one?
i am sure_comma_ you will get it. I pray for you
No. Why not?
That's important. Maybe you're right to stick with it there.
Oh wow_comma_ that sounds like something I wouldn't do
Why was he doing it
Other countries sure are weird
Really? What game did you get?
Is it good?
Yeah - feels better when you've paid for it yourself.
So she should be. WEll done.
Since when?
Is it your favorite necklace?
What car did you get?
Not bad at all!
What kind of test?
Good. Well done. When do you find out?
Oh what kind of pizza?
That sounds so good!
I hope you are prepared
Everything will go fine_comma_ all you have to do is be yourself
Why do you say that?
Really? Thats disgusting
Me neither. I spoke to someone who had seen a show about a guy eating a live squid. Yuck!
Some of them
I'm sorry to hear that.
You will be just fine.
that sucks!! you should have been really annoyed with the delivery boy!
Yeah!! you should refused to take the pizza and returned it
You can only do your best in an unexpected situation.
It's like Larry Gelwix says "What's Important Now?" - what is the best course of action right this second to improve performance. It's inspiring.
Was it from someone you knew?
What was it?
What made him not speak well in your eyes?
That seems like he needs to be let go then.
Oh_comma_ that's awful to hear_comma_ how did yo react?
Oh_comma_ that sounds like an awful lie_comma_ what did you do after?
Were they trying to steal from your car?
I would be too_comma_ so that's understandable.
Oh_comma_ did you go?
Then all is well.
Is it for a hourly wage job or salary?
Was it in a field that you wanted to be in_comma_ or just because you needed a job?
Once or twice. What happened to make you ask?
That's terrible - recently?
Is it an absolute mess inside?
Such a shame. 
That is really impressive.
I could use some burgers myself right now.
That is terrible_comma_ my friend.
I feel so bad for you.
Oh_comma_ that is awful_comma_ did it sting you?
Oh_comma_ I'm glad_comma_ where was it?
That's quiet funny though
Yeah - what did she do?
Really? Was it good? I've never eaten there.
Good. What did you have?
Oh_comma_ what did you get?
That sounds really cool.
Did you lose weight?
I am so happy for you.
Oh damn! How long ago was that?
Hopefully that isn't too big an issue.
Oh no. Will you get it back OK?
It's frustrating when that sort of thing happens
Oh no_comma_ what happened?
Things will get better.
Do you cheer for a specific team or just watch the matches?
Oh_comma_ that's pretty cool_comma_ are they good?
Really? Did they find out?
Did you not feel that you should admit it? How did you accidentally eat it anyway?
You are a terrible person. If someone ate my cake I'd be heartbroken!
Buy him another cake. 
I guess no. Have you?
Awful. It doesn't happen to anyone. 
For music?
How many counties are you planning on vistiing?
That is a bad cat.
Did you clean it up?
homeless people can be good sometimes but sometimes its just annoying
thats fair
Arrgg - so annoying. 
Did you shout at him?
nice
a bit late for that
Really? What was the address? No - only joking. 
Maybe.
Oh yeah? What was on it?
Ooo that's nice of them!
That is the worst thing ever.
I hope things get better.
Oh man_comma_ that's a bummer_comma_ how did that happened?
Was she honest about it or did you find out the hard way?
Me too. Who do you support?
I hope they do well for you
Perhaps some pigs helped you out with that?
You are so brilliant.

That seems weird to me
That's annoying. Why is she doing that?
Oof that isn't good_comma_ sorry to hear man.
Really? It's a nice car to drive.
Me too! Must have cost a lot.
That sounds so amazing!
I am so happy for you!
Really? Cool. What did you do?
Ahh - so they were like a free gift?
It's pity. But why are you alone?

Oh that's awkward haha.
Oh_comma_ not good_comma_ how did that happened?
I could imagine it was_comma_ did someone got hurt?
Were they being rude to you?
Ugh! She was probably doing it on purpose to annoy you!
yea it feels so bad
wow that really sucks_comma_ im sure you will bounce back
Is she sick or was it was one time thing?
Was it a new rug
Scumbag! How can we find out who?
There must be some way. Let's look at the suspects.
Why are you so lonely?
Oh_comma_ you and your silly pigs.
That is so great of you.
I am very happy for you.
sounds scary
good luck with that then
Why you say that?
That is such a shame to hear_comma_ you could try having an imaginary friend
He sounds like a bad influence
Good_comma_ don't get rid of the only friend you have
Maybe you've still got time to do some prep.
Is tehre anyone you could ask to help you prepare?
well the odds are quite bad but that still sucks
yea i can imagine
Nice_comma_ have you heard back yet?
Hopefully you will get it if you prepared well!
That must be such an amazing feeling!
Well I'm really happy for you_comma_ man.
Good thing is you had an alternative. How did your date go?
I hope you can find a way to convince her if you really like or love her
Oh_comma_ how did that go?
That is an interesting meeting.
You too? One of mine died from food poisoning recently. What are you going to do?
You know what they say_comma_ don't you? "You can always buy a new pig - just don't_comma_ under any circumstances_comma_ involve the cops"
Did you have notecards?
Was it about a proposal?
I think I have_comma_ it made me feel bad. have you?
Do you feel bad about it now? I think you do but sometimes we have to do hard things in life.
Oh_comma_ did you get it?
I wish you all the best.
wow thats crazy
i would be too
How did that go then?
I'd hope so too!
wow thats awesome
i bet it did
Yuck. I suppose some people need to do that to survive though
Really? Did you say anything to them?
What did they say?
Oh_comma_ so scary_comma_ what was it?
Oh_comma_ sounds like you should replace it
Oh my_comma_ that is so disgusting. Why would you watch something like that?
Oh I see_comma_ I don't think I would be able to eat something like that!
Yeah - how old were you?
What game did you have?
Dang that's annoying.  Is there anyway you can still get a similar job?
Yeah that's understandable.
oh really?
yea nostalgia is a real kicker
What do you mean?
That's really strange of them haha.
Yeah - what will you be studying?
Ahh - when you are home do you have to share?
wow thats quite rude of them
i can imagine
Aw did you feel lonely? I was like that too but I found friends in my second year.
Don't worry_comma_ hit the gym and join student clubs.
That should be a crime!
I would be too_comma_ it must have tasted disgusting! What a waste of nachos. 
What did the voice say?
I thought the voice was telling you to feed the pigs again.
oh really? that makes me feel rubbish too
def worth it
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that. Did you know him well?
Yeah - it can be upsetting
maybe buy one then? gotteeem
5 likes in the chat?
That's pretty bizarre.
Whopped in the beak by that glass.
You must have felt hopeful_comma_ where did you apply?
I see_comma_ I think you will get the job
Really - recently? The temperature there can get REALLY high can't it?
What kind of treasure?
oh that sounds quite nice
oh yea?
What cartoon was it?
Oh those were the good old days.
seems worth it tho
nice
That's annoying
I would be too so that's fair.
Sounds pretty unfun to me
Glad to hear that the studying paid off
yea i know how that feels
yea it feels extra bad
wow thats awesome_comma_ must feel nice
hopefully i also reach that point
Do you feel bad about it? You should be more careful next time.
As you should bee. but its okay_comma_ we are all human and make human mistakes some times.
dang thats impressive
nice job
Man that's the worst.
Feels so good man
He must be a good player!
You must be a great parent!
Oh no_comma_ you must have been very scared. 
Did you get away? Why was the dog chasing you in the first place?
Why don't they eat lunch with you?
I'm sorry to hear that.
That does not sounds good! Are you proud of him for standing up?
I am glad for him. Bullies should not be allowed to behave badly towards others.
That's good_comma_ how old is your son?
Oh he is quite a grown man. I bet you wanted to catch up on old time growing up with him
Do you have certain expectations for your son?
That's something for which to be proud!  Why don't you feel good about it?
Oh that sucks.  What is it that she does?
They're professional naggers.  It's just what they do.
That awesome_comma_ must have been a proud moment for you both.
That sucks. Is there no way of getting them out?
foids are trash ree
get me some dat respect
That's good to hear that his hard work paid off
True_comma_ a month is not too long.
oof those memories can hurt
yea i can imagine
Nice! I hope you feel happy for him and not jealous! 
Yup_comma_ hard work tends to do that.
That is so terrible.
I hope he learns his lesson.
So sorry to hear that. You must feel sad.
Time will heal. Remember you dog for all the good memories. 
Congratulations_comma_ thats great news. How did you propose?
Yeah man_comma_ it would have sucked if she said no.
Why does she get you angry?
I hope things get better you two.
Oh no_comma_ that must have been awkward 
Does he know that that was the job you wanted?
i am the same
yea i know what you mean
Sounds like you had a bad experience. What happened in Washington?
Oh goodness! How did you react?
Wow_comma_ it has served you well
Yes you do that buddy
You must have prepared well in advance to not be nervous!
Good for you! Hard work always pays off buddy.
That's nice of her!  I bet you were shocked when you saw everybody!
That's awesome_comma_ it's nice to feel loved.
Why's that?
That's really nice to hear_comma_ I hope it goes well.
Oh no that sounds really scary!
Luckily you weren't hurt though!
It must have been a very hard decision for you.
I hope so too_comma_ it will take hard work but its possible.
i feel so worried about this its impossible to stay for 15days
oh_comma_ thank god you were escape you have to thank god for doing great things
oh yea same
seems super cool
I'm sorry to hear that.
I hope you are feeling better.
yea i know that tilts me so hard
yea i bet he is
That's good_comma_ think you're gonna get an A?
Yeah hopefully you do pretty well at least.
I was as well. What was it that impressed you most?
Definitely. Hopefully the next World Cup will surprise just as much.
Why's that? Do you think people will assume you are stealing?
That's terrible. I could see how that would stay with you.
Wow that sounds like one tough cookie!
Yeah that's nice but at some point you have to learn your own limits.
oh thats nice_comma_ it's a happy thing to expect a child
Congratulations buddy
That's not too nice_comma_ did you punish him?
Hopefully this was just a one time thing.
I hate eating dinner by myself.  What happened that you ended up eating dinner alone?
I dont like being alone much either.  What would cause you to have bad thought?  Were you scared?
I know the feeling.
It's hard to hold back the truth sometimes.
Sounds like a lot of hard work.
i agree.
That's not acceptable even if he is drunk.
I hope you get to set him straight somehow.
You must be very happy now.
I hope you keep it forever.
thats good of you
yea no problem
Eww_comma_ did you get angry with her?
I hope you didnt abandon her.
I hate cats that throw up.
I am sure your shoes can be cleaned.
wow that sucks
yea hopefully you find it
I know. It seems like I've been up early every weekend for a while now. Really wish I could sleep in!
What can you do when your body refuses to cooperate_comma_ eh?
Why were you so down on yourself about failing?
Thats not a great attitude as you at least must give a go. You only fail if you don't try.
To your partners_comma_ you mean?
You should find a way to be satisfied with just one person.
That's a great gesture! Is this for your first child?
Definitely. Congratulations and good luck!
Why did you do that?
Yeah_comma_ we all were at some point.
thats disgusting
i would be to
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried to talk to a professional about that?
That's terrible. I hope the situation sorts itself out.
That's intense_comma_ what for?
That's awful_comma_ I hope she turns out alright.
You should be confident. 
I am proud of you!
That's good! Keep it up. It's hard to follow routine sometimes
It'll pay off in the end
Same here_comma_ though it is the summer for me.
I guess so_comma_ though I'm tired so I want to sleep.
LOOOLLL I'm the same way I hate their lack of willpower!
Yeah at what point would you not look yourself in the mirror and be disgusted?
I think people find a way to lie to themself_comma_ and convince themselves that it isn't that bad.  body dismorphia.
So sorry_comma_ that must be devastating for you. 
How long does he have left?
Why do you get embarrassed?
I bet you are great at it!
Yuck thats disgusting_comma_ did you throw up?
Was he insane or was it a part of he's culture? 
yes! pizza is on of lifes simple joys_comma_  what is your favorite kind of pizza?
ohhh yes_comma_ NY style is thin crust right?
I am so proud of you!
I wish you the most success!
Yes! thats so fun_comma_ are you excited?
HAHAHAH she probably has no idea whats going on.
No way! hahaha How did you find out?
How embarrassing! lol
omg it must have been quite an experience for you
I hope he is alright now
What do you mean? is everything okay?
WOW! he never came back? thats hilarious and terrible.
Oh that's sad_comma_ are you going somewhere?
Oh yeah I remember that.  Pretty tough.
Yes! me and my buddy go camping every year when it cools off.
Yeah its been WAY to hot here lately to do anything.
That sounds so scary!
I'm sorry_comma_ heights are the worst.
OH NO! I would have been runnning up and down the halls yelling.
Did you find out who did it and publicly spray ketchup all over them.
Sorry to hear that_comma_ thats disappointing when people pull out last minute.
Did you let them know how you felt?
Yes may very well be gay. Nothing wrong with that.  Ive had alot of gay friends.
If you just stay confident and believe in yourself I know you can do it!
I am so happy for you!
Enjoy your time there!
What did you eat? was it delicious.
Pizza is my lifeblood_comma_ along with beer.
Were you excited or annoyed that the driver left them there?
I know the feeling when you get the items you ordered. I think the anticipation os more exciting then actually having them.
yes they are so soft and fun to cuddle to.
HA if only_comma_ If only people told you what they wanted like dogs do.
That is the case for me too!
Yeah_comma_ I know that feeling.
Wow thats a long time to wait for pizza.
did you complain? Or at least ask for a discount.
Was there anything in the pockets?
haha the best would have been the girls phone number
HAHA yes all the time_comma_ and its even worse when they speak.
Ugh_comma_ yes like cant you tell from my body language I dont want to talk.
I bet they don't follow it
welll one day they will see you were right
How old is she now? why do you miss her baby stage?
I see_comma_ she is probably all rambunctious now.
That is some confidence.
I am envious of you.
Have you been studying? how do you feel about it?
great! I just took all of my finals last week.
That sounds somewhat weird.
Ok_comma_ I get it now.
what movie? did you survive the night?
OH my god! the ring scaed me half to death when it came out omg. IM scared thinking about it.
Are you excited for it?
I hope they are attractive.
Oh my_comma_ why on earth did you do that?
As you should be_comma_ you hurt your girlfriend's feelings.
Are you serious? I wish I could do that. Was he apart of a show
Thats awesome- I wish I could do that like that impressive.
yes I have and its not fun at all_comma_ why would you have to break your wifes?
Oh I see_comma_ why would that break her heart?
She sounds like a sweet woman.
I am so envious of you.
me too haha! now they re all painted as molestors.
Thats right.  the world is so scary now a days.
That's a bit shocking_comma_ huh?
Wow I wonder what will happen now
oh my god man_comma_ was it hot?
imagine having a mean boss and having to wear that all day ha
Hooray_comma_ celebrate and have fun until you have to start working and it all begins again.
Be happy dude cause your on to a new chapter in your life. But whatever you do make sure you wake up every day wanting to do it.
why is that?? what do they have that you dont have?
Yesh that can be hard to deal with_comma_ but I believe you will have it all one day too.
Were you nervous and what for?
Oh no_comma_ how old was he? 
why do you feel that way? what is going on?
never be that way! you are amazing and perfect and awesome!
Good job! You must be so proud of yourself.
Maybe its time to launch your art career full time.
thats honestly amazing_comma_ keep it up and never go back.
yes_comma_ i have been fighting my weight my whole life.
That is very mean of them. How did you react?
I hope it wasn't too scary for you and you can laugh it off now.
Oh my god! how have you been bathing?
oh my_comma_ don't lift up your arms!
That sounds bad. Do you feel lonely now?
I agree_comma_ I guess they weren't a good friend after all 
oh now man_comma_ thats terrible.  She didnt deserve such an amazing person like you.
thats no good at all! you may feel better after you sleep yeah?
That must be a great feeling_comma_ huh?
i'm glad to hear that!
Uh oh_comma_ well with all of the things you do for him_comma_ I think he will survive.
LOL I would be slightly upset im not gonna lie.
Does she fulfil every need for you? 
That's so reassuring to hear_comma_ that true love is still out there
what happened? how long have you been waiting?
yay! that is amazing! when do you atart?
Yum! Pizza for breakfast? My favorite.
Yes enjoy the weekend lol
Go back to sleep!
I agree_comma_ just a read a boring book and you will be snoozing in no time
I am sorry to hear that.  Have you tried looking up organizations in your new area to meet people with similar interests?
How about church_comma_ a fundraising activity_comma_ or volunteer opportunity to meet new people?
Aw_comma_ were you too busy to go?
Oh no! I hate when that happens. Are you feeling any better?
Aw_comma_ that's so nice of you! I bet she appreciated it
Keep doing things like that! Parents appreciate little thoughts like that more than we know
Oh man I would be so mad...did he apologize at all
Yeah sounds like he needs a taste of his own medicine lol
That's great! I bet you love that
Haha_comma_ well dogs do that. I highly recommend not letting the puppy lick your face while it's young
I hope it wasn
(*oops).  I hope you apologized to him.  If it was milk_comma_ I wouldn't cry over it too much.  ;)
Aw_comma_ I hope your dog is much better trained now
I never took my dog to doggie school and I regretted it. She could have done with some more discipline. 
That's terrific. Do they speak English there?
That's a good idea. I hope you have fun!
That stinks_comma_ did they give you fair notice so you had chance to find a new place?
I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ I hope you can find something quickly.
Why are people so inconsiderate. Are you ok?
Yea_comma_ it's not enough that you drive safe sometimes.
That's great! I hope she gets it!
Is this for her dream job?
uh oh_comma_ someone is in trouble.
hahaha a party is a light way to put it.
Oh? Is it a family_comma_ group_comma_ or some other meaningful photo?
OH! haha_comma_ well you learn something new every day. Noodles sounds good though
That sounds awesome. Enjoy your day off!
Oh you got the place all to yourself_comma_ too?
Oh my goodness. That's terrible.  Did you take him to the Vet right away?
Do you know whose dog it is?
Wow_comma_ that is coming up soon.  I be you are excited.  Is this your first child?
That was thoughtful of them.  It is always nice to have a fun surprise!
That would be so annoying!
I don't blame you for that. I would do the same.
You get nervous_comma_ hu?
Have you been on a date recently?
That's cool.  Are you a dancer
Cool. Do you like it so far?
That's terrible. How did they do that?
Did it ever get resolved?
What did she say?
Why you shouldn't have text her?
Nice_comma_ what did you order
Well better be careful_comma_ you might end up opening someone else's mail lol
That's awesome. do you usually exercise in the mornings?
I usually feel better when I exercise_comma_ but I've been putting it off.
That's impressive_comma_ was it difficult to make?
I guess it probably requires a lot of practice to get the technique down.
Check-ups can be nerve wrecking sometimes.
I understand that. There are way too many illnesses that are out of our control.
really? i tortoise? i have one in my backyard too!
he is my pet.. i have had him 10 years.. he is about 70lbs now.. got two more little ones inside 
Oh no. Was there no one to walk home with you?
That's good. Do you have to walk home like that often?
what happened?
Good_comma_ nothing happened.
Oh wow. That must be embarassing!
Guess you don't like her anymore then.
Oh that's cool.  Sounds like he's living the dream lol
Do you have any kids of your own...or is he your main / only furbaby
Nice! How often do you get haircuts?
Your hair must grow really quick!
That is good. I am glad to hear that you are comfortable with life.
I am sure your wife feels that she is the lucky one.
That really stinks. Maybe  you both can take some time off of work and be together?
Well you should sit down with him and have a talk with him about it. 
That's terrible news. I hope they are in good hands. Are you okay?
I am glad. But I hope you are doing okay! Get out and meet some cool people (Easier said than done_comma_ I know).
heh well at least you can be here while working
maybe next time
ooooh I would be too!  I had someone dent my car too last week.  I feel your pain!
Nope!  Try paintless dent repair. Its not too pricey and quick fix.
Sorry to hear that. Are you taking him to the vet?
I understand. That is life.
That's really nice of them_comma_ did they help you move your heavy appliances and stuff too?
Oh_comma_ either way that's still very generous of them and I'd certainly be grateful to have someone like that.
thats cool
im staying in.. its raining cats and dogs
What type of pet
Oh that's pretty cool...is it full grown or still a baby
I would have been too. Were you at a store parking lot or at work?
That is so awful. I guess they didn't bother to leave a note?
what happened
oh dang that stinks
Why? What was going on?
That's disappointing. 
What kind of work do you do
Well I'm sure you've both got your own unique skills...what would you say are 3 things you do well?
That's really awesome! What kind of lyrics do you write?
That's really great!
what do you think is going to happen?
ah well good luck
Why do you need a day off?
Nice. Some leisure time is always good.
Haha_comma_ well that's to be expected I guess. Do you play the lottery often?
I think it's fun to buy one every now and then_comma_ but wouldn't be my go-to for entertaining gambling.
Yum that sounds delicious. You're making me hungry.
You should just get a half vegetarian. No need to punish your self like that.
yea tell me about it... im still paying off cc's from when my wife and i were dating :p
heh
Why's that
Oh I feel ya.  No kids yet so I'm soaking up all the freedom I can hahaha
That's great. Practice makes perfect.   
Keep at it. Maybe one day you can start selling those drawings for money.
Congratulations! How long have you been running for?
It's a really healthy hobby to have! They say sitting down is really bad for you.
congrats... how has the first week been?
thats good! keep it up.
That is kind of you. What kind of pet was it?
Oh that would be fun! What was its name?
I remember in highschool we had a biology teacher and the kids kept badgering him about if he had a wife. When he said he didn't but he was happy the way he was_comma_ nobody understood it. It's something I found wisdom in much later in life.
Yeah_comma_ so follow your dreams buddy. If you find someone on the way_comma_ all the better.
Great job!
You must be pretty smart to get a B thinking you did horrible.
heh .. it was ok but kinda boring in a theater
well at least you saw it then.. some people wont even try
I can understand.  Then are times when I want to get out of work too.
Sometimes it is helpful to take a break and go home early.  It allows you to kind of reset.
thats awesome.. how long did that take
yea i can understand that
I hope it's paid too.
Are you going somewhere for a vacation?
I love fossils!
What do you like about them>
What's going on Monday?
Yeah_comma_ I guess that will be like a vacation for you.
why would it be wrong?
ah yea it happens
Oh no! Is it serious?
Well I hope that it isn't serious and your dog makes it through
Congradulations.  I assume it comes with a pay raise.
with a window?
Awesome.  I'm almost a little jealous
what do you mean? did you get stuck somewhere?
lammee_comma_ did you atleast finish up the file?
did you throw him out?
did it work?
That's terrible! I'm really sorry to hear that_comma_ but even if you could have said something it doesn't just make it better.
Is that what happened to her? My mother was like that as well. It's terrible to watch somebody you loved turn into someone else because of an addiction.
That would be annoying. If there is anybody over him_comma_ you might try reporting it first.
Lol _comma_ Maybe you could ask for another department
Man I have recently been getting into shoes_comma_ I dont have nearly as many as some of my buddies_comma_  need to step my game up.
I just like the style_comma_ I want to show off with ever outfit.
Oh hate when that happens.  How did you know you acted a fool
You'll figure it out.  I believe in you
Why?
I hate that. I'm glad you're ok!
We all do stupid stuff as kids.  The important thing is you realize how bad that behavior is now.
I understand regret over previous actions_comma_ but you just got to move forward.
Good for him! The only time I've ever gotten a hole in one in golf is on a video game. 
It's definitly a really hard thing to do. Your friend must be really lucky!
sorry to hear that
i can see that
You and me both.
The powerball drawing is tonight ;)
Car door?
When did that happen?
I just found one in my toilet the other night!
How bad was it?
That's really cool that you have those awesome memories. Do you ever go baack and see your family?
Well I hope you have a good time!
Have you always had this fear of the dark
Is there any specific reason why?
have you ever been there before? I hear it's great!
Save up and sign up for deal alerts on expedia and other sites. It's really amazing how cheap you can get trips nowadays!
Oh wow_comma_ where do you get these pets? from a shelter or off the street?
oh wow_comma_ thats good of you to be able to bring in dogs off the street.
wow thats great_comma_ is that the one you got off the street?
well i wish you good luck on that one!
Oh my god..I would be too! No locks?
Oh...I have locks on all my gates and the companies have to ask for permission. That is terrible! Did you get your dog back?
Have you tried find a away to keep the seperated?
I'm sure that it will get better. Dogs are really smart so if you keep working with her I'm sure she will get it. 
Oh my gosh! It sound like she has a had a rough life. You are great for taking care of her!
I am bad with anxiety too but if you haven't done anything wrong then all you can do is try to have some self confidence and prepare for the worst and HOPE for the best. You never know- you could be getting a raise!
Prepare then and you will feel better- either way it goes you will be prepared- so if it's bad- you will already have known and if it's not- then you will get surprised. Either way it won't rock your world.
Oh man! Well all you can do is prepare early as you just never know! Life isfull of change.
That's pretty awesome.  What breed
That's pretty generous of you to adopt an abused dog_comma_ especially a pregnant one.  That's a lot of responsibility but I love pitbulls too so I would've done the same
Well of course..Like all the drunks and druggies begging for money who won't work on my corner? Most people are poor..and work hard!
Poor people are the hardest workers in america usually..It's corps that have a HUGE pay gap and the CEOs make ridiculous money while the people keeping the companies don't even make a living wage
Oh no. I'm sorry :(
Pets are great but they sure are tragic.
That's good that you were prepared! Puppys can be a handful.
Man that does sound like a handful!
I hear you! Tell me about your family?
Why did you move away from home? That is cool to have a brother in highschool. Highschoolers usually aren't home much anyhow 
Oh my goodness! That would be so hard!!
You the pitbull guy? haha
Gal :)) what did you end up naming the pup?
It's rare to have great parents it seems_comma_ I am glad you have good ones!
I feel the same about my mom! Wonderful! Remember to cherish them daily_comma_ as we never know what can happen and aren't promised tomorrow
Aww_comma_ I hate to hear that. How long have you two been together?
Well_comma_ hopefully when it's all said and done it'll be be worth it. Best of luck with it.
I have never actually had one of those! We don't get very exotic fruits here in the midwest. What do they taste like?
Never had sunflower seeds. I love Pomegranate juice though. Sounds interesting. Do they taste anything like a watermelon_comma_ or more like a raspberry?
I LOVE watermelon...Geez- I could literally sit and eat a whole one by myself. My complexion always looks better after watermelon too
LOL! I know..my sister hates them..but I don't like most veggies :( Rapsberrys are a close second!
Why_comma_ the odds are not in your favor
Ha_comma_ its never bad to try though
so what was plan B?
oh that sounds good.
When is it due out?
Who is your favorite Marvel hero?
That sounds really great and delicious! 
Ohhhhhh yeah that's no good. Still that happens to me all the time so I wouldn't worry too much about it. 
Does anything awesome ever end up happening?
That's whats up
who did they leave and where?
wow thats crazy.
Oh no_comma_ I hate that
Maybe he comes back or you find him
That sounds creepy
I guess ignore it for now
Sounds like a relaxing day.
Is it your day off?
Well that comes in handy.
ah.. take it to the bank to find out
That's really awesome! What are you going to be doing with your time?
Well that's good! A little rest and relaxation is always good!
Whys that?
Excellent
Oh no! Where were you coming from?
Yikes! Did you get home okay? Normally I weave different ways when I think that
I am sure tomorrow will be fine
I am sorry_comma_ I hope tomorrow is different then
That's great that you were so confident. I wish I could be like that.
That's great that you have that kind of personal growth
it made him a ton of money so i think thats all that mattered to him at that point cause i agree it was crap.
that was back then when he was trying to do something great_comma_ the drive isnt there when you have already done it
that was nice of them.
always good to have friends like that
What pet does she have?
Oh wow. Don't think I've ever seen one of those.
i get that. i am in pain every morning and get up and go to work everyday. so it's hard to find sympathy from me
exactly. it really drives me nuts when people feel like they entitled to this or that.
Hmm maybe it's not your time yet...I'm sure you'll get there
I wish you abundant joy_comma_ success health and wealth in all areas of your life.
Awesome. That's a whole lotta pizza slices.
Awesome I hope you enjoy it.  Don't get too fat.
I am so sorry to hear that. Who is taking care of your neighbor?
That's really sad. Not being able to even know what's going on anymore.
I understand! Did you get in trouble?
Good officer for once! That is good to hear!
Oh no! Why was she starved?
Some people should not be in charge of another living being.
Rainy?
Yuck
That's true. What's going on?
Some people are only out for themselves unfortunately.
Oh wow! What does it look like now?
Going to miss who?
thats a nice gift for a cat.

What's been going on in your life?
Bummer.  You still keep in touch with her or what
Nice.  Give the newbie a chance_comma_ I'm sure she'll come around.  What kind of work do you do
That must be frustrating. What are you going to do now?
I'm so sorry that happened. What brand is the HD?
That is nice.
Yes. Why did you bought that many popcorn kernels?
Dang that stinks_comma_ better luck next time.
thats good that you are trying!
Do you know how it happened?
That sucks. I hate people who do stuff like that and don't take responsibility.
That sounds like so much fun -- and like a break you're looking forward to_comma_ yes?
Have you been before? It seems like such a great way to both play and get a workout ;-)
That's very nice of her!
Your brother is a lucky guy!
I am not sure how anyone could like those things
I do not like them either though
That poor dog
That all sounds horrible
Did they just not care?
Sometimes they are tired at the end of their shift. It happens
what are you saving up for?
wow i wish i could be like you :)
Why is he missing and is he home?/
Oh god_comma_ some dogs have to be watched a lot! Watch the shelters and put up flyers everywhere online
Which part
Hm that's pretty useful info right there...you must be quite the handyman/woman_comma_ I would've probably just bought another one lol
I know right? I love the side hustle!
No idea what that means but it sounds good! lol
where do you want to go.
oh wow that sounds cool
what's happening next week?
aren't we talking about the kids going back to school?
I hope the cat likes it
That is great_comma_ I am glad you got it
What happened? Was he honest with you?
Ugh! Did he offer an explanation yet?
I think a lot of parents are!
Were they a handful over the summer?
is there anything that can be done to save it
what does she plan to do if she cant?
It happens a lot
Was it a long wait
thats always nice to have time to sit and relax
good for you.
I am sorry_comma_ any reason why?
I am sorry you are going through that
Some drunks are funny_comma_ and some are unfortunately annoying as hell.
Oh man_comma_ all your friends are the annoying drunks?
You  got lucky.  I don't ever seem to get warnings.
Yeah no kidding. You caught a break.
I am happy that you think your interview was successful.  I know they can be nervewracking sometimes.
I am glad to hear it.  I hope you get the new job!

ah_comma_ i get that. thats good.
Nice what do you do
That's pretty awesome keep grinding
Thats great! You are reaching your goals then?
More information?
That is very sweet. Family is important
I know that feeling for sure
Ah man! You shouldn't feel bad about tripping. Why do you feel bad about it?
Take it in stride. Humility is a great feature to have!
I get like that_comma_ was there a particular reason or just don't like it in general?
That can be scary. We live in the middle of nowhere so I really panic when I hear something. I totally understand
that sounds like fun. what amusement park?
that is awesome. hope you enjoy yourself
I don't have a green thumb myself. What plants are you growing?
Wow. That's quite a variety! Those cantaloupes will be delicious!
Interesting.  You gonna get new ones
What kind were they
Some people don't realize it's just as easy as being comfortable being yourself to be accepted.
Are you gonna have to see this person again?
hrmm_comma_ did it grow legs and walk away?
you probably need to think about setting up a search crew
I think we've all gone through that. How many tickets did you buy?
That's good. Not much wasted then.
That sounds great. Are you going to go get brunch after?
That's usually what I do.
Oh wow_comma_ that is great for her
Its a good thing to be healthy
That is nice_comma_ do you usually go to church? 
Defenitly_comma_ sounds like something that you are your brother can share together and bond!
I have heard that a lot today! How did yours get out
Ah! Have you put up flyers_comma_ etc?
that sounds good.
yea its great when things come together.
Thats awesome_comma_ are you in the wedding?
Well_comma_ atleast you will be happy for him and there.
Oh no! Do you forget birthdays a lot? I do sometimes. Always good to set reminds on your google calender etc
Did you get them a late birthday present/
Saving money is so important
That is very smart to think about
Yea_comma_ you definitely need a break every now and then. Is it vacation time?
Sounds like you're really tired. Are you going to make it to the end of the year without a break?
that is so cool. i loved the old school computers
i know right. and the aol and dial up screeching in the background
I am sure you will get it eventually
I hope you do not have to do that
You are a great friend!
Well_comma_ she's very lucky to have you during this tough time for her.
I can imagine. Luckily mine don't go far when they do
I'm sure it was a challenge getting him back home_comma_ at least you got some exercise haha
Oh no!  Why did it take them so long to get back with you?
That's horrible!  Did you already have plans made for the trip?  I hope you can work it out with them_comma_ but if not maybe finding another job that is a bit more accomodating would be beneficial.
Do you mean the biology class was taken at a school?
Wow. That is pretty amazing. Did you enjoy it?
That is nice. Would you be buying your cake there?
I understand. Is it close to your home?
That's very kind of you. How long has he lost his job?
3 months isn't too bad. I hope he stays strong.
who won?
he'll get them next time.
People usually dread Mondays. What's happening that day?
Oh hahaha. A lot of my friends have been tweeting about that.
Cats are very fun_comma_ sometimes
I am sure its a nice cat too
uh oh_comma_ did something happen?
What usually happens this tiem of year?
I can't wait for it to cool  down. It's so hot here.
Texas.  It was in the 90's today.
Oh man_comma_ that kind of thing would make me furious. Do you have any idea who it might have been?
Yeah_comma_ I hate it. Parents need to start raising their kids better.
I'm sure they aren't though_comma_ hahahaha.
I hope the one who doesn't want to return at least gets to spend more time with their friends.
you should probably go to the doctor
well it might help you get rid of them a little quicker or find the underlying issue
What's your plan?
aw is he usually clingy?
What kind of cake was it
I am glad_comma_ you deserve a treat every once and awhile
That sounds pretty amazing. Is the place you go to nearby?
Oh that's actually not that bad. How long are you guys going for?
I hope you do not get sick!
I guess you were hungru

That's unfortunate_comma_ made a new one since?
That's terrible_comma_ I hope you find someone soon.
so do you wait till you are back at home?
yea thats understandable

have you tried the shelters or local vets?
Being alone is good sometimes!
Yep. You should definitely do the things you wouldn't normally do with people around!
Wow that's a strange thing. Any idea why that happened?
Haha must think you guys are the luckiest on the block.
I am glad_comma_ what grade did you get
Oh wow_comma_ that is great
That sucks. Have you tried contacting your family?
Well_comma_ you're talking to me so that's something.

did you pull over or keep pushing through
well at least you made it safely through!
What grades are they in
Oh wow_comma_ that is a lot of school
do you think its going to happen?
thats good.
I hate that. Work is never fun on the weekends
That sounds very painful
Oh I love trying new things for me! Everyone deserves spoiling sometimes
I have that problem too. Most feel heavy and make me sweat. I really hope it's just right for you
Great! What kind of job and how good of a promotion?
Oh great! Hopefully a nice chunk of change :)
Are you going to get the right part?
I am sure you can find help online
Congrats! What kind of job is it?
Great! What kind of stuff will you be doing?
Its instinctive. They  pretty much know what to do by instinct.
That's great to hear.  I'm glad it worked out.
i don't really follow players when they get so big that they seem like they are getting too big for their britches
i used to live in miami and that was a big deal when he was part of the white hot heat
ah yes its always nice to take a moment to remember the past
thats wonderful to hear! take care.
Why was it without you?
Well that can't be helped. What kind of trip was it?
No_comma_ not if he is being loud and rude_comma_ that is never okay
I guess he has no care for anyone but himself
did he get a beat down?
ah well in that case thats a good move.
What kind of pet was it?
Very cool lizards_comma_ I like their beards.
Oh wow_comma_ I'm sure she will understand! My send some nice flowers and a sorry card.
A mothers love is unconditional_comma_ she will forgive you :)
Just be careful_comma_ I am sure you know what you are doing
I am sure you will be okay
I am glad you go! What kind of church is it?
What are they doing tomorrow?
Why did you have to cancel?
I can understand that - unfortunately some times we have to do those annoying things in order to keep things level.
Were the people involved ok?
Always that bad egg everywhere. It's people like that_comma_ that causes accidents.
yes i cant wait for it to be over!
yea we have the AC on way too much in the summers
What's going on next week?
Oh yea_comma_ how could I forget that. How many kids do you have?
Wow congratulations! Will it be a big ceremony?
That's smart_comma_ I think big weddings are a waste of money honestly.
It's good to have friends you can count on like that.
You're right. They're pretty rare.
Yeah its really hot here. I can't wait for it to cool off.
it was in the 90's today
aw that's so sweet. I hope it goes well.
Is it your first date with the person?
sounds like my wife
i set the clocks ahead in the house and in the car .. it doesnt work all the time but it helps 
Nice. How many tickets did ya get?
Good luck! How'd you choose the numbers?
how do you feel like it went?
that would be amazing. when will you know?
They still have not taken notice?
That's very unfortunate_comma_ hopefully that changes.
What happened to your dog?
I'm sorry to hear that.  are you going to get another doggo?
Wow. Did the roach make it?
Dang. You sure told him!
Congratulations! How did you go about losing so much weight?
Oh I can relate_comma_ I love food a lot and it's a curse and a blessing.
Man_comma_ that sounds really delicious. Where'd you get the recipe?
Your boss sounds pretty amazing. I want to work with you guys_comma_ hahaha.
Oh wow_comma_ that must be confusing_comma_ scary and fustrating!
Exactly! no one is going to take the warnings seriously!
Really? Can you explain that more?
That's amazing. I really am impressed for your dog.
Aww_comma_ that's sad. I have been there more than I like to admit.
I'm sure if he's a good brother he will understand. My family is always happy to receive food as a gift because it's made with love.
wow that is awesome that you were able to do that
everyone needs to get out in the real world to stay sane!
That is sad. What was the gift she wanted?
wow_comma_ she is asking too much. Every kid want a horse.
Good life partners are hard to find. You hold on to him.
How long have you two been together?
oh really how?
haha that is great
ohh_comma_ strange. Keep an eye on him.
Yes. Be safe. Call police in emergency.
Oh no_comma_ what happened next?
I'm glad nothing happened.
wow_comma_ she should be very good?
That is very good.
That's terrible! You are being nice to try and help her.
Hopefully she can find something else quickly so she doesn't worry so much
wow thats a great score!
hard work pays off as they say.
I actually don't know too much about basketball_comma_ so I really don't have a strong opinion on that. Is that a bad thing?
I guess he's confident that he can do well with any team.
That's great! Do you have a traditional job or do you work for yourself?
I know it's hard when you're not sure if you can make enough money. Was there a change that made you feel better about it?
O really? how'd she react to hearing that?
I'm sure something really frustrating happened first.
oh my were they able to take it?
what a fool. where the cops able to catch him?
that stinks. hopefully he won't try it again on you or anyone else for that matter.
me either. i'm sorry you had to go thru that.
Yeah that's annoying.  Welcome to the problems of having an attactive mate.
Take it as a compliment.
Yes it is.  Its unavoidable though. People suck.
I'm so sorry_comma_ it's hard to lose our animals_comma_ they become a part of our family.
The pain never really goes completely away_comma_ but it does get easier to deal with.
ohh_comma_ that's bad. I feel sorry for her
Don't worry. She will recover. I will pray for her
Why? Did he steal it? haha
Oh wow_comma_ that is low! Hate men like that_comma_ that won't support their children.
Well that is very nice of you.  Is it a pretty big project?
That is great.  I sure they are very thankful for the lep
Oh thats scary! 
Im sorry to hear that! Maybe next time it will be better or try another way to travel that is better.
Why was she so late_comma_ thats terrible
I'm so sorry. I hope she makes it up for her.
ohh that's nice. Legos was one of my favorite games_comma_ when I was a kid
Yes_comma_ today's kids! They just stick to their ipad.
I have not - do you enjoy watching him?
He is pretty amazing!
Oh wow that does sound scary! Are you okay? Any damage to your home?
That's good! I know insurance can be a pain to deal with!
Wow. It is so nice of him. I am supprissed that the pick up lasted 12 years.
That is a very solid truck that you have.
Oh no! Did you have any sort of security cameras to see who did it?
That's horrible. I hope you can find a way to recoup what was lost quickly and move on.
Is that a movie?
Oh wow_comma_ that certainly sounds like a sad movie for sure!
Cool. Has it been taking a long time_
I hope to move into a house next year
Ouch_comma_ was it way worse then normal due to weather?
That's scary_comma_ i hate driving in storms.
I bet! Hopefully you can take some time off and go see them soon!
I understand_comma_ I'm sure your family misses you as well. Maybe you can meet half way for the holidays.
My kids just started back Thurs and my new semester starts then too. I definitely understand
I'm sure it'll go fine. Usually the jitters are worse than it actually is
Were they pokay
Oh well_comma_ I am sure they have moved on
ohh good for you. But why is that?
ohh that's cool. I have never been there at such place. But_comma_ I am happy for you.
Why does she do that
That sounds bad_comma_ I feel bad for you
Time sure flies doesn't it - what is it about this time of year that takes you back?
ah yes_comma_ those were the days - the carefree days of summer!  Now we just work - LOL!
I like those as well_comma_ what are some of yours
Oh that sounds so nice
what is 4 for?
it was like monsoon weather here too. it's depressing and my garden is suffering
That must have been an embarsing situation but we've all been there.
haha I'm sure it'll be a good story to tell and hopefully you can laugh about it now.
That's a bummer!  Were you upset about it?
yeah_comma_ I can understand that.  Maybe next time you'll get to go and he'll have to work!
It must be nice to be rich
I am sorry_comma_ just be yourself
O yea? what kind would that be?
Nice_comma_ I love thigns like that_comma_ so important I feel.
That's sad to hear - it's hard to find a true good friend.  How far away are they moving?
Hopefully you will be able to visit and vice versa  - but it's never really the same is it?
I am sorry. I am sure he appreciates you being there for him
Its good he has such good care
Oh yeah_comma_ that was a great feeling to have_comma_ especially as a child.
It's the same with me and my finacee. We'll just go somewhere nice for dinner or something. That childhood magic was the best.
that's awesome. i really want to go camping but we haven't been able to yet
are you going somewhere local or going out of town ?
that is always fun. enjoy your time.
That would be disappointing. What will you do?
That's too bad. Good luck with that.
I bet you are proud of her
Sounds like a smart girl
how sweet. what did they do on their special day?
i get that. i wish we had children so my husband could do that.
In what areas?
I hope that you all meet and exceed your goals.  It's great to have goals to work towards.
That sucks_comma_ did they just study more or what happened?
I would be too. Well maybe you'll get a better grade than him next year
oh that's bad. I feel sorry for you.
But don't feel dejected. Your time will come. I pray for your bright future.
I am sorry_comma_ are you okay
What kind of car
I bet it is so cute! What breed is it?
Oh I love those! Well at least you can go over and play with it anytime you want without having to clean up after it lol
Is there a way you could go and see him?
I'm sorry you won't get to see him this weekend - perhaps you can have a nice long phone call or skype or something to catch up until you can see him again.
That sounds hard
That does sounds sounds to me
You dont like your neighbors?
That is a nice feeling
Cool. I haven't ben to chrch in a while
I should make time to go though
Well congrats! Is it kindergarten?
Mine are in 1st_comma_ 6th_comma_ and 9th grade this year so I know what you mean.

Don't be too hard on yourself.
Does your boss has thought it is you?
Hopefully_comma_ he will forget about it.
i hope that you will get the job that is going to be what is best for you. stay positive.
that is important. like my grandma always tells me "like attracts like" so be what you want to attract to you.
What do you plan on doing with your time off?
Maybe a quick shot to the beach.

I hope you do well
Why not?
That sucks. Maybe you can go next weekend

That's awful he might be in your house.
That's awful. How did it catch on fire?
That sucks.
Do you have home owners insurance?
I'm sure it will all work out.
Did you enjoy it there?
That is hard when you are young.  My family moved around a lot until I was 13.
Good for you! How was your first experience?
I am really happy for you. Hope i'll be a dad one day.
Me too! This heat in Texas is killing me.
Yes_comma_ I have family in Nashville and they said it's been hot!

Ah_comma_ so not just a little town festival - ya'll did it big!!  It sounds amazing!
Your cat must have got treats for that.
That's brutal_comma_ my cat plays with her kills too.
What's your issue?
That's rough_comma_ being an adult has it's perk though!
What do you miss most?
That is the best to be fair_comma_ maybe some day when we grow old we can be ignorant again.
What did he do?
OH no. Does he have a problem?
Well hopefully he will get better
Did you study?
Calculus 1?
Just wait til you get to calc II... that's the miserable one.

That's awesome how old are you today?
Oh no! What happened? Was she upset?
Smart thinking! Cats are always good scapegoats lol

Why do you want them to be babies again?  That sounds like a lot of waking up in the middle of the night.
That will pass. Just give it a little time :)
Oh the memories
What was in there?
What I woluldnt do for my old game boy.
I agree when I hear music from the older generation I be like now this is some real music. 
Way better then this music today I turn the radio off on this wack music today no dancing for me lol.

I have two daughters myself_comma_ so I know where you are coming from.
That sucks. Did she get a better job?
Oh that sucks
Whos that?
Can you reapply?
Thats no good
Find somewhere else they dont deserve you
What did she send you as a gift?
I hope not too_comma_ you'd be better off keeping it.
Does it fit you nicely?
That is amazing hard work pays off and I think it is great that our kids know how to swim.
How old is he that is great my daughter is 5 I think that will be one of my goals for the remainder of the summer teaching her the basics of swimming without her life jacket.

Well_comma_ hang in there. I know it sucks but eventually the right person will come along
You must be lonely because of that.
Where did he fly off too?
That is random_comma_ where does he work?
That's good to have a bunch of people working with you that are fast and good at their job. I bet it makes everyone's job a lot easier.
I remember days like that - they always seem to last forever!
is it gonna feel better _comma_ when they finally start going back to school ?
my little sister is the same way_comma_ these new kids my dad would make me go landscaping with him for my back to school clothes
Do you have to make a presentation
Are you nervous?
well congrats!! hopefully it  was a good raise for everybody
that's so sad and why was that?
Oh_comma_ no!  I hate to hear that.  What type of dog was she?
It is so hard when we have to say goodbye to anyone - even to our loyal friends.  Why did you have to get rid of her?
Well_comma_ I just have to say how sorry I am that you had to let he go.  Maybe you can keep visiting her at least. 
Do you have a night light?
That's such a good idea_comma_ did the scary movies ruin you?
Don't worry_comma_ you'll do great! You're very articulate and confident.
I think you got this. Don't stress it.
There's plenty to talk about with sports_comma_ you'll have enough content to fill up ten minutes!

Aww - I'm glad he surprised you like that!
Oh no! Did you quit too?
Well that's very loyal of you. I'm sure your boss will appreciate it. Maybe you'll get a promotion!
Is she going to start a college? Why is she moving?
I am a bit confused. Was it a transfer from work or what?
That's cool. Was it the newest one?
Good idea
It'll happen to you soon_comma_ your soulmate is out there somewhere.
Hey that might be a good idea! Nobody knows what you like better than you!
how was it?
that makes no sense lol
I always found them good. Why would you prefer the ones in the early 2000s? 
I understand. I remind me when I was kid.
Did you call the police?
That's awful_comma_ I would recommend some posters.
Awesome! What kind of dog did you get?
Awe how cute! Huskies are some of the funniest dogs! They always have the funniest expressions!
Are you prepared?
What kind of math is on the test?
That is weird_comma_ I like calculus a lot.

That's great_comma_ that means you're prepared
Good luck! not like you'll need it :)

How long have you been working with a trainer?
Oh I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ is that far from where you live now?
Yeah_comma_ that really sucks. At least it's easier to keep up with people online these days.
Doesn't surprise me_comma_ they do that to me every single time I go. I'm picky though so my order is always complicated.
I hate onions too_comma_ even if I pick them off I can still taste them on the burger. So gross.
I bet it's beautiful! Did she wear it often?
You're so lucky to have that to remember her by
Hmm_comma_ how do you feel about that? 
Lol! Well I'm sure that's not the case! It's cliche for sure but the right person really comes along when you're not expecting it a lot of the time!
Well you must have really liked that pizza!!

Did they move permanently?
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. At least now you have a reason to travel
Oh awesome! What kind of puppy are you getting?
Huskies are the best breed! They're so derpy and cute!
My favorites are huskies and big slobbery St Bernards. They give the best hugs and cuddles.

I hate being a grown up_comma_ I wish I could go back to the good old days.
Oh wow_comma_ that sounds pretty terrifying!
Jesus_comma_ that's a lot. Keep your doors locked and a chainsaw handy. Hopefully he's caught soon.
Are you doing anything special for it?
You could always throw yourself a party. That way you can invite who you want_comma_ and avoid seeing people you don't want. Haha
Oh no! I hope you were wearing clean full coverage underwear that day!
You couldn't tie a sweater around your waist?
wow!! that was really good congrats!! your hard work paid off

Yep_comma_ good lecturers always help when you're learning.
Oh no! Two weeks is a bit long. Works sucks sometimes_comma_ huh?
Make sure to keep in touch!
Weather can really be fickle.  Did you have a back-up plan?
That's not a bad way to spend your day.  That can be just as fun if you get the right kind of movies.  
That's impressive!
That's still an impressive accomplishment! If they didn't buy it_comma_ that just means you get to take it down by yourself again!
Oh really? Was it pretty exciting then?
That sounds like fun. I think you definitely got your money's worth.
Oh no! Is it close to your house?
Well make sure you stay inside and lock your doors and windows and don't answer your door!
Congrats! That's great!
That is quite an accomplishment and you should be proud!
Are you happy or sad about it? I mean on one hand you have all that time to yourself but at the same time I'm sure you miss them.
I know what you mean_comma_ I feel that way every time my kids go to their grandparents house too.
That sounds like a classic car. Did you used to ride in it with your dad a lot?
Haha that's awesome! Sounds like you had a fun time with it!
Ugh they do that at my apartment too. You should put a can outside with a big sign that says "THROW YOUR NASTY BUTTS HERE"
I know_comma_ it's like it's not that hard to just put them in an ash tray or put it out and throw it in a trash can.
Oh no! Was it damaged?
That's such a relief! Did it clean up easily?
Did you mean cat?
Well sometimes cats like to roam around. I hope he comes back soon. I love cats
Wow! Congrats! I know you were happy about that!

Wow! That is kind of messed up!

Just cherish her being little all you can. I wish mine were still little like her. 
Yum! Pizza is the best
Oh noooo! That should be illegal!
You must really trust your son. That's wonderful that your son is responsible enough that you can trust him with your debit card.
That's so rare in teenagers! Sounds like you did a great job raising him.
I know what you mean. It's really hard to quit. How long have you been smoking?
Yes you can! Just get some hard candy to keep your mouth busy. That helped me the one time I was able to quit.

That's quite interesting.  I need to learn more about cryptocurrency.  I thought that I had missed the opportunity.
I've always wondered if cryptocurrency is as confusing as investing in stocks.  Cryptocurrency reminds me of the Dot.Com frenzy.
Cool. What grade?
I have one in pre-k and an 8th grader now. Makes me feel so old
Were you on good terms?
Wow with a kid involved that's a big no no! I'm sorry you're going through this

I knew it. Did you receive any apprehension for your irresponsibility from management side?
Who is tom?

Sorry to hear that. Is there any specific reason for your decision?
Does he treat differently now than it was before? If it is still the same_comma_ then why breaking his heart?
I'm sorry! I'm sure something better will come along.
Always be positive :)
Thats lame_comma_ why is work alwasy keeping us from doing what we love.
yes exactly_comma_ in foreign countries they have sometimes mandatory vacation time!

Thats a lot of siblings

MY sister doesn't even say bless you if I sneeze lol
Good. Why do you follow diet?
Hope you you can do this time. 
I don't follow

Now you have learned a valuable lesson and know how she really feels toward you
That was harsh lol
I hope you meet somebody then
How is she sneaky?
WHy did she do that?

school can be hard on anyone _comma_ especially socialiazing with other students 
I dont like scary movies
i do like halloween though
I don't keep up with that stuff
I know. I shold do better
Why did you break up with your partner 2 years ago?
Don't be so pessimistic. I am single too_comma_ but i did not lose my hope. There is always someone who will be interested in you
That's great that unemployment is down.
I'm ashamed to say I don't really follow politics too closely.
That would be great for you!

Thank you! I am sure you are going to find right one too_comma_ good luck 
I do too. Wat do you like?

What is your favorite super hero movie?
To be honest_comma_ it seemed quite childish for me
That sounds so frustrating! I can't stand messy people.
Sounds like it! Are you in a management position or something where you can say something to them?
Sounds like a handful!
That's exciting! First day of school can be stressful.
Oh no did you research what happened for it to be like that?
I believe you will do better next semester_comma_ cheer up buddy
That's great! I don't like being alone all the time really.
Oh that's horrible. Yes_comma_ you have overcome a lot it sounds like! Your outlook seems great now.
No I did not
Yes_comma_ I have one credit card 
What color is your favorite dress?
That sounds very nice_comma_ so glad you have that dress.
That is sad. Maybe you should put more effort in teaching her yourself
Yeah that will help a lot.  however do not blame yourself very much.It ain't entirely your fault
Swimming is really fun and besides it_comma_ it is very healthy as it involves all muscles of the body to be engaged in movement
Good idea. That way she will learn self-discipline and flexibility
That's great! Did you enjoy it?
That's awesome. Sounds like you have a great set of friends.
Wow. Well done! How did you do it?
That's a good spot then
Must be nice_comma_ planning anything exciting?
Thats fair_comma_ so long as you destress and have a good day it doesn't matter what you do right?
But you know_comma_ if you have some time off might be a good chance to do cleaning 'round the house too.
'eh_comma_ you can never have to much time to get caught up don't you think?
Oh really? Any reason why not?
Well I am sure you did the best you could with it. 
you should thrash in the waste bin
oh ok_comma_ that good you took safety precaution and others from getting harm by doing that_comma_ welldone
Sorry - I'm not sure what you are talking about. What was?
Ah right - what did you do then?
All's well that ends well then

Well that's good. I can imagine that would have been frightening]
don't be too anxious_comma_ i trust your team will win
haha_comma_ i finally meet someone who is like me_comma_ game on buddy
That's a good way to be. No point in being envious all the time.
Me too - it would stop so much hate and bitterness.
Same here! I haven't picked one up yet_comma_ but I loved all the choices they made on it. Some true gems on there.
Right! I had only played the leaked beta from back in the day. That's the one I am most excited about!

I have always wanted a corgi. They're very cute dogs. How old is he?
Holy heck_comma_ just like right out of the parking lot or what?
Crap is your insurance going to be able to get you another car or what?
Have you thought about getting a second opinion?
Perhaps you should get different insurance.
that's so sad
All it takes is just a smile and a hello and at least you have one now. Me!
What did she do to fail you?
Did she have the baby?
May be because of the talent they possess!!
Valid point_comma_ Opportunity and skill sets are different 
Really? Business or pleasure?

That's awesome! She sounds very nice then.
It's so nice to find someone that caring and kind! 
wow interesting
i am sure you wont miss it
I absolutely hate liars.   Are you sure he is really a friend if he lied to you?
Oh_comma_ I see.   I guess its kinda hard to give a friend you have a long time over a lie they told.   Hopefully he/she had a good reason to tell the lie then.
What is the interview for?
That sounds like a great job.
Wow! When do you go?
Not too long to wait then. Are you going to Tokyo?
Really? What did they do?

You should be arrested for this.
You can report yourself to the police.
Really? Why?
I'm not sure everyone agrees. But I'm not American so I can't judge it fairly
If you are very sure about it. I know you will!!
Good for you. I hope you will
Were you expecting them to?
Do you expect them to lose now?
Have you ever thought of talking to someone online?
Perhaps you should join Facebook.
How much have you still got to go?
I'm sure you'll be fine
Me too. He was a cool guy.
Yeah it's very sad
What did you receive?
What was in it?
When does it come out?
I'm looking forward to it too
What kind of donuts?
Did you eat them quickly?
I haven't watched it in years. Is it good this time?
That always makes it interesting
Was anyone there or was it just the wind?
At least it wasn't a robber.
Oh really? I didn't know that actually
last time I saw him_comma_ he was playing pretty rough so it's neat to hear he's back on track
That is great_comma_ I bet it is pretty.
Do you play any instruments?
CAn you not ask him not to?
Could you hide the keys?
Is it for a job?
What kind of job is it for?
You will do fine_comma_ just relax.
Just remember that it is only one interview. 
No - did you used to text while driving?
But maybe some people aren't as consientous as you and did get into accidents
was there something wrong with it?
ah well thats true
Are they going to pay for the repair?
That stinks_comma_ nothing you can do.
Top scorers in what?
Nice_comma_ what is your favorite subject?

ok now deal with it by confessing to her 
oh ok. Just be hopeful that he won't find out
What are you looking to get?
Have you asked you boss?
Aww_comma_ you must have been close to them.
That's hard to lose someone so close to you. At least their memory will live on forever with you.
Maybe he wants you to work the weekend.
That would be a smart move.
I do not like pizza.
I just do not like the sauce and too much bread.
Why not?
It's not fair - but I suppose the opposite view is that if they make enough money then you don't need the support that otehr people do.
What happened? Was it that bad?
I am sure she didn't like that.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Do you think there are any reasons for that?
Who is everyone?
How many grandchildren do you have?

I hope it works out well for you buddy

Did the dog ever come back?

What job is it for?
What is the name of the charity?
Did you shave it off or are you naturally bald?
Have you considered a hair transplant?
What did she make?
Nice. I love creamy pasta sauces
I know right? The wage gap is pretty big in many cases.
That's a good way of looking at it. It really boggles the mind.
I agree. I'm sure Lakers fans are thrilled!
I don't think they can... yet. But I'm rooting for them anyway.

well at least it brought back some good memories!
oh wow that is gross.

Oh man! What did you want to do with it?
I love to fish. There'll be other chances though
did they taste good?
thats all that matters!
Why did you do that?
lol. Did the child cry when you took it?
What did he do?
That sounds very interesting.
Job interviews always make me nervous. Research is a great idea!
It definitely can't hurt. Good luck on the interview!
Lovely- how old is he?
I heard about a baby who's first words were "Hey_comma_ Google"
Yeah - along with a  million kids called Alexa.
Wow. What did you do then?

I'm glad you got your money back.
Then all is well!
Are you going on vacation?

That can be exciting. Are you nervous?
Have you prepared for any questions that they may ask?

Well done. What are you going to do with it?
During the day?!!?
I love the park! What are you going to do there?

I hope it goes better next time.
i bet those tasted mighty good!

Oh_comma_ I love soccer!
I like Manchester City!
I am so envious of you.
What will you do with your free time?
Woah! Really?? That's weird.
Maybe it tastes amazing though - we'll never know. They put vinegar on ice cream in italy sometimes.
and... im guessing they didnt.
wow you dont see that everyday. thats a good friend to have by your side
Did it go as well as you had hoped?
That's great news. Your confidence paid off.
What kind of job?
I wish you the best of luck!
Well done! What are you going to spend it on?
Free pizza tastes good.

Was it a bad area?
Did anything happen or did you get home safely?

You can always have a salad today.

Oh no. Shouldn't you go and look for him?
That must have been annoying.
I hope everything is okay now.
That was nice of them. Were you surprised?
It has to make you feel good to know that they care so much.
Is it because of the shootings?

How smart?
Well done!

I'm sorry to hear that. What did you do about it?
That always makes me fee better. 
You must be a nice sibling.
Was it a komodo dragon?
how long does that take to make
ah i figured it would take longer
I cannot even imagine how horrible that must have been. What did you do?
LOL....I think I would have still been showering.
That doesn't sound fair.
I'm glad you didn't get a ticket.
Not really - other than close family - you?
Good - does she feel the same way?
Do you have any big plans? OR just a day of relaxation and recovery for this coming week?
Ah. I'm jealous- Maybe you should go for a walk or something and get fresh air too.
Pizza is my favorite food.   WHat toppings did you use?
That sounds so delicious.  If I had known you made a pizza I would definitely be over at your house for dinner.
That is always best if you are really hoping to get the job.  Did you get it?

Where do you get them?
oh nice_comma_ are you ready for it?
oh that sounds like a good plan. goodluck
What did you do to get it?
Well done then. When do you start?
I hope it all goes well.
Really? That is much
No don't be ashamed. Some times I eat more than 5 when am really hungry.
You are welcome
Why do you think you didn't get the job?
Maybe you should try and get experience in those areas to help you in the future then?
Did you get it?
haha I know the feeling. Is it in the job field that you would want?
That is such a relaxing fun thing to do. Are you going to see something that you've been wanting to watch?
Luckily they have several options. I'm sure you will find one that will be worth seeing.
Oh that sounds scary!
I could only imagine!
was it your first time making it or are you a pro
oh is that something thats easy to make?
What are you going to do with it?
Are you getting anything in particular?

That is true. I wonder if things will be like those day
Oh_comma_ no. I hope for nothing to bad.
Court is scary I have gone before. Do you have to pay a fine?
Why? What happened?
That sounds like a really bad friend.
Any ideas why?  What were you trying to make?
I'm sorry it didn't come out well for you.
You sound excited. I can't wait for the College season to start.
I hope it's a good year for our favorite teams.
Were your suspicions correct?
That sounds amazing! Where was it?
What was the weather like?
Oh wow_comma_ did anyone get hurt?
Yuck_comma_ that sounds really gross.
Did you ask him why he did it?
That sounds so sweet!
He must be a great guy!
What kind of job are you looking for?
Have you applied anywhere?
Really what was it?
That was kind of herr
Were you not expecting the new house ?
Don't you find it more better building your own house?
Why did you feel that way?
I'm sorry you didn't have an umbrella.
That is true
I missed those days too
Yes I certainly have.  I know exactly what you are talking about.
Thats exactly what I was thinking about when you asked me this question.  I had the same thing happen.
Oh wow. I hope it's not going to do any damage!
I hope you're prepared for it.
Oh_comma_ what was it?
That is my favorite video game!
No_comma_ I don't have children. Do you?
Yeah_comma_ it is weird. Your son must be really talented.
From your house?
Why wouldn't he just go to the store and buy his own?
Oh my gosh_comma_ that crazy!  I have not eaten there since I was young and lived in Texas.  I dont think we have whataburger in missouri.
What a coincidence.  I am from texas.   Soon as you said whataburger it brought back memories.  Im glad you were happy with your food!!!
Oh no! What happened?
That's a bummer. It happens to the best of us though!
College is so much fun_comma_ you will love it!
I wish you the best of luck!
Ew! That must have been so disgusting!
It must have tasted even worse. 
That sounds terrifying! How fast were you travelling? How old was the car? What happened? 
Was it an old car? Were the brakes somewhat worn? Or was it an out of the blue brake failure!? That has to be one the scariest things_comma_ I'm glad you managed to use the emergency brake and stay safe!
4 years in October
Mine cheated on me too. We're separated now.
Were you? That must have impressed you a lot.
I agree_comma_ we should strive to be like that person.
I know how that could be_comma_ an old trip down memory lane can make you reflect on so much. 
That is wonderful.  I think that I will take a look at a few of my photo albums and get that feeling too. 
was it a nice surprise?
I'm pleased for you. Did you go on it?
do you feel like you are ready to drive in real time?
I'm glad you passed though!
What do you have to make it for? Are you looking forward to it?
That's a bummer. Hopefully you can find some enjoyment in it. 
That's so funny! How did they react when you did that?
I would've been so embarrassed if that was me. At least you've got a funny story to tell people.
I feel sorry for you_comma_ how did you reacted ?
This is normal_comma_ maybe you should take so time alone to think about how you really fell about the situation. Anger  can make you do things that you will regret later. 
Oh that sound like a lot of fun!! Hope your date ended up being worth all that work.
Confidence is definitely a good things to have when going on a date.   I bet your looked great!
That's good. Great teachers are always needed in this world.
Oh no! Did you hurt yourself bad?
Ugh! Sounds like a problem. Can you find out who it was.
Well its best not to think about it too much. Being angry will not help at all. 
That is so nice of them!
You have some great people at work!
Oh that can be annoying! I guess in her defence it was a Saturday night? But still_comma_ it doesn't take much effort to try to keep the noise down even if you do get in late! I hope you were able to sleep okay. 
Yeah_comma_ like you suggest_comma_ it is the little considerations of the other person's needs that can make the difference between an okay and a really good flatmate.
That is so sad.
Yeah_comma_ it will take some for the pain to go away.
Oh no. I'm so sorry to hear that. It must have been terrifying?
I'm glad you're ok
I hope you did well.  Was it difficult?
What was the test over?
Nice_comma_ who did may I ask?
I see_comma_ you must me so proud of him.
That is cool
Old memories
Awesome! Congratulations to you both! 
I bet. What school is she going to?
Yes I have 3 children
That is so cute! That must make you proud
How did it go? Did you get the job.
Thats so awesome! Was it in the field you wanted?
I bet so.  I can't imagine the difficulty of having to enter a field like that.
Division 1 is pretty prestigious.  That is very cool_comma_ indeed.
Wow_comma_ that must've been awful! How did it all turn out?
That sounds really scary_comma_ I'm so glad it all turned out fine.
It is so nice to have family be able to back you up in a time of need. Have you been able to catch up yet?
That is wonderful! Great wait to start the upcoming holiday season.
Not cool! Why did you do that?
As you should! You should put back the money that you stole.
Why did you do that?
True_comma_ I hope you can fight those urges.
That must be so frustrating
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope he stops soon.
Oh my_comma_ how did you deal with it? I hope you didnt kill it.
Good on you. The spider is probably thankful for that. It didnt mean to scare you.
I am so sorry that you couldnt go as I can see this was so important to you.  Why did you have to cancel?  Must have been something important come up!
Im sorry you that happend to you.  DO you write books?
Was your name on it?
Have you had issues with this worker before?
Oh no_comma_ what did it say?
Oh congratulations!  I am so happy for you!
Were you guys married?
Are you serious? That's so childish. I wouldn't let it bother you even though I know thats easier said than done.
Good on you for taking that stand! You must be very proud of yourself 
Its all down to hard work. You deserve to be there. 
I don't really follow soccer_comma_ but it always cool for an underdog to do well.
I do_comma_ too.  Was it their first time to the final?
That is so cool!
He must be a hard worker!
Do you feel nostalgic about it? If they were good memories.
Yep_comma_ childhood was the best time. Its best to remember these things every now and then.
Oh_comma_ no I"m sorry to hear that. 
I would have done the same thing. Some people have no respect.
Yep those are the most exciting times of life. 
It must have been the best feeling in the world. I am glad you felt it too.
That's great. Is it very nice? I've never been in one of those before. 
How many people does it hold? I have five kids so we have a minivan. 
She must have a lovely voice!
You must be a great parent!
Did you have your alarm on
Oh wow_comma_ I would have thought maybe an animal had gotten in
Yes one time. I was feeling very hopeful that day. Have you?
Oh my_comma_ sorry to hear that. I am sure there is another job out there for you.
How long were you deployed for. And thank you for your service.
In the medical clinic I bet quiet nights were ok.
Oh my goodness_comma_ I'm sorry! I have a dog and two cats.
That says a lot about your spouse_comma_ when losing your pet is worse. 
Cool!  Getting a new phone is like Christma!
That is a pretty good girlfriend to buy you a new phone.
Oh that's nice of them!  I hope you had a good time at the party!
Ooo wine_comma_ a classy bunch of folk you are!
I seem you must be quite proud of her for writing on such a subject.
I agree_comma_ high quality work deserves to be read by a broader audience. 
I sure hope so. Why do you think that it will be a good day?
Yep_comma_ it sounds like you are starting your day off on the right foot.  Hope mine goes as well as yours seems to be going so far.
You must have been so impressed. They must have been quite talented.
I wish I could dance like that! Too bad I am only good with computers!
Oh that sounds awful! What did you do?
At least once it's over_comma_ it's over. I would consider other airlines next time! I would also write a complaint letter. 
Are you good at doing flatpack DIY?
Cool
That must have been exciting. 
I am very happy for you.
I have. It's definitely awful. It's much like losing a family member.
Oh no! What a horrible thing to happen. I'm sorry to hear that.
Wow_comma_ what a good moment you had. What did you take as your meal?
Hahaha hahaha_comma_ u can see that you like good things. I missed that with you.
Are you excited about something?
You must be very hungry
Why would you do that?
Oh wow_comma_ Have you ever thought about getting help?
Yes and it was the worst experience of my life. Have you?
Oh my_comma_ I hope you dont feel scared living alone
Oh_comma_ what is the race? Sounds like a lot of work!
I'm sure all the work will be worth it in the end!
Cool! What style of music? 
Ah I've heard of them_comma_ they used to be played on some of the local rock stations. Love a tour t-shirt_comma_ always means you might make a friend if you wear it out as other fans are bound to compliment you!
Ha. Was it geice?
How much did you save?
Yes_comma_ it is terrifying!
Oh thank goodness it was nothing serious.
That's frustrating. How on earth do you ever get something done?
It would make sense. If you two are doing the same work job_comma_ it's only fair that you evenly divide the housework as well.
What type of work do you do?
Yes_comma_ it's like that all the time for me. 
That is great. I stress myself out over things and I think by doing that it makes things worse.
That is very true. Congratulations on passing your test.
Oh_comma_ goodness. Why did you do such a thing?
Maybe next time ask her. I hope you pay her back when you can.
Excatly! I would love to know what they spend it all on
Yup_comma_ they cheat the system and then get a huge refund back
That is terrible. Are you going to take of her?
Why not asking her to move to your home?
Wow_comma_ that sounds intense. What were some of the features it had?
That does sound scary! I hope you at least enjoyed it a little! 
Yes cruises are awesome. I am sure you will enjoy it.
Nice_comma_ hopefully you many good writers and keep in touch with them!
you must be excited! 
Nice. Im sure you will have lots of fun doing it.
Do you still talk to the people you went with.
Where did you guys hike? Did you stay over night
Yeah I guess that happens every once in a while.  Something you went through recently?
Oh that's too bad.  I'm assuming you didn't win?
Not particularly. I wasn't my best self at that time. I suppose who really is_comma_ though.
At least you had a good experience. I definitely feel you on the responsibilities part!
You must be really excited for it.
I agree_comma_ there are great ways to buy unique things 
That was nice of them to chip in. It must have felt good that you had someone to help. 
That's wonderful. It makes all the difference to have people you can trust_comma_ especially when you are not feeling well. 
That is nice. Do you like fishing?
I am not a big fan but I go fishing once or twice a year.
That's great. How big is the bonus going to be?
That would help me out quite a bit too!
oh no! Is everything ok? I hope he didnt scare you
Im sure your very worried. Please get help and call the police. I know it can be nervewrecking.
That sounds so good and the perfect way to spend a Sunday.
Are you going to a restaurant or making it yourself?
Yes_comma_ I loved him. Have you?
It must have been very devastating. But remember him for all the good times.
DId you get tickets? Or getting ready for your licease?
That's awesome! Good luck I'm sure you will do great.
Hopefully it brought back good ones. Were you close to them?
It's good you have those great memories_comma_ though!
No_comma_ do you have one really sick pet?
Did you toke her to a vet?
Are you serious? Why wouldn't you pay him back.
Oh wow_comma_ I would have called the police.
Did he do something bad?
It's a tough situation. Did you call him after?
That must have been quite the surprise. 
That is so crazy!
That sounds like a smelly situation.
I hope you get that cleaned up.
Was he a competition eater?
That's pretty impressive.  I don't think I could manage that._comma_
Oh man! you must be sad. have you been bad lately?
I can see how your frustrated. Maybe you can talk to your dad about it. 
A workout program?
I'm a division 1 strength coach.
Its good to feel good about yourself
Its a very confident attitude
No unfortunately. Have you?
I agree_comma_ but I also enjoy my independence. 
Football_comma_ soccer or American football
Do you play on a professional team?
Oh no! Hopefully you're able to get it all fixed up so you can use it again.
That's quite a bummer!
You must be excited. packing can be hectic. thank god you are organized. 
I agree. You should double check everything to make sure its there. It will help with the worry and anxiousness about it. 
And what was this thing?
I see_comma_ you must be very prepared and talented to compete in such a thing.
Oh wow! Congrats_comma_ I know the process my husband did one. What is your on?
Yes! What univerisyt it it form
I'm sorry to hear that. Is it a total loss?
Are you going to replace it with a similar year/model?
Oh my_comma_ why can't they just set a time and commit to it?
I agree_comma_ you should talk to your friend to be more committed to the plans.
Well that sucks but at least it seems like you have a decent support system?
Yeah make sure he knows that!
Did everything went as planned?
I understand. Did you planned it another time?
Wow thats amazing. You must be excited and full of joy!
I can agree how you can feel amazed about. Maybe I will get one so I can be amused just like you. 
That's awful. It's a shame that there's still racist people in 2018!
I would have done the same thing.
Yes_comma_ I litke that too. Do you do that frequently?
I understand.
That is awful! You should file a complaint!
I would see if you can escalate it. Talk to the corporate level. 
That sucks. I hope you won't be out of transportation
I bet! They're really cool cars with personality
Oh those definitely sound like some good memories! At least you have some pictures.
I'm sure they would enjoy that quite a bit. They can make memories just like you did.
I do like them but I haven't been on that many_comma_ unfortunately.
Oh no are you alright?
Well_comma_ just never go back to that bar and make all new friends!
Glad to hear you're feeling better again.  How did you hurt it?
That sucks.  Maybe you need to be a bit more careful until its fully healed.
I feel for you_comma_but dont take it the hard way_comma_its well
Thats what you should do
I am sorry you have had back luck. There are some honest people out there. 
I know_comma_ it is true. You just have to try to focus on the good_comma_ I suppose. 
That is a really exciting time. You must be so proud.
I know it's hard when they first go off for college_comma_ but it sounds like you raised her well.
Oh that's amazing! Is it a novel? 
How long did it take to write? I always admire the stamina of people who can write a book. 
Oh I'm sorry. I hope you weren't hurt!
That's okay. It happens to everyone! 
I know it's a blow_comma_ but you're only human. Everybody makes mistakes sometimes.
I'm sorry. People can be greedy and unempathetic.
I'm very happy for you_comma_ thank God you could get a job_comma_ that's good!
I imagine it was very complicated for you when you did not have a job_comma_ that happened to me once and I felt very distressed.
That is nice. How many brothers and sisters do you have?
Nice.
Sounds like a real example of learning from the past. sorry you had to go through that. are you better now?
Sounds like youre in a good place. Congratulations!
That's so funny_comma_ I was just looking at the racing schedule yesterday! I love races- if you are talking about horse races. And good memories are the best. 
Did they used to take you? They can be so exciting. 
That's great! That is wonderful luck!
That is wonderful. I hope you have a great time!
So you definitely believe in the old adage: fail to prepare and you prepare to fail?
That sounds like a very sensible philosophy. 
That is so nice of them! What did they bring you?
It sounds delicious! What a good friend. 
That sounds like fun. Did you see any lions?
What else do you see besides lioins?
Oh my! You must have been terrified about it! Did you get it fixed?
Im sure it was very scary for you. Your such a brave person with alot of courage to do so. 
Wow! That is a very expensive car! Did they win the lottery or something?
Yeah. Must be a smooth ride. Lucky guy!
That's not good.  Can't you withhold if they refuse to fix the leak?  I would be really mad! 
That is true about the waste.  I would sue for compensation.  I think the law is on your side regarding this issue.
That is great.  That is a big worry off your shoulders I'm sure.  
I am glad to hear it.  It is a lot more productive to focus on the future than the past.
That is great. They noticed you because you are doing a good job_comma_
Good luck with that.
who felt left out? I'm confued?
That's unfortunate_comma_ what did she end up doing?
What did u do with it afterwards?
Ok_comma_thats a lot better
Oh that's not fun! I hope it cleared when you took it out! 
It should have cleared it. I once left bread for two weeks when I went home for winter vacation.
That's so cool!  You must be proud.  I'm terrible at hula hooping
It takes a lot more skill than it appears to!
Wow_comma_ congratulations! Are you nervous?
Awesome! I hope it goes smoothly and that everything works out great for you!
That's not right! You could probably complain anonymously to the city. 
No. There's definitely something wrong if they won't call a pest control company.
That is nice. How many childrens do you have now?
Congratulations.
That is great. Good job.
Nice.
That sounds frustrating_comma_ especially if they are inconsiderate and drain you of your funds. They sound kind of entitled.
Oh wow_comma_ that must be embarrassing to deal with. Sounds like they are going through a financial situation_comma_ but they should at least talk to you about it since you two are friends.
That's great! I hope you have lots of fun and don't get too bitten by mosquitoes
Don't forget marshmallows!
Wow.  That was uncalled for.  I am sorry to hear about that.  Sounds like she is not someone you would want to date anyway
Do not let it get you down.  There are plenty of people out there who are jerks.
That is terrible. How much did it cost you to fix it?
I understand. Does the grocery store have outside some camera?
Oh NO! It can be annoying especially early mornings at work with no coffee. Hope you stay away!
Sounds frusterating. I hope your next one is more dependable. 
That's not good! I'm assuming they got it back on for you?
I bet it was! That's pretty quick for them to get the power back on actually. In my city it would take a full day.
I be you cant wait! Seeing exotic animals is so exciting!
This will be fun! I bet your full of joy right now!
Im excited for you! Enjoy your day!
That is so scary! Did they catch him?
I'm pleased to hear that_comma_ the security guard sounds brave. Still_comma_ it must have been very stressful!
That sounds awful! Did they fix the order?
I don't think I would ever order from that place again!
Yikes_comma_ I would've been freaking out.  How did you handle it?
haha I would have run too!
That's so nice... almost a decade!
Very happy for you! To many more!
Awesome first date! Hopefully it goes well for you.
What's your favorite exhibit at the zoo?
Oh my.  I bet you were a nervous wreck.  How did you find your cat?
I am glad he is back home and safe again.  You must be relieved.  
That's awful! Especially in the middle of summer!
Were you able to afford it?
that's amazing 
I wish I can win like you_comma_ I have never won anything before
You have to give your spot to someone else? What do you mean exactly?
That's unfortunate but_comma_ an emergency is an emergency.
That is great!  Are you nervous about whether or not you will get into med school?
That's good to know!  I would be super excited if I were you!
That's frustrating!  We have cat scratching posts EVERYWHERE to try to avoid that_comma_ but still had to put the sticky tape on the couch to prevent scratching
Cats are always getting into things they shouldn't_comma_ but I still love them
What did you do there?
That sounds like a lot of fun! I have never been there
Awesome_comma_ I love breakfast! What did you have?
Ah_comma_ such a classic breakfast! You can't really go wrong with that.
You must be proud.  Did her team win the game?
Impressive.   Is she looking forward to her next game? 
That is the worst!  Did you have somewhere you needed to be?
That stinks!  Hopefully you are not to mad because of it.  Flat tires happen to the best of us!
That's awesome! It's always good to catch up with an old buddy.
Hopefully he hasn't changed too much and you guys still have similar interests!
That sounds wonderful! I'm sure you
I am sure you will get there_comma_ I meant to say. Don't rush or settle and I am sure you will find something perfect. We bought our first house on Friday!
Great! What was it about?
Oh how cool! Did you go alone or with your family?
Oh no! I am sorry to hear that. 
Oh dear. Well next time you are at the store_comma_ get two cartons!
its always good to be prepared. I live in an area that gets hurricanes too.  I've even got a generator. 
Last hurricane I was without power for a whole month. It was miserable. 
Oh no! I have had that happen too! It was very embarrassing!
Yes! Did you notice after a short time?
Oh_comma_ I'm sorry you had that experience. When I was traveling cross-country_comma_ I used to FaceTime or Skype friends and family. Would that work for you?
That's very true. Another thing I did was find a Trader Joe's or some sort of store and stock up on decent food. Eating alone's no fun_comma_ but at least you're safe and nourished!
I would be so scared to sky dive! How nervous were you before the jump?
I'm glad you didn't pass out! I don't know if I would be able to go through with it.
Congratulations on that. What are her plans now?
I hope she would find one as it seems now the economy is really competitive
That's very sad.  Are you planning on going to syria to help them?
It could end today if everyone came to an agreement.
You must have prepared yourself for this! You will do great!
Great preparation indeed! 
That must have been scary! How are you feeling?
I wouldn't want to be either that sounds terrifying!
That is great.  Was it a scratcher ticket?
I bet.  That was a great surprise I am sure.  Enjoy your vacation!
How frusterating! Have you brought it up to management
I can tell the frusteration in your tone. I would go above your supervisor since nothing has been done. Otherwise you will stay frustrated and angry. 
Wow! I dont know what else you can do. Your at a dead end right now. How annoying!
I know how you feel. I would be furuious. 
Are you nervous?
I do too! I'm always worried I'm going to throw up!
I hate when parents don't keep tabs on their kids_comma_ especially when they are misbehaving!  What did you do?
At least you did the right thing and didn't yell at the kid yourself.
I wish you the best of luck! 
There are many types of loans out there_comma_ so hopefully you get one! It will also help you build your credit. 
I bet your anxious to know what happens
Wow! I bet you were so happy for her. I can tell by the joy in your words
Who says unreal things? 
Yes that happens but_comma_ I'm not really understanding the context of your comment...
Relaxation is very needful
Yes_comma_its well deserved_comma_very wrlcomed
Yeah its very nervwrecking. Im anxious as well to know how it turns out. 
Yeah makes me nervous to know what and how it will turn out. Hopefully everything will turn out good for the best. 
That must have taken some preparation! How did you feel afterwards?
I wouldn't be able to move the next day! I hope you rewarded yourself after all of that hard work!
An ID for glue? What's next_comma_ showing ID for buying a greeting card? Sheesh.
I can see that. I guess this is why we can't have nice things.
Know the feeling. I had one job where I spent all day either playing cards or working online_comma_ just to relieve the boredom!
Is there any way you can do something else during down time_comma_ or do you have to be available immediately if it gets busy?
I'm sorry. What type of job do you do?
Me too. My phone was a help to play online games if I was totally losing it! And sneaking out for a walk helped too!
WHOA! That's awesome! I've never won anything in my life lol
I bet! What did you do with all the money?
Oh no!  Did you ever find him again?
I am sorry to hear that.  Maybe he will find his way back home some day.
Why did you lose contact? What happened?
That's very sad_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that
Why alone
So where did you sped the time alone?
That sounds like fun Who are you going with?
I am sure you will enjoy it. 
Oh that sounds like fun! What types of food do you cook?
Food always makes the party! 
Wow! How content you must feel about it!
That must have made you feel happy! I can tell!
I'm so sorry to hear that. Losing family can be_comma_ and is_comma_ very tough.
That's all you really can do. I hope you find that you heal in time.
The irony that the internet bill could not be paid online is kind of funny.  But I can see how that would be a let down and inconvenient.
That is good.  I like to pay most of my bills online too
Whew_comma_ you're braver than I am.
I hope it all goes okay for you. Trust your instincts about doing it or not.
Really_comma_ what happened?
Wow_comma_ I bet that was pretty interesting to look through and remember those days gone by.  I hope the reminiscing was all good memories.
I'm sure that is definitely not true. What makes you think that?
Those type of people are really difficult to deal with. I hope he is open to change.
Being anxious is normal! Be yourself and you will be just fine!
You will be fine! Dont overthink. Just make it a happy day. 
Im sorry to hear that! Are they trying to shame or embarrass you about something. 
You seem like a trusting guy. there are not too many of those these days
Were you embarrassed or what happend?
I know! It can be sentimental at times! You will grow along with them. Enjoy the ride
oh no. what happened?
he didn't punish you... he punished himself! That makes no sense 
That's great. What do you have going on?
Well that's good to hear!
Oh no that's terrible! I'm sorry you had to go through that. Pets are our family.
I'm sorry. I hope memories of your dog bring you comfort.
Do you like it ?
Well_comma_ if you don't_comma_ you won't be the only one.
Oh no that's bad. Did she take any medicine?
Hmm maybe try some propolis. That works for me_comma_ and I have horrible allergies.
Really? That was cool
That is kind of them
Thats so good_comma_am happy for you
Wao_comma_you are so favoured_comma_are u back already?
Did you feel bad about it?
Sometimes we do things that we don't regret at the moment but do later on down the road.
Oh no - what happened?
We've lost several with our girls over the  years.  I understand.
Hopefully you do good on those and the doctor clears you.
You will be okay and get better.
What was a snake doing there?
I don't like snakes either 
what? why would she say that? that's mean
like what? you think she wanna do something bad to you or your brother?
You don't like reading alone? 
Yes_comma_ I can understand that. I'm sorry you don't have anyone to read with. Hopefully that will change in the near future.
Oh_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ you seem upset about it.
Oh wow_comma_ I misunderstood what cheating meant in this context. You can always bounce back and redeem your diet.
There will surely be maggots on that when you get home.
I'll never go to your house in that shape.
I agree!  Especially the green ones.
My husband always says alcohol makes them acceptable.  lol
I would have cried for hours.
I hate spiders and frogs_comma_ and snakes.
I love pizza!  What is you favorite type?
Why do you say that?  It can't be that bad for you_comma_ right?
I try to eat the most junk food possible.
I think i will most likely die before i am thirty.
Oh no that is terrible. I've had that happen once. Did you find him?
I'm so sorry to hear that. I know pets are just like family.
Did the vet fix the dog?
My dog is also like family to me_comma_ so i understand.
That's funny! I agree and it's worse when they aren't your kids.
To each their own. I have 3 and to be honest_comma_ I'm glad they are getting older. Babies suck.
I would have had a great time eating your food.
I do not eat chicken_comma_ but i would have loved the brisket!
I agree_comma_ that was a really scary one! I think it was much creepier than average horror movies.
How long did it take you to not be scared around your own apartment anymore?
Wow_comma_ it really stuck with you a long time.
Sounds like a good night. What movie was it?
That's a perfect way to end the day.
That happens more often that you might think. Just because it's expensive doesn't mean it's any good.
Yep_comma_ probably would have been happier at some hometown diner.
Oh yeah_comma_ I hate that too. It's so inconvenient to be closed when people have time to go there.
I agree. It's about time society caught up.
I'm glad you're ok! It's Sunday_comma_ I'm ok too!
Totally. I'm not working today. How about you?
yea have fun
ok you have a greate time enjoy
Indeed. Are you religious then?
I was raised in a presbyterian church in Scotland_comma_ but haven't been to church in a while. Perhaps I should go. Which church do you attend?
i bet! I wanna go on vacation too! it's been a while. where are you guys going?
I've been to florida once. I went to universal and adventure island parks. so much fun! I hope you guys enjoy your time there
Wow - can you ask them to tone it down at all?  That would drive me crazy!
That is just crazy_comma_ they should not disrupt the complex like that.
that's good to have friends you can count on! what kind of party are you having?
nice! Happy belated birthday :) I hope you had a wonderful time with your friends
That always makes it a great night when your team wins!
You should have placed a bet since you were so confident. You could have won a bundle.
It is always good to have a friend who can take your hand in times of need. I wish I had more of that type of friends
Will you also have his back?
I need to start saving more money honestly.
I like to spend money on food alot.
Ugh_comma_ I absolutely hate it when that happens!  
It's so frustrating!  My dog is elderly so it's been happening more.
That must be very painful for both him and you.
That sounds better than I had thought.
That is not good.  Why do you think it won't come?
That is true.  I have lost packages in the past.
I wish i could afford a vacation like that.
One day i'll try one of those.
Yes he will. 
He's a beautiful reason to get up
Is she still with you?
She will always be with you.
Maybe they just have better taste?
You can get good looks for cheap! Look at second hand clothes_comma_ I've bought lots of designer stuff used.
I would have cried right there.
I can barely walk much less imagine that.
So what do you have for example ?
Oh_comma_ that must be pleasant to remember the good days with.
why is that exactly?
I try to forget about how bad it really all is.
Ok_comma_how do u combine it?
Wao_comma_thats good_comma_it s so refreshing
I am very confused_comma_ i hope one day they will.
Keep talking to them and they will make sure you go first.
That must be very hard for you all_comma_ but I'm sure it will be worth it in the end. What's the exam for?
That's fantastic news! Congratulations to all of you - him for working so hard and passing_comma_ and you for being so patient and understanding.

Good for you. Is it truly your first time flying on a plane?
One advice. Don't freak out when the plane go through some turbulence. It is normal and will only last for couple of minutes
Ouch!  That is not good!  Think of the bright side though.  Better opportunities may present themselves to you!
Don't think that way!  There is always something to look forward to!
Was your dog ok? I hope it didn't run away.
That is awful and I bet your husband feels really bad. I would be really mad though.
you mean you stole it or they gave it to you?
that's not good! That's stealing. if you needed money you should've just asked them for it. You need to tell them what you did
I would have screamed.
You should have checked the entire house!
Wow_comma_ what a show off. Would you say they are nicer by a large margin?
Okay I see your point_comma_ I think they make really eye catching shoes.
I'm really sorry for your loss. At least they still live on through your memories.
That's really awesome. they sound like amazing people. 
 i don't think i know who Rodney Dangerfield is but hey_comma_ good for you! it's awesome when people have a good sense of humor
I need to google him. I've never even heard that phrase lol
That's cool. Do you have a photo album you keep them in?
Oh ok that's a good idea.
The gym always hurts my body when i go.
I hate that feeling so much.
Well_comma_ it's time for a wash then.
Come on_comma_ you can do it.
Summer flys by_comma_ i hope winter lasts a long time.
The winter is where i spread my wings and grow.
Seems like you were well prepared_comma_ did you pass?
That's a very complicated way to say November.
DId you get out and kick them?
I have bad road rage.
i am looking forward to trying to get pregnant by the end of the year
really? we have been trying for 6 years so it's been difficult
I do not think that I want kids.
well i am sure many people do not want to have kids.
i'm sorry. i know how that feels.
your previous conversation. no worries. I love Disney haven't been in 10 years but i love it
How come what do you mean?
Confusion runs deep in me.
That's really great for you! Some people say that praying helps solve anything
That's very true!
I'll always talk to you.
I'll always be for you.
Do you still have the cat?
That's great to hear! I'm glad you kept him around!
i hate when that happens! I stub my toes all the time i'm surprised i didn't break none of them yet
good thing is they heal pretty fast and you don't need a cast or anything like that
I wish you the best of luck_comma_ study hard and you'll do well!
I remember Calc II_comma_ it can be difficult_comma_ but if you practice it's not so bad.
Good for you. What class was it?
I am not really good at chemical science and had much difficulties during high school. Enjoy your moment. You deserved it
that sounds amazing. i haven't seen my family in almost 2 years
i do but they wont come visit and i can't afford to go visit
I'm sorry to hear that. Why don't you join some groups so you can meet some new people. 
Sometimes you just have to reach out to people. Oftentimes other people are feeling the same way and you don't even realize it. 
What happened to cause the change.
Oh_comma_ okay. Take good care of him and he'll always love you.
That is great_comma_ I"m sure you've worked very hard for it.
I'm so glad they are recognizing you for all your efforts.  It feels so nice to be commended for a job well done.
Heck yeah! I loved that game on the n64_comma_ we used to play it all the time in college!
I'll be sure to check this out! My brother has a switch I can "borrow"!
That sounds like a lot of fun_comma_ will you be cooking stuff too?
Sounds like a wonderful day-long event_comma_ hope you enjoy it!
That sounds like a wonderful time. I wish I had the time for that!
That's very true. 
I would feel guilty too if I was in your shoes.  Did you feel bad because you stole or bad because you got caught?
Then why did you do it?
That is a great attitude to have and wonderful that you are so supportive of them.
Some people get jealous when other people are doing well_comma_ so you are truely a good friend
That's awesome! I can say that it's agreat feeling to graduate. 
Yeah_comma_ but now you can go out and make your mark in the real world. 
I bet_comma_ I get home sickness even if I'm gone a couple day.  I bet they are happy to see you as well!
Hope you guys celebrate and eat something good for dinner tonight!
That's awesome does she live far away or just super busy all the time?
Are you going to dinner together or something? 
Oh? And hopefully they did not!
Yeah_comma_ I can see that! Not much you can do though to prevent it. Except for living as healthy as possible!
Wow_comma_ how exciting. Are you going to go?
You can get the pills_comma_ the patch or that bracelet to help.
That is great! What game did you play? Was it fun?
What do you do in that game?
That is nice.  Was the quilt passed down to you from her?
That is great to keep things that remind us of our loved ones
I know that nostalgic feeling. Time really flies.
Absolutely_comma_ that makes me want to go look at some pictures.
Oh that sounds disgusting. Have you talked to him about it?
Oh no! I would be trying to find another place if I were you_comma_ or tell him to find one!
That must be stressful! \
Well if you study hard I'm sure you will do fine. 
I can understand. Ultimately you don't have to be rich to have a kid though
True. Well_comma_ whatever you decide to do I wish you the best!
That is very irresponsible from your side. It is never wise to spend your hard earned money on such leisure
That is the illusion of winning when in reality you are expected to lose
I love physics!
No_comma_ that is normal.
I didn't go to the gym forever! I know how you feel though
i know. I had an anxiety when i first started coming to the gym. I didn't know how to use a couple of machines so i stayed on tradmill the whole time
Oh no_comma_ when did this happen? Do you think you'll find him?
That's sad_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that!
My family was over all weekend and we had a blast.
My family is my whole world.
That's really great! I'm so happy for you!
Well I think you will make a great parent. Congratulations!
I have had problems with that as well. I wish I had some advice to give.
Same here. And that can be very difficult_comma_ as you know!
Why do you do that? Are you scared of the dark?
Well that makes sense then. Good luck staying away from the dark.
That is why you never have kids.
I also keep my room dirty.
I know the feeling! What you have to do is call in sick on a day that you're schedule to go in.
Let me know if it works for you!
That sounds like so much fun! Is this your first time?
You will have a lot of fun. It really is nice there. 
That is wild_comma_ I wish i could write and make money.
Maybe i will look into it.
Awesome! were you surprised?
That's really cool_comma_ I'm glad you were surprised and had a blast!
Ugh yeah same. Did you have a nice weekend though? 
Those kind of weekends are the best. 
thats awesome _comma_ is your pet being trained at a store by chance ? 
even more impressive _comma_ i hope your pet does great
I play some games on my pc_comma_ at times.
I do love me some diablo 3
That's awesome that you are getting to see your family again!
Well I hope that you have a great time!
Oh I know_comma_ they are so annoying. You should try the Do Not Call list.
Well if they violate it they will have to pay you some money. May be good to contact a lawyer!
What is something that you have achieved by following your heart?
That's a great achievement. Buying a house is not easy in this economy!
I would be too! I hope you enjoy your home for many years to come.
oh how fun. what was the play about?
what does that have to do with the school play?
oh. how interesting. i can see why you enjoyed it.
that's always a bonus. it's great to be able to support your children's passions
Yes I only have one dog but he's cool.
Wow that's a lot. I've been thinking about getting a bunny.
It's a lot of work to have pets.
They are cute!
That's awesome! Nothing like freeing up your budget with no car payment.
Congratulations on getting it all paid off_comma_ your wallet is gonna thank you!
That is such a wonderful surprise. You may a great wife for sure.
You should tell her that if you didn't already. A happy wife is a happy life!
Oh no I hope that he pulls through!
Yeah probably. You should take him to the vet right away!
oh no_comma_ was it a big secret? 
Do you think she will ever find out without you telling her? 
Omg! Did you call the police?
Wow! Did the police arrest him or ticket him?
Cool! Where are you from?
Haha_comma_ I live in Florida too_comma_ but grew up in Massachusetts. I swear_comma_ is ANYONE born here?
Nintendo Switch? 
My boyfriend just bought himself one. $300 was way too much for my budget. I'm glad your wife could do that for you.
It is natural that kids grow up and want a little independence.  I know it happened with me.
At least you will always have the memories to look back on
Oh I bet you wanted to over there and yell at them. Some people are so inconsiderate.
If it is too bad you should file a noise complaint with the police. Sometimes that is the only way to get the message across.
Mom's are the best. I miss mine so much so enjoy every single moment you have with her.
I always try to be as good of a mom as my mom was to me. Hard shoes to fill.
That's pretty awesome. The recognition must feel good.
Well it is well deserved. You are an important part of your company.
That is cool. You are very fortunate.
That's really great. I wish I felt that way.
I live in the city too_comma_ I can't stand traffic either.
Oh that sounds even worse than my city! I'm sorry!
That's a smart thing to do! What hurricane was coming? I got hit by Irma pretty bad last year.
I've lived in South Florida all my life_comma_ so I've been through quite a few. As long as you have your supplies you're good to go.
No rest for the weary I guess_comma_ huh?
Yeah treat yourself!
I used to have a giant bag of tools but everything got stolen _comma_ what tool was it 
No matter how old we get_comma_ we will always be children in there eyes sounds like a great man 
Is it his first year?
Oh wow I bet you are proud!
That is awful to hear about. Were you guys together for a long time?
You may try talking to her or taking her out for a nice_comma_ quiet dinner. Some problems can be worked through with good communication.
Sounds like a good boyfriend! Did everything turn out ok?
Awesome_comma_ I'm glad you have someone like that in your life to support you!
Oh wow_comma_ What team was you watching ?
Oh wow! Personally I am a fan of the Falcons.
Oh my god. That's so scary!
Yeah I can imagine. I would be moving out right away!
Disgusting! I hate rodents!
I hope you don't either! If you do_comma_ you may need an exterminator_comma_ or a cat! 
I love cats! Does your cat like to snuggle with you?
That is so cute! We have a cat too but he stays outside on the farm. He is best friends with our chickens!
So sorry to hear about your Mom - I do hope she's better now. In my personal experience_comma_ you can watch and advise all you like_comma_ but they often won't listen - my Mom was like that.
Please don't be so hard on yourself. It's sometimes hard to remind ourselves that our parents are people in their own right and_comma_ while we care very much about them_comma_ at the end of the day they'll do what they think is right.
Exactly! You have to do your thing and she has to do hers. Just by being there if she needs help_comma_ you're doing so much for her!
You are very welcome. I've been there :)
That's great_comma_ it's very useful to have a friend who can bail you out in a time of need.
Definitely help her out if you are ever able_comma_ if she needs anything!
That's great because you really grew as a person.
Maybe later on you will be able to handle greater responsibilities.
Lol that's a really good thing to not have in a diet!
NOOO YOU QUITTER!!!! jkjk treat yourself!
Did he give you a chance to tell your side of the story?
He does not sound like someone who is good to work for.  I'm sorry to hear about his ignorance toward you.
That sounds so fun and relaxing! Did you enjoy yourself?
That sounds so gross! I am so sorry_comma_ I hope you got a refund!
I'm sorry that you are missing them.Maybe you can go home and see them soon?
Yeah I really do too.
Great to hear. I love the new car smell. Take good care of it.
Hope it lasts a long time for you. I am sure you will enjoy it.
Oh no! That's an extremely common thing to happen. Did you recover?
Sorry to hear that. You'll get it next time I'm sure!
Oh no! I'm so sorry. 
Yeah_comma_ but I'm sure no one else would remember it later. 
That's great_comma_ you probably worked very hard so you deserve it.
I'm definitely a bit jealous_comma_ guess I need to work harder.
Awe! Was that recently?
That's awsome! Congrats! 
Nice! What kind of job is it? Are you going to be a manager?
Dang! Hook me up with a job!
I boarded a flight to my destination_comma_ while on board I requested a particular drink _comma_and it was declined
For flimsy reason _comma_it must be an attitude problem
Who was not polite?
Hopefully you don't have to go through anything like that again.
That's terrible of them! I would sit with you!
Hey that really stinks. I hope that you can find someone to sit with you.
What was in there?!
That's hilarious! They sure do! My kids look forward to them!
That's Awesome. Did you change anything lately?
Oh that is awesome. What motivates you?
OH no! Can you return it?
Yeah _comma_ sometimes stuff looks way better on the model.
It's always nice to look back on old memories
Childhood was a lot easier
I agree mothers are great. I appreciate mine as well.
They make so many sacrifices for us. I love to spoil mine on Mother's Day.
Hmmm yeah I maybe would consider moving out. 
Maybe you should have someone go down with you. Safety in numbers?
I am so sorry to hear that. I know what that is like unfortunately.
Yes definitely. My thoughts are with you_comma_ I hope he still has many years left.
Oh_comma_ I love to read as well.  Especially during a rain next to a window.
It can! The quiet can be so calming
When did you feel prepared?
What were you prepared for?
ohh its very seek
its very critical situvation
wow this sounds like a crazy situation.
wow_comma_ well I'm glad this all seemed to work out for you!
thats cool_comma_ dont need a diaper rash
thats usually what happens_comma_ lol. 
Awesome! What was the name of the book?
Didn't they make a movie from that book?
You mean new house? Did you find it for sale really cheap?
Hmm_comma_ perhaps it means something really bad happened there. I would give the Ghostbusters a call.
That is very true! I dono't understand why people doe that!
Yeah they deserve it!
Awesome! Are you going alone?
That's great! Is it for vacation?
I'm not familiar with the hot light term_comma_ what does that mean exactly?
Oh that's a neat feature_comma_ I'm sure they taste better when they're fresh.
It's great to be able to have that trust and bond. Did everything go well?
That's good to hear_comma_ all well that ends well.
On no! Did you ever tell her?
Do you think she will ever give you a second chance? 
That is so sad. I hope it wasn't too hard for him.
Losing a pet is tough for everyone. I completely understand the grief.
Aww man yeah we get really attached to our pets huh?)
I'm sure she is.  All the fish flakes she can eat.
That is horrible.  What is the treatment for it?
I wish your cat the best.  I know it must be hard
Oh cool_comma_ is it for work or fun?
You sound really well prepared!
How badly did you slip up? You're allowed cheat days
That's quite a big slip up... I'm not even sure how you'd do that.
Yeah I like looking at my old pictures too!
Yeah it is good to think about the good ol' days!
Wow_comma_ you must be euphoric!
How lucky!  Don't get crazy though.  invest form the future.
That's crazy. Where did it come from?
Strange the receptionist did that. I bet everyone wanted to pet the puppy!
That's exciting. When is it?
Christmas day huh? What made you decide that?
dont understand you_comma_were you chased by a hurricane?
ok _comma_so what was the time frame of evacuation?
That is annoying!  Is someone in your house not doing there job cleaning after themselves.
That is no good.  What are you going to do about it?
How nice of them. My oldest is paying her own way. I wish I was in a situation that I could help her more.
I'm sure it was a huge relief not having to worry about loans. I'm still dealing with mine and I graduated in 2008.
oh my goodness that is horrible!
I am sure it does.  I am really sorry about all of that.
This happened to us last spring. Our dog was 8 years old. It can be a very emotional time but it gets better over time. Have you thought about creating a memorial for him? Maybe a photo collage to hang.
I know how you feel. Just know that it gets better and try to think about the great life he had because of you and your love!
that is great are you on a business journey or Holiday 
i will be staying at home 
What happened?
That sounds very lonely and sad.
We watch the twilight zone too on new years. What is bomb food ?
I see. I usually reflect a lot on new years_comma_ thinking of the past_comma_ and looking to the future.
nice _comma_ just relaxing after a long week that sounds perfect honestly
right it would be awesome to have 3 days off_comma_ but this is the real world 
you need not to be afraid as long as you've prepared very well
yes_comma_ i believe you are
That is great news! I'm sure you are excited! Congratulations to you two!
I bet you two will have a long and great marriage!
You make it out of wood or is it one of those aluminum ones?
Good for you.  There's nothing quite like the sense of pride assocaited with building something!
Ah_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ is it for work or something else?
That does suck_comma_ well maybe you guys can work something out to see each other every so often.
I hope so_comma_ is your car in bad shape?
Just a month? Not that long to wait_comma_ but better be careful in the meantime so you won't be left somewhere far from help.
Wow_comma_ heard that is a tough test_comma_ good luck and I'm sure you are prepared.
Good luck_comma_ and a future congratulations on killing it!
That's awful. Where's she staying now ?
I'm glad she's got you to look after her.
That sounds so relaxing!
I hope you enjoy it!
That's awesome_comma_ reading is my favorite past time as well.  What book?
Oh I've read that_comma_ That is a really good book_comma_ I even enjoyed the movie as well.
Maybe you should talk with him about how you feel?
Well at least you can say you tried. Sometimes teenagers need to figure it out on their own.
That is so_comma_ so sad. Are they going to separate or is there a chance that he can change his ways and earn her trust again?
It is very difficult_comma_ but I've see marriages recover from that position - but it takes years to build up that trust again properly. I wish them all the best
Oh gross_comma_ you should bail quick if you see a kid getting sick_comma_ so that you won't be around to help clean it up.
I'm sorry_comma_ maybe a nose plug would come in handy
as a matter of fact my friend asked me help him move recently _comma_ but i was busy at work too he understood 
we cant win them all _comma_ but work always comes first 
How'd it taste? And what kind of cake was it?
Well_comma_ look at the bright side - you got a cake for the anniversary of you becoming a parent to your daughter_comma_ and your daughter still gets cake.  I kinda think everyone wins there!
That sounds really great! What movie are you going to see?
It really is! I hope that you have a good time!
That's pretty scummy_comma_ has he always been like that?
You should have a talk with him and let him know how you feel.
No way! that's gross
I hope they at least fixed it for you!
That sounds so fun!
That is great! I'm sure they will enjoy it like you did!
Very good. You must be handy around the house - I'm useless! Lanais are wonderful - and necessary in many places!
Smart move. Wish I could do stuff like that. You should be very proud of yourself :)
I think you should take the rest of the day of and relax in your new lanai. You can sit and bask in the glory of a job well done!
Is this your first?
Thats awesome are you having it ?
Uh oh. What happened?
That was a sweet surprise. Is everything okay now?
Don't think that well! As long as you are prepared_comma_ you will do great!
Ah_comma_ yeah_comma_ I struggled with that too_comma_ but if you try hard enough you will get through it.
That sounds like a lot of fun. Do you live in the country?
Awesome_comma_ you will have a blast. Make sure to stay safe.
That is adorable! I bet you were proud!
Awww! That's great!
Oh no I hope she's ok!?
Lol pour water on it next time. Always does the trick!
I'm not suprised. I always did that as a kid.
Yeah the only way he will learn is if he figures it out by himself. 
Awww_comma_ that's sweet! He was lucky to find such a great partner!
Oh no! You can't do that to your friend! You'll find the right single person in time!
The perfect person for you will come soon enough
Stay positive!
Yum! What type of food was it?
I love burgers! You're making me hungry!
I would be upset too. You need to sit down and talk to him about it
you're a good parent. Keep up a good work
Please call the police_comma_its called noise abuse
Thats what you have to put up with with the wrong neighbors
Aw_comma_ can't fit any classes into your schedule?
Oh congratulations_comma_ you must be smart!
Aw_comma_ That's awesome.  The training paid off and I bet she feels really proud!
Haha_comma_ I bet_comma_ when she becomes a pro you can say you've been her fan since day one!
I hope you got a warranty on it. New cars should not have issues for a while.
Well perhaps you got a lemon. I would ask for a new car if it happens again.
Oh no! I hope that you are getting better!
That's awesome that you have such a great partner! 
Isn't it fun to think of times like that. When you were free of most responsibilites?
What year did you graduate?
That is great that they are willing and able to help.
I bet that was such a relief for you guys!
Oh wow I bet you were really proud?
I'm sure he will! Best of luck to him!
That's the worst_comma_ when they take forever.. Have you called them up?
Yeah_comma_ I understand_comma_ they should at least give you a discount!
I feel jealous I didn't get the artistic genes my brother got lol
Probably! Makes me feel better now lol
That's really awesome! You are a really lucky person!
That's so awesome. I wish my godmother did that!
That is awesome. I am sure she will do great.
And think one day she may be able to save your life haha.
Oh i can relate_comma_ that happened to me with UberEats a couple days ago. Its so frustrating!
Yeah its the worst when they don't own up to it_comma_ makes me want to use the competitors service just to spite them. Very annoying.
Oh no! At least you noticed now
Yes and also explain to them you noticed you were doing it. They'll understand
How many slices did you ate?
That's a lot for anyone_comma_ lol
I've done this before! It can be very nostalgic to see old friends that you haven't seen in awhile. Did it bring back any particular memories?
You could always make a collage with your favorite pictures! 
I sort of have. I worked like crazy to get a work visa for the US_comma_ so I could be with the person I wanted to spend my life with. It paid off_comma_ so I can kind of understand what you're saying.
Scotland. It's quite a process getting in here_comma_ despite what some people try to tell you! What happened with you?
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
Well stay focused and work hard! You got this!
Maybe you could get out and meet some new people.
Sounds like a plan.
Yeah arcades are pretty sweet. I like that some of them have bars in them now. 
I'm not surprised. It also helps me play better!
Congratulations and I'm sure you will do fine.  Do you think you will enjoy doing it?
It'll be a good experience at the very least_comma_ good luck!
Who are you talking about?
that is sad. why would he gossip! that's so low
That could be so hard on you
Just keep your mind occupied with other important stuff
Congrats! Is this your first child?
I think you will do fine! You will be in love at first sight for your!
Congratulations_comma_ she must be a quick one_comma_ I was always the slow one at the back of the pack.
Wow_comma_ that's impressive_comma_ she might get a scholarship one day!
I imagine_comma_ that must be so awful. Have you had that before?
I hope the doctor can help you get the pain away!
Aw_comma_ that's sweet_comma_ I'm glad you love her so much!
That's good_comma_ no body should ever cheat in my opinion!  At least end the relationship first.
Oh my god. That's aweful!
Well he sounds really irresponsible. I would make him pay for the damages. 
Tell me about it_comma_ they have to be in my top 5 things I hate the most.
Plus they are so small it's harder to kill them for me. Flies are larger so I have an easier time getting rid of them.
Uggh_comma_ what a buzzkill.
I'd say that is definitely true for you now.
ok and how does that work
thats awesome but would you?
Ok _comma_why would you do that?
Call her back then since you miss her like crazy
No way! That's sad for the man but gross for you
Wow that is disgusting
That's awesome! Where are you vacationing to?
I love the beach! I'm sure you'll have a great time there.
I hate spiders! Especially if you know theres one in the room where you are sleeping!
Haha sorry_comma_ I've been in that position and chose to sleep on the couch because of it!
That's really great that you have such a great partner like her!
I would be the same without my wife too!
Aw_comma_ dang_comma_ sounds like he is battling it very well though!
Ouch_comma_ I'm very sorry for your loss! You did your best_comma_ and I'm sure he is in heaven now looking over you!
I can definitely understand how you would be worried about that.  I think I'd have to decline - LOL!  You are a good person for being willing to meet with him.
Well_comma_ yes if there is a child involved_comma_ then you've got to deal with him at some point.  I hope it goes well for you though.
I've never watched a single full star wars movie_comma_ just bits and pieces haha
Thanks_comma_ I will look into it! Maybe get caught up before the new movie comes out!
You must have been surprised! Were you happy about it?
Sounds great!  What a good idea your mom had!
No way! That must have smelled so bad
I can imagine eww
Aww man sorry for your loss_comma_ those are the worst_comma_ its like losing your best friend. I hope he passed away peacefully and happy.
Aww shoot_comma_ I lost a dog when i was little in a very tragic way as well. I miss that big guy_comma_ he was like a brother to me. Hope you're doing good now_comma_ he's in a good place.
It's okay! A cheat weekend every now and then can be well deserved when on a diet! Start right now eating healthy again! You can do it!
That's awesome! Good luck with your diet!
Congratulation!  It is really smart to be as prepared as possible!  This baby will change your world!
That is good.  It will make you quite happy.  I couldn't imagine life without my kid now!
Ouch! That's the worst_comma_ are they pretty damaged?
Oh well_comma_ shake it off and keep flaunting that nice car! :)
Good for you! It's always so satisfying to look back and see how much you've achieved.
Nothing wrong with sleep - along with food it's what keeps us going! How many hours do you work?
Yum_comma_ what is she cooking?
Yum that sounds delicious! I'm a vegetarian as well_comma_ I will have to look into the recipe for that!
Oh wow. No I've never had to deal with that before. I hope your husband is ok!
That's awesome that you had such a great support network to help you. 
Umm..did you MEAN to kick it?
They are kinda like rats with wings.
Aw_comma_ poor fellow_comma_ well I'm sure he was close to his home.
There's always next time_comma_ forgive yourself and help the next pupper you see!
Oh you must be so sad_comma_ I know I would be if that had happened to me.
That is great! I have a dog that I adopted in similar circumstances. 
Oh god no_comma_ my heart would be racing. Were you scared?
Damn_comma_ i can't imagine ever going through that. I hope it was something minor and didn't affect you too much.
Wow that intense_comma_ we all make mistakes though hope youre doing better!
Sounds great! Yes relaxing time is always needed and appreciated.
Hope you enjoy your week off! Sounds like you earned it :)
I take the bus so I don't have to deal with the traffic_comma_ but man that sounds like it would really stink
Wow he sounds like jerk!
I used to enjoy doing that with my grandmother_comma_ she'd tell me all about when my dad was little.  I love old stories like that.
What an interesting field - my husband would love to say that was his profession!
oh oh_comma_ so now you don't know where your enemy is hiding.  Sounds scary.
How annoying_comma_ but would be wise imagine it jumping on you while you sleep.
What kind of chair is it? A lounging chair_comma_ or maybe  a computer desk chair?
Oooh_comma_ that'll be really good. It aught to be really comfortable too.
Sweet!_comma_ must be a really big pool if you have to wait until next summer. 
Oh yeah_comma_ gets too cold. I've always wanted one of those concrete pools. I'm stuck with an above ground one for now until i get enough money for one. 
So what would you do to halt that?
Thats thoughtful!\
That's not good_comma_ do you think he will pay you?
You can take out a loan_comma_ but good luck_comma_ I hope you get it!
And no one told you about it?  Maybe no one noticed it at all?
That is horrible!  I hope they realize that their reaction was not exactly nice.
Oh my! I hope is ok!
Yeah that is a really suckying thing to do to you. 
So how does he afford such luxury?
Ok _comma_he shouldn't have stopped! Other kids deserves it too
How so?
Hard work usually pays off. Which exams are you taking?
I hope she recovers soon. I know it is hard to see loved ones sick.
That is good to hear. I am sure she will be fine.
Good for you! You are a lucky person!
That's great! I'm a bit jealous.
Yeah i've been through that feeling before_comma_ I had a show that was going to get cancelled but thankfully it got saved by another company. What show was yours?
Oh i've heard of that show_comma_ never got around to seeing it though. That sucks!
That's really great. I'm happy for you.
Congratulations_comma_ it sounds like you've really made it. I envy you.
I'm sorry to hear that you couldn't finish it! What couldn't you finish?
Hey you are being too hard on yourself. I'm sure your boss would prefer it done well and not rushed. 
Yes! I always cried when I watched it as a child.
Yes! My kids cried too 
Oh I love the thrill of a good roller coaster.
It's definitely not for everyone. You either love them or you don't.
I could imagine. Dogs are amazing.
Definitely. Hold on to those.
Thats great_comma_ family comes first over everything!
Yep_comma_ they're always there for you no matter what
Awe! Really I was planning on seeing it this weekend. 
Really? What was the main disappointment? 
Thats nice_comma_hope you will host them well?
Uhmmnn! never knew you had room mates
Oh my! Were you scared? What did you do?
Well_comma_ I'm glad you're in one piece now!
Omg yes_comma_ mosquitos are awful. Do you use any spray?
Nothing seems to for sure keep those things away but the bites are the worst.
Oh no! I hope it din't take that much to get in. 
Yeah but at least you didn't have to pay someone to break into your car for you. 
I've been enjoying them too_comma_ but not quite as much as the originals. It's not my generation anymore.
But_comma_ he's got little to do with it at this point.
I don't know much about cryptocurrency at all.  You were brave to invest in a new thing_comma_ but I'm sorry that you lost money.
Maybe you can find a new investment that will give great returns and you can recoup what you lost.
Are you feeling more lonely than you expected?
I get that way too when my kids are away for too long. It's good to find someone to hang out with to keep yourself occupied.
It's called the hour of the wolf. 
Yes_comma_ look it up_comma_ it's quite interesting.
Where are you going?
What type of trip are you planning?
Oh don't stress it_comma_ i've done that so many times. It happens
Yeah_comma_ or buy pants without zippers. But don't stress it_comma_ i'm sure whoever saw it didn't really mind!
Oh that sounds exciting. I've always wanted to go.
I've flown but not much and never left the country either. I hope y'all have fun :)
There's some decent benefits to doing things the old way. 
Got anything specific you like to be traditional about?
Yes_comma_ I'm a picky eater.
Yes_comma_ I hate that. I usually end up going back and getting some more just for me.
Thats awesome_comma_ i cant imagine not having AC in this hot florida weather!
Yeah the heat isn't as bad but mix it with humidity and you've got the worst possible combination. Its terrible!
That sounds like such a surprise. Does he have a disability that keeps him at home?
That's great to hear! My papa is getting older too. It's nice to be able to spend time with him.
Oh awesome_comma_ what part of Florida?
Oh that sounds really fun and I bet she will love it all. I'm jealous :)
wow _comma_try next time!
well_comma_ thats how fate would have it
I'm sorry to hear that.  What happened?
I know how frustrating it can be when we receive so an awful service.  They should train people to do a better job.
That is so sad. I know how it feels to lose a pet.
I lost a goldfish once. She was my best friend.
Bet you'll be glad to have some free time on your hands at last.
lol - yeah I can relate. Kids can be a real handful when they don't have structure - as in during the summer months.
Why do you say that?
Okay now I understand... COMPLETELY! I deal with that daily! I am ready to give up on ever cleaning again.
That sounds rather convenient. Are you giving up anything for that?
If it's too traumatic for him_comma_ you can always try to put him back.
Oh my goodness! What did you do? I bet your heart was racing!
hahaha that sounds about how I would have reacted! I once saw my shadow on the blinds in my living room. I sat there frozen thinking someone was outside. Then_comma_ I moved and the shadow did too!
Thats awesome_comma_ i dont have kids yet but i was also looking through some old school photos of me and my friends. Such innocent times.
Yes it does_comma_ I wish her the best! early adulthood is the best time!
I agree and it's full of commercials no one wants to see.
Oh yes_comma_ I know what you are saying. I've never been into GOT but I've heard it's good. 
I would be so mad. I can't believe people can do that and sleep at night
I hope so too. That is just not right. They could have left a note at least.
wow! love birds_comma_how nice_comma_so where exactly are you headed?
Well_comma_it would be a whole new experience for you
How annoying! Did she fix it fast?
That would be frustrating. Did it get corrected? Did you still have to pay?
im sorry thats awful_comma_ i hope he makes a full recovery
i can only imagine!
That's cool_comma_ what is the position?
Don't wish_comma_ demonstrate. Do something that reflects what type of supervisor you're going to be. People love previews.
Give me an example?
I get it. It does seem like they are always coming out with another version.
Oh_comma_ that's too bad. Perhaps have the picnic indoors? It wouldn't be the same_comma_ but at least you could share food and have a laugh!
I can imagine. That's the problem with planning outside events - we can't dictate the weather. You should try planning something outdoors in Scotland_comma_ where I'm from - soggy food every time!!
Who has cancer? Someone you know?
Well I am no cancer expert. Probably should get a second opinion from a doctor.
LoL....no sweetie_comma_ I'm sure it's your dog again. Didn't the same thing happen last month?
Oh sorry about that I thought you had a dog. Well then maybe the noise the some type of critter. Have you checked under the bed today?
I remember that. A lot of people were grossed out and didn't want to do it. Were your girls one of them?
Yea_comma_ it tends to be kinda gross. My teacher had us dissect fish as well and I prefere that much more for some reason
I sure hope they are trustworthy.
It is so good to have someone that is trustworthy no matter what you tell them.  I'm glad you have a friend like that.
I'm so sorry to hear that_comma_ my girlfriend's cat is going through the same thing right now. It can't be easy.
That's so sad... The best thing you can do is spend lots of time with her and make every minute count. I wish you all the best.
Usually people want someone in their life. I guess that takes staying away from others.
Some people prefer to be alone. Whatever makes them happy I suppose.
I would laugh so hard if that was me seeing my dog do that
I hope you can share it on social media so that the whole world can share in the fun :)
i do too_comma_ its a shame
i am too_comma_ i hope we can make a change before it is too late
Lucky for you! I'm at work right now! Haha!
No_comma_ its fine! Enjoy your day off_comma_ I definitely would if I were you!
Oh_comma_ that's awful. Were you okay_comma_ or did you have to go to the hospital?
That sounds terrifying! I've never been in a car accident_comma_ and sure wouldn't like to be in one.
oh wow did it bring back memories?
That is so fun!  Memories are always a wonderful thing to have
Well it is good to be thankful. We have to remember all the little things.
It is good to appreciate what we have_comma_ not opine for what we don't have.
I hope you got it on camera_comma_ I would if i was in your shoeas
Nice_comma_ buddy he will thank you for it when he grows up
Awww good for him! 
I'm glad he's getting better with his speech and I hope he continues to improve!
I hate when that happens. I'm so bad with directions.
What did you end up doing?
I depend so heavily on my GPS_comma_ i don't know what i would have done
Oh that's great news. I bet he is having lots of fun.
That's great. Some people can go through college and still don't know what they want to do.
That's a ton of oysters! I don't think I've even ever eaten one oyster. What's a mixed plate? 
Hmm it's funny how seasonings and spices really alter the viability of a food. Was the buffet all seafood?
That is awesome to hear _comma_ i bet the pays good too 
if your happy there i would stay if not seek the better pay in a different town 
Oh man that had to be embarrassing.  I know how you feel though b/c I once went to work with two different shoes on
Well it will probably never happen again so don't worry about it to much
I'm so sorry. I know that must be very difficult for you. It's nice that you have pictures to look at and remember old times together.
Pictures are a great way to remember the past. I treasure every picture. Each holds a special memory.
We all do it. I bet they deserved it.
They sound like my kids. I hope they start behaving better for you.
Dogs can be so destructive.
Poor thing had no clue why you were mad
Ok _comma_so are you gonna go?
thats nice
Dang three times?  I hope you get that figured out!
Yeah get that right.  Make sure you don't fail it four times!
How shocking! I have got to know_comma_ are you keeping the puppies or giving them up for adoption?
Good idea. I hope they aren't too much of a handful until then!
Oh that sounds horrible. I hope it wasn't a long ride on the bus. 
Oh no_comma_ that is a long time to be sitting in trash basically.
i bet so. its a shame when people dont take care of their teeth
i wouldnt doubt it!
I have found that using alot of online recipes with good instructions helps. Cannabis also induces hunger and reduced adhd thus it helps me pay better attention_comma_ even more so when I'm hungry af! 
yes I always pay attention to the reviews and peoples personal comments_comma_ they can often be priceless!
Not that I can think of. Can you give me an example?
Oh_comma_ I see what you mean. That's frustrating!
Did you at least study for it?
That is the best feeling!
Oh wow_comma_ that really sucks. Did you ever find the culprit?
Yeah_comma_ I would've definitely quit once I saw that.
I hate when they do that! Were you able to clean the rug?
I bet! Time to get him trained a little better.
Wow that is huge. He must have a lot of stuff to haul.
As long as he remembers to make wide turns. Otherwise bad things happen haha.
Has it ever been a ghost?
Yeah fears like that are pretty unconsolable.
That's so awesome! What did he say?
Oh my. What a strange first word.
I'm not quite sure I understand_comma_ did you go bowling by yourself? If so that's so sad and lonesome.
As someone who deals with lonesome moments_comma_ I know how that feels. I would've totally gone with you had I known you haha.
did you feel like being spontaneous or just did it for the thrill of it
next time you go in_comma_ put the money of the candy into one of those charity cans
Yeah me too! Are you going to go with anyone?
Nice! I am sure it is going to be a ball of a time.
That is a real bummer. Maybe you should take some time to reflect on their life.
Yeah_comma_ no need to talk to me about it right now. Think about all the good times you had together.
That really stinks. Have you gone to get some help on it?
I am sure he will be able to help you. I hope you pass.
Oh no. That sounds like a messy situation.
Hopefully he'll learn that that's not the place to do that.
I am sure once you clean up your scruffy look you'll be able to land all the ladies.
Nah_comma_ you can forgo deodorant. The media just tells everyone it's necessary since it's a poorly known method of government mind control.
He must be related to my dog. Was it hard to clean up?
You may want to check his diet. Something in not right there.
That is so awesome! Good for her!
Amazing! I would be proud if I were you as well!
Really_comma_ I can't believe you like it. Are you sure he bought it and not his mom lol?
Either way you have the perfect outfit to go on a date with your boyfriend right?
Oh no! Is your dog trained to go outside?
I'm sorry to hear that. Just take some deep breaths_comma_ wear gloves and maybe even a mask if it makes you feel better. You can do this and you'll be alright!
Yeah_comma_ I am the same way. Incredibly unsafe to do such a thing.
I know. I don't want to die doing something incredibly mundane.
i hope you feel bad about what you did 
as long as you can live with yourself _comma_ is all that matters lol
That sounds very relaxing. What kind of book was it?
Oh I get that magazine too. I like it for the stories.
Dang. What did you by? Mountain dew and doritos?
A much better purchase than the neckbeard's staple. I hope you won!
That sucks_comma_ was it a nice rug?
That's awful_comma_ put the dogs nose in it.
Nice! Which one you getting?
Dang! Now that is a savvy phone! I have 12 of them.
Aw how wonderful. She must have been really proud of herself and happy.
Truth be told: I never learned how to ride a bike.
That sounds like an interesting life choice. It's probably very calming.
It's an important tool set to have!
Have you been studying? If you do that_comma_ I am sure you won't fail.
Nice! I am sure you will pass with flying colors.
You are the 2nd one today. Was it a mile high?
That must have been quite the workout. At least you should have plenty of fuel for the winter.
oh thats a nice surprise
thats really cool
Shocking. Does that not happen often for you?
Ah well better than me. I get it so much it doesn't even bother me anymore.
Lol owning it is just about the only thing you can do at that point!
I hope nobody in your office is the easily offended type!
Nice! Did you steal anything while you were there?
Well_comma_ at least you filled your stomach. Next time_comma_ don't forget about your pockets!
Congratulations_comma_ thats amazing.  What did he say?
Wow_comma_ hes a pretty smart kid.  He must be reading up on his history and the communist manifesto.
That's too bad. Did someone cut you off?
Awww I would be sad too. Did anyone go and get it?
Understandably so. You must be pretty anxious over the whole ordeal.
That's a great idea. No need to let go of the place you call home completely. I hope everything works in your best interests!
thats fair tho i wouldnt worry about it
good luck with that
That is a very nice friend. Moving is hard work.
Hope you don't have to move again any time soon.
I hate when that happens.  I bet that smelled great.
My dog did that the other day.  I yelled at her and told her that we don't poop in the house
Nice! Did you fall?
Oh no! Well_comma_ at least it sounded like you and everyone had a good time.
eww i know how that feels
i would be too
Oh geez! I bet that was a CATastrophe!
I bet. I would've been sick.
lol sorry for laughing _comma_ but that sounds like something i would agree to and forget_comma_ im afraid of heights too 
sometimes when my friends are annoying me _comma_ i tune out ... later o yeah we are supposed to do this today and blah _comma_ blah _comma_ blah
Oh_comma_ that's a good point! I never realized how much money I was spending for fast food until I started making a budget.
My go to lazy-sandwich are fried balogna sandwiches. It's saved me a lot of money_comma_ that's for sure.
That sucks. Are you hurt?
I would be mad too. Are you going to sue?
thats so amazing
thats so cool
That is unfortunate. I hope it wasn't 1 or 2 miles high?
That amount of poop really does things to a rug. I recommend getting a new house.
That sucks. Did you ever find any worms in the apples?
Yeah_comma_ if only I could go back and have a crisp apple with some snake oil...all would be right with the world.
Mustve been some good convincing.  Was it a robbery?
Yea_comma_ my phone is pretty expensive.  Im not giving my phone to anybody
im not sure i think its just an old tradition
yea i hate clowns too
Where did you lose it at?
Yeah_comma_ that is a good thing he found it and not someone else. What are the odds.
They are so lucky. I would love to have a new car.
I would be jealous_comma_ because I drive an old clunker 
Oh no! That's horrible. Were you able to clean it up?
I could imagine.
thats great_comma_ good job.
yea i tend to have similar issues
happy birthday! are you exciteD?
i hope you have a great time
Oh boy_comma_ did you embarrass yourself by getting real scared?
That's something that's easy to laugh about after the fact but I bet you were running for your life when it happened! Haha
I know what you mean.  Its an easy chore_comma_ but sometimes that smell is gross.  Its that sweet smell. yuck
Well now i definitely don't want to take the garbage out tonight.  Ill make someone else do it
oh really? why was that?
understandable_comma_ no one should have to go hungry
That's horrible! What happened?
That really sucks. I am glad you are okay.
That really sucks. Maybe you should get another job?
I am truly sorry for your lots. I am sure things will get better.
Well that's great! I'm guessing he has a bad habit of doing that?
I guess you've been training him and it's paying off? Tell him he's a good boy and give him a belly rub!
Oh that's so aggravating_comma_ my dog still has accidents but not many
That's terrible but the rug is replaceable. 
im sorry to hear that_comma_ my child hood friend died in a car crash _comma_ and it hurt me for a really long time_comma_ i still have dreams about him through out the years
his family must be going through some tough times right now _comma_ i hope everything goes well
I've actually heard a little bit about CBD oil from my sister_comma_ but I never did any research myself or try it out.
Oh wow_comma_ so it actually works? I might have to give it a try and let me mother know about it_comma_ she has a lot of pain in her legs as well.
I absolutely will! Thanks for the suggestion.
That sounds like so much fun.  What concert is it?
Don't stop believin.  I bet you'll have a great time!
I wouldn't look forward to that either. What are you going in for?
That doesn't sound grand at all. Hopefully it is a painless procedure.
That's super nice of her!
Good parents are super useful!
That sounds like a job!
I wish you good luck with that!
Why did you steal candy from the store?
Did you not have any money to pay for it?
Oh no!  Is that the first time it has happened?
May I recommend gloves?  Thick gloves.  And a lot of carpet cleaner.
Wow_comma_ that really stinks. Did you catch the culprit?
Yeah_comma_ especially since I imagine that is a costly monthly expense. I would install some turrets in your garage.
That's always fun to clean up.
Think of it this way. Yesterday I had to clean up my dog's vomit_comma_ where it vomited up a used tampon.
Nice! Which game is it?
Sounds really fun! I think I will pick it up today.
That's cool. What city?
Oh sweet. I hope he has a good time in college.
Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. How long did you have your rabbit for?
I could imagine. I don't have any pets. But I understand it can be really devastating.
Oh no! We're you able to clean it up?
Yeah hopefully it doesn't happen again!
Ew! Sounds like a disgusting job.
That's great! Good to hear you're saving some money!
I do too_comma_ but seems like most people are like that nowadays
I would be mad_comma_ we had that problem all the time at the last place we lived. 
Oops. Could you sneak it back in without him seeing you?
Depends how close you are and how mad he'll be. Usually_comma_ I advocate honesty_comma_ but don't know enough about your situation to advise.
Oh boy. I honestly don't know what to say. Maybe ask him outright if he's cheating. If he is_comma_ do you really want to stay with him? If not_comma_ it doesn't matter if he knows about the phone or not!
Good luck! But be nice - I've confronted people before and totally lost it. I then regretted it.
That sucks_comma_ hope it didn't dry into the carpet.
That's pretty understandable.
thats great_comma_ good job
i know that feel
Nice! Where is he going to school at?
Wow_comma_ that's pretty far away. How do you feel about him going all the way up there?
dangit _comma_ i would have been pretty upset _comma_ not to mention the clean up 
shhhhhheeeeess _comma_ that would have given me a small heart of attack or just tunnel vision out of rage
That's so sad! Maybe you should give him a call?
That's the spirit! The loneliness should melt away!
Oh no!! You must have been so mad!
That dog probably wouldn't be living in my house anymore!! Did you have it cleaned?
That is not good.  Did you scold your cat?
I can imagine.  My dog used to stain the carpet too.
That really sucks. What kind of car was it?
Ah_comma_ I used to have one of those. Those cars were built to last.
I think the opposite_comma_ honestly.
Yeah I know_comma_ thanks.
What happened?? You did not studied hard enough?
the best thing for you is learn from this and do better next time 
That was nice of your neighbor! I hope everything was still inside of it!
That's such a relief! It's such a hassle to cancel all of your credit cards and get a new ID! You should give him a reward!
Nice! What grade is your son in?
Nice! I am sure he is going to be hanging with the popular folk in no time.
Ha! At least you're confident in your skills. Do you do anything special to it?
That is all good to know! I'll have to keep it in mind next time I cook it.
That is terrible_comma_ I am so sorry. Was it of natural causes?
You can just replace him that fast? Don't you need time?
Thats pretty brave of you facing a fear like that.  How did you feel when the flight was over?
Flights are convenient though.  Definetly faster than driving somewhere
How exciting! Where to?
I am happy for you and hope you have a lot of fun!
Congratulation! thats awesome. I know how much work that can be
You'll get there one day.  It takes time and saving 
Lol are they still holdig that against you?
Lol. We all cheated at some point.  They know that.
Did you try to find someone to go with?
Maybe you should find some new friends.
Mine did too - 5 minutes ago_comma_ actually. Are you thinking about getting a new one?
That's too bad. Perhaps it would help you heal your troubles away.
Hell yeah! Return of the king!
Yup_comma_ he's been through a lot
That must of looked really bad.
Why not buy another gift?
It's nice he showed up. He doesn't normally ?
Oh_comma_ I'm sorry. At least he was able to make it this time!
That is lucky!  I left mine in a restaurant last week and luckily someone turned it in!
yes.  I love that most people are honest
That stinks_comma_ did you clean it up?
Will you get rid of the cat now?
Same here. Maybe we ate at the same one?
Me too! NYC? We should sue and become millionaires.
Me too! What is your favorite exercise to do?
Pullups are great! I am more of a pushup man myself.
Oh no I hope you were able to clean it up!
Dang I hate when dogs do that crap! (pun intended)?
Aww that is very nice of you! Are you two very friendly with one another?
I hope you two eat something great next time too!
That's good! Any particular reasons why?
oh_comma_ damn! I wish I had one of those. That must be super nice.
What are you helping her with?
That is nice of you to help_comma_ but why does she need you to give her money?
Cool_comma_ how long did that take?
That's good to hear that he was nice then.
that really sucks
i bet it does
Well that's lousy of them! What did you want them to help you with?
Yuck_comma_ that's stressful enough without having your friend flake on you. Sorry to hear that.
that sounds quite fun.
i hate heights so rollercoasters arent my thing_comma_ good luck with that
Niiice. What kind of things did it have?
Eeep! I think you're gonna give me nightmares.
I'm just about to have my second child! Shopping with one is tough_comma_ getting a sitter sounds like a great idea!
Shopping with kids sounds like a nightmare! Thanks for the great tip!
That's a shame_comma_ if that's the case then I agree.
Not really_comma_ but I hope you're alright.
Do you get enough sleep at night? Try getting to bed earlier at night
It's hard for me to wake up early. I have to cut my cellphone usage down or I'll be up all night looking at youtube! 
That's a bummer. Did you at least go get it resolved at the bank?
That's quite unfortunate then. Gotta be more careful with that!
Oh yeah I could imagine. I've always lived in big cities. I couldn't imagine having to deal with true darkness and wild animals!
Yeah. I do remember camping out a few times back in school. I couldn't get used to the pitch blackness at all!
That's awesome! Sometimes pulling through a tough battle is more satisfying than just winning outright! Shows perseverance and a "never give up" attitude.
Oh yeah. Makes for a great game when it's close!
I am so happy for you! I have been married for ten years and it is the most rewarding thing ever. But you should be nervous because in two months you have to share everything.
Thank you . Well lets talk about the wedding_comma_ hopefully you have a wedding planner to help you right. I don't want you to stress out to much_comma_ you are the excited bride!
Well good_comma_ let her do all the worrying and you focus on your big day!
Oh wow_comma_ that's kind of rude.
Have you brought it up to her? Maybe she doesn't realize she's doing it.
where did it go?
I hope so_comma_ hope is still alive_comma_ and Have you search everywhere?
Oh no! How did you find out?
Ah_comma_ I see. I hope you find someone more respectful and caring
Oh that is awesome! Even barely awesome employers are hard to find.
Yeah they generally have a better chance at giving it more so than large entities.
Oh yeah_comma_ especially when it is something you are really looking forward to receiving.
Yep_comma_ but at least we have the internet to take care of those things.
did you try redoing your steps of the last day? to see maybe you left it at a friends house
i feel bad for you_comma_ have you tried asking other people that are near you often to see if they have seen it?
What do you love about football season? (They're football right?)
Wonderful! Good luck_comma_ I hope they win.
What are they repeating?
I hope you can provide them with some help.
It's awesome. Sometimes I also try to find solutions in youtube.
Yeah_comma_ you're right.
That's terrible. Did you guys clear that out?
People must have no lives to want to spread rumors like that.
Oh my. How did you handle the situation with your toddler?
They can be pretty crazy at that age.
I bet your so excited! I just got one last month too and it makes my life so much easier!
AOL slow Lol.. I certainly know how you feel! I would have expedited it to me!
where did he go
oh sorry to hear that
I'm assuming they didn't leave insurance info?
That sucks_comma_ man. Are you gonna get it fixed?
Yikes_comma_ high risk investment?
Is it something that can recover over time? I hope so
A lot of marriages also end in divorce_comma_ when they go into it too soon.
You'll find someone. You sound like a good person.
why did your friendship with your friend ended?
that is true i agree with you_comma_ that is not what friends do
For what purpose you do this
How his your health now
You sound lonely. Do you not have any friends?
Have you considered joining any hobby groups to make some new friends?
oh thats sweet. congrats
im sure it wont take you long with that degree
That's terrible!  Were you in a bad part of town or anything?
That kind of thing always creeps me out.  Glad you made it ok!
Why is that_comma_ is there something scheduled today that you really are trying to avoid?
My first marriage was much like that_comma_ I hope you have a very calm day and no arguing.
Great job!  Did anything else come with it?
Yeah_comma_ anything is better than nothing.  Good work!
did you take it in to get fixed?
ah i understand now
I hear you! What made you feel all alone?
Oh okay! Where did they go?
What time was that?
Wow long time! Are you still at this job?
Complaint them about the product
OMG. That's unfair
You must be proud. What kind of cake did you make.
I love tres leche.  I haven't had a slice of that in forever.
Oh god. Are you ok?
We've all been embarassed at work lol. Don't even worry about it.
Did you propose her?
Oh_comma_ so sad. You may try one more time.
Oh no. What happened?!
What was the size?
Oh cool! Does he have a country club membership? What were you doing that you couldn't go?
Oh I am sorry! Bummer to miss out
Oh I bet that was so good
That is always a good feeling
AMAZING! Congrats! 
How long does film school last?
So you have two dogs? That is so nice I love dogs.
Beautiful_comma_ sounds like she is in good hands. 
they must have something against trucks
that's true and also not a good sign if a cop decides to pull you over
Is your current ceiling fan broken?
Nice_comma_ I hope you enjoy it.   Grats on the house too.
OH! I do too! They are so healthy and you can get them without any sugar too!
Oh...well you should try it without_comma_ fruit itself is already full of sugar :) If you try the ones with orange juice_comma_ they can be pretty sweet on their own.
I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ sounds like family took a trip?
I'm glad the bad times have stopped and hope your furkids can help cheer you up. I feel lonely at times too it's only human.
Oh yes they are! I love it when that happens
Lol! Cool_comma_ what kind of memory did it trigger?
Oh you are brave! I LOVE the ocean but I am terrified of being in the middle of it :)
How fast are they supposed to be going?
There's a lot of selfish people in the world_comma_ and a lot of impatient ones too. It's extremely frustrating.
did you mute it
i hate when that happens
We don't see many here. Do you live in a city?
Well_comma_ the city probably should do something about it.
What happened to make him flood things? Something overflowed?
That's too bad. Well I hope it didn't ruin anything special??
What happened? Is she undergoing it for depression or what?
So disgusting to see such irresponsible parents bringing up a child in such conditions. Hope for him to be well
That sucks.  Someone in a parking lot do  that to you?
and I bet they just drove off and didn't even leave a note.
thats cool!
it sure does feel  good that someone notices
That has to be really annoying.  Have you called animal control?
Yes_comma_ that's one way to deal with it.  What did you end up doing?
I'm sorry to hear that. Was there something going on around you that made you scared?
Wooded ares are beautiful_comma_ until you have to be alone in them_comma_ when it's dark.
What was impressive about that?
Everyone knew he was going to do it though
that sounds cool
i bet it was
That sounds like so much fun. I've actually never been to a casino but would love to.
I would feel the same way. I'm not always very lucky though so I'd be a little apprehensive at first.
I'm sure she'll be happy with whatever gift you got her.
What was it that she wanted?
Wow.  How much did they win?
Jeez_comma_ that's a lot!  I hope they can manage it ok.
you try calling for a status update?
ah it happens i guess
Pets are great companions! What kind of pet is it?
Wow I was not expecting that! I'm happy that you get to spend time with it.
Why? What's going on? Or_comma_ y'know_comma_ not going on ?
Is there something going on that's got you feeling that way?
Slippery floor_comma_ or slippery you ?
Oh_comma_ been there before. Sometimes I'm given things that make me very unsteady.
what did she do? woke up late?
ah yea mine does that.. i have a spray bottle for days like that :)
Oh no. That is gorrible
Did the person stop?
Why on earth would someone do that? A totally pointless act!
Some people will steal anything_comma_ I guess. A store employee once told me they had to keep certain things by the checkout or they walked!
It sure is! I got caught (when I was about 8) bouncing a ping pong ball while leaving a toy store. The owner took me home and my Dad gave me a hiding. Never again!
Oh yes. While other teenagers were thieving I was being a very good little girl! Hope you get a replacement for your trash can.
How'd they do?
Good for them
On your car?? Did you get it on camera?
Oh bummer! I can't stand it when people are that selfish! I wish we had CCTV cameras everywhere like they do in the UK
i bet it was!
i wouldnt even try that
What did you do?
Sounds annoying_comma_ she needs to be more careful
Oh wow like for law school? or what you take after law school?
That is really awesome! I bet is a a relief that its done now!
Oh Wow! That is awesome! I wonder who did it.
That was very kind of them.
Did you find out who did it?
Is it really bad one?
i hope so too
you can do it!
what did you get?
that does sound like fun
I would have been as well_comma_ how late was it? 
sounds super scary! my god. 
Oh lord! Why did you need to lie?
Oh ok! Well I can understand that.
aweee you got puppies? i barely sleep so i feel you
that's so sweet of you that you adopted an abused dog and taking care of her
I'm sorry to hear that. Why couldn't you go home?
That's crazy! Is it always so busy?
what did you say
oh well .. next time will be easier
That sounds crappy! When do they close? 
Sounds like a good idea! I would do the same. 
Storms can be quite scary! Is it over now?
Hopefully_comma_ that's the last storm for a while.
That's awesome! I hope it's a good paying job.
I know what you mean_comma_ I hate job searching.
What kind of pet was it
Oh that sounds scary
oh im sorry to hear that
well it sounds like it has gotten a little easier which is always good.
My cat hasn't been feeling well this past week_comma_ I think there might be something really wrong.
For the vet to see me cat.
did he pass away?
have you gotten a new pet or still too soon?
Oh no_comma_ how big is the dent?
Not too bad. Is it deep?
I bet you are a happy parent then
I guess thats all kids though
Sounds really fun do you go kayaking often? 
I bet you are going to go more often now. Kayaking is really enjoyable. 
thats awesome news! congrats
is it going to be a big wedding or small?
Why did you have to walk home alone?
That's awful. Are you ok now?
I do too! Do you feel like you are prepared?
Maybe practice with a friend or spouse! That may help you feel a little more confident.
thats good
i think you are right about that
Whats happening next week? 
Oh thats right mine arent old enough yet so I dont have that type of joy but im happy for you! ha ha 
Audis are pretty nice. You must feel a bit jealous_comma_ hu?
He might have a large monthly payment.
ah damn!! it would have been pretty embarrassing!!
She must have been shy to tell you that
Oh man_comma_ what do you think happened to it?
I've had that happen. Are you going back to get it?
How long have you been working there for? 
Kinda creepy then that you are randomly the only one there 
That's awesome. Do you workout regularly?
I should get to that as well.
That was very nice of you though
It was still a nice thing to do
Yea that can be hard sometimes. Im sure will understand.
Im sure she knows how hard you work to provide for her.
hard work pays of
keep up the good work!
Gross! Do you work in a restaurant?
That's sucks. I bet all that food smells.
Congratulations! That's getting to the point where you look at their homework and realize you forgot how difficult it was_comma_ ha.
Oh Lord_comma_ I have forgotten almost everything I learned in Algebra and beyond.
Oh wow. How long has it been since you last spoke with her?
That's awesome. I know you were happy to receive that in the mail! 
do you give them money?
yea me too
oh damn!! did you find who it was?
ah that sucks!! bad luck!!
Oh no! Did you actually see them do it? 
That is really frustrating. Were you able to claim it on your insurance? I can't imagine how frustrating that must have felt. 
I bet that was fun. Like where? A museum or something Lol
Oh wow that is surprising. Did you guys have a picnic?
that's a mess and i feel pity for you
Use thinner which is used for painting _comma_ i think that ought to do
Stay positive_comma_ you never know. Maybe send them a polite email saying thank you for the interview and things you liked about the company.
It can't hurt! Just keep on applying_comma_ even to job that are above or below your skill levels.
What were young to do with your freetime?
Oh I have always wanted to do that
what did he do to it?
oh thats cool
Nice_comma_ I'm sure you are a great uncle! It's fun to be youthful sometimes and relive childhood memories!
Yes defenitly! I see my daughter who is a toddler and love to see all that life in her!
mine started today!!
thats always good when they cant wait to return
That's always disappointing. In time for what?
Oh that's too bad. I am sure you felt bad_comma_ but your son probably understood.
Sounds like life is finally moving the right direction for you_comma_ it's great to be thankful for the simple things in life!
Yes :) people get so caught up in material things and forgot how blessed they are to have food and shelter!
Why's that? What happened?
That can be scary! There's usually nobody in the woods though luckily.
did you call the po-po ?
yea they are dumb.
wow that sounds nice
hard work pays off i guess
Great_comma_ where will you be going ?
Don't take too much money with you.
Did you find out who did it?
You should make a sign that says something about your lunch on it?
are you able to go real early before the crowds get there?
ah that makes sense
It's awesome. Hope you're getting promotions at right time.
Good for you!
Were you supposed to?
I hope they get it figured out for you. How frustrating. 
Why was he suspended_comma_ did he do something wrong?
Did it every get straightened out_comma_ that sounds pretty terrible.
What is it?
Well_comma_ that's different at least.
what do you do to get prepared
thats a smart idea
What kind of dog was it?
Was it a big one?
Why were you late
That happened to me too_comma_ I hate it
yea i also love my sister pet
yea its fun
thats cool
tell me about it.
That's good :)  Having a good family always makes life easier.
I bet!  Mine have been really great too!
That's terrible! How long did you study for it?
I bet you put a lot of effort into it. Maybe you could talk to him and plead your case to get him to reconsider.
That must've been scary_comma_ what kind of mask!
Do you plan on getting her back later?
Maybe try a freddy mask this time.
That's good to hear! How long is the vacation for?
That's not too bad. I hope you have a fun and relaxing vacation!
what kind of sub is it
ah that sounds tasty
What kinda glass?
He'll probably be upset_comma_ but I'm sure he'll come around. It was an accident.
I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ you got to check though.
What happened that lead to it?
Yay!  I love dogs!  Do you have any you want to get specifically or are you just going to look until you find one that clicks?
Congratulations!  I'm sure she's going to be super happy!
I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ did you do anything to not feel so lonely?
Ah_comma_ I see. Was it a good kind of alone then?
is that a good thing or bad thing?
oh congrats then. i hope all goes well for them!
have you gone to the doctor yet? or is it not that serious
oh ok_comma_ so it is just a  common cold then?
I'm sorry to hear that! Is it that busy at work?
Oh are you a teacher?
thats great of him to stick by her side. you dont see that anymore
thats a good story.
What did you get in debt for?
Was it worth it?
Oh wow! That's amazing. Congratulations!
Are you undergrad or grad student?
That's awesome! Life moves fast_comma_ doesn't it?
Oh so he's your little brother? You must be so proud of him.
Wow. I'd just use that as motivated to get better. I'm sure you can get to her level or exceed it with some deligence.
We can't compare ourselves to others. It'll just make you miserable. There will always be someone who is better in something. You could be better at something that someone else isn't.
oh wow.. gonna be the next bobby flay!
If you have the drive for it_comma_ im sure you will do great!
Parking lot accidents are so rampant.
Are you gonna get it repaired?
It sure did. Did you get a chance to relax and have some fun?
So am I. Would you be okay with longer work days then?
Nice friend. All of mine have been gone for decades.
Sure is_comma_ last time I saw one was some time in the 90s.
where is your trip at? why are you so exited
wow i have always wanted to go to las vegas_comma_ good luck and dont gamble all your money haha
I love package delivery days!  I've got a couple coming as well.  What are you waiting for?
Oh wow_comma_ a big package!  Hope you enjoy it!
Ouch... I'd have to admit that it would make me a tad nervous.
Absolutely! That is definitely the attitude to have. Trust is huge in making a relationship successful. It's just natural to feel a bit nervous.
hahaha you must be so proud! How long did it take you to teach him?
Man_comma_ I'd love to see that!
Dang_comma_ heartbreaking. If I were your co-worker and you told me that_comma_ I'd lend you at least a couple bucks for the vending machines or something. Hopefully you can go home and have a nice dinner.
Ah_comma_ there you go. The world isn't completely heartless. Yeah_comma_ I think the trick is to always keep that stuff with your car keys_comma_ because then you'll never forget it.
Ouch that sucks.   Honestly_comma_ if you had a crappy obamacare bronze plan its unlikely they'd pay for anything anyways.  Its always a nightmare.    You've got to spend a fair amont of cash before they cover anything but a checkup.
Yep_comma_ you'll probably be fine. Give it a couple of days. 
thats a bad feeling :/ dont be too hard on yourself 
Yeah but its a test! Its not like you cheated on your spouse or did something severe! lol 
That is always a good feeling. 
Thats the spirit. It is always exciting to start something new.
That must be so nice having that freedom.
Do you feel you could see yourself marrying her?
What is her name?
Lucky you_comma_ my girlfriend Elaine is a bit mean sometimes.
I love dogs! I bet you were so happy. 
Oh my god_comma_ I've always wanted a husky! You are so lucky. They do have beautiful eyes.
Oooh_comma_ that's exciting!  What schools did you apply for?
That's worth being nervous over.  I'm sure you'll do great!
Oh yeah what do you plan on doing? 
Sounds like a good time! 
did you have some back up clothes ?
oh that stinks
I'm sorry_comma_ that made me laugh. Never really seen a parrot speak that well before. Thought it as just something you see in movies. Does it say anything else fun?
That's... a really interesting strategy. Wonder what will happen once he actually does lose weight and doesn't want to be called fat anymore! Well_comma_ I guess to each their own.
I'm so sorry to hear that. It's hard losing someone that dear to her. I hope she opens herself up to healing.
It's gonna take some time_comma_ and I'm sure those phone calls help more than you think.
I did that 32 years ago in high school.
Right_comma_ I understand that. It's not a nice thing.
What is your wifes name?
Do you love her lots?
thats a bummer! How long ago did you lose it? 
Well I hope you find it_comma_ and a winning lotto ticket at the same time. 
Good to hear! Congrats!!
Hope you'll receive more bonus in upcoming days!!
what did you all make
that sounds tasty.
What happened?
Did you ever find him?
did he do it in a normal fashion or did he stared at you weird
you should have told someone that is how robbers usually target people
That's great! Are you trying to buy a house?
It's nice to have a place of your own. I remember the excitement I felt when I bought my house.
thats good
thats good that it wasnt major.
That's a good way to go into an interview. Did it go well?
Awesome_comma_ congrats on your new job.
I bet you can't wait. Is it a substantial raise?
That's fantastic. Congratulations! Buy yourself a little treat.
I'm glad you've found a change of pace.
Of course it is. I'd say it'll benefit each other.
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that you don't have enough money for food_comma_ but stealing isn't the answer! Maybe there's a local food bank you can contact.
Call your local support services. Usually it's 211. They can put you in contact with charities_comma_ churches and other organizations who can help you! I wish you the best!
Did you ask him to wash the dishes?
You should do to him a strong amount of punishment!
Oh no_comma_ is your dog okay?
I hope your dog is found safe!
sounds like fun
i hope it goes well!
That is fantastic. Anything new going on?
I wish I was that content with my life. I have too many changes going on right now.
I bet it did. I would love to listen to my old cds
What a fun way to reminisce. 
Yeah_comma_ you're right. are you in reunion now?
It's very hard to leave. But the memories will always cheer with us. 
Did you prepare for it?
It's not too late. You will have to pull an all nighter and study. If you are prepared you will feel better about going.
Are you going to get another?
Probably best to also take time to process what happened
Amazing! How old is he?
Good on him! For what it's worth I'm super proud of him! 
That must be annoying_comma_ what kind of dog?
Maybe try asking the neighbor about him?
Oh no_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of test was it?
Calculus seems like very hard stuff for anyone. Don't feel too down. Just use this as motivation to study more!
That's the spirit! Never quit and give up. Everyone fails sometimes.
Do you have a rather large family?
Will you have music and dance?
Are you excited about it?
Maybe you should confront them about it.
Heck yeah. Tackle the issue head on! Maybe it'll workout and they'll try to be nicer.
Aw_comma_ thanks. I hope it all works out for you. Have a great day!
Oh no what happened? Why don't you think you did well?
I hope its better than you expect!
Ooh that is rough having to prepare for. How do you think you did?
That's awesome! I'm so glad to hear that! Hopefully this boosts your confidence for next time_comma_ now you know you can do it.
oh its really frustrating and not fair
ok don't feel bad be happy and search for your future behalf
Warcraft - that's an online role play game_comma_ right?
I'm afraid I avoid those games - too addictive. I'd never get anything else done! Presumably you play.
Hmm. Perhaps I should have a look then. I just have such an addictive personality - Hopeless!
Oh_comma_ there are plenty of those_comma_ believe me_comma_ lol. At least you enjoy it tho'. That's good.
not really
I know_comma_ is it like when I got my new car?
A ford mustang I always like muscle cars!
Pontiac makes good cars. But more importantly your wardrobe mishap is a little funny_comma_ sorry. Hope everything worked out.
That's awesome! Did you get a good deal?
Some people enjoy fixing things. That will be fun if you're ready for it. What kind of car did you get?
Not me. I'd be walking if i did. 
YouTube makes things so much easier to learn. 
Oh no!  What happened?
Oh jeeze. Did they catch them on film?  Hopefully insurance will take care of it.
won the lottery?
well thats good too!
I love animals! What kind of pet does she have?
Oh wow_comma_ that's unusual. 
uh oh! Have you checked your sugar lately?
After that bag of candy_comma_ you may want to!
I'm jealous of you. I'm a little introverted and antisocial_comma_ and never got good at developing friendships where I could make them long-lasting and trustworthy. Good for you
Yeah_comma_ since I've been in college_comma_ I've been forced to socialize more and I'm getting better at it. It's a muscle just like anything else I guess_comma_ and you have to "work it out." 
That's great! Anything helps as you said_comma_ keep trying for more!
We certainly need to do better as a country to make higher education more affordable.
Oh_comma_ what kind of relationship is it?
Yikes_comma_ stop the relationship at all cost!
Are you happy for her?
Well if you treat her right she won't go any where. 
Oh yea? Is it for higher pay or just needing a different scenery?
Is the new city have a higher cost of living?
I feel you man.  I'm off in 1 hour and 11 minutes.  tick tock.
Its a small world... maybe we even work at the same place.
Oh god_comma_ I think we've all gone through that. Did you have nice undies on though?
Oh that's not too bad then!
It's pretty good! Hope you had a good time!
Sure. Visit again and suggest your friends too.
Oh boy! Is it yours?
I love puppies. What kind of breed is it?
Have you tried driving around and looking for it? Or calling the neighbors for help? Maybe they have seen it.
I hope they are able to locate him! Check to see if your friend had it microchipped.
It is tough! Do you have family nearby?
That would be hard. 
Cool. Girl or boy?
Are yo going to spoil him?
I know what you mean lol
Oh boy_comma_ what are you going to do?  Do you have a good bus system you can use?
I hear you!  I hate physical activity that seems unnecessary. 
HAHAHAHAHA.  I love that plan!
Oh goodness! That is terrible to hear! Have you contacted someone to help clean it up? That can easily cause mold.
Try seeing if your insurance with cover it. If not grab a shop vac or 2! They are great at sucking up water out of tight spaces
That's a bummer.  Did you make her chicken noodle soup
That's good she's got a nurturing / caring mom_comma_ I know some pretty bad parents out there
They never learn_comma_ do they ?
Oh well_comma_ we tried didn't we.
That's so nice of you to be supportive to your friend through struggles.  Is it a long time struggle or something sudden?
That's awful.  Its so good they have someone like you who is there for them when they need you most.
Oh well_comma_ you will get it clean
I guess try and get those done first
Congratulations! I bet you're happy.
I'm super happy for you! You'll do great.
That is great_comma_ what kind of dancer is she?
I'm impressed_comma_ where did she win the medal?
That's awful. Is she alright now?
Hope she will be fine soon!
That is pretty unsettling.  Whereabouts do you live
I used to live close to North Minneapolis and I would always hear people fighting in the streets and every once in a while a gunshot.  Got pretty desensitized to it though
What is a clean fade
Oh it sounds kind of cool
That's a shame. What is it that prevents you from getting them done?
Financial constraints are definitely a good reason. Maybe one of your friends could help you out.
Cool Do they have tournaments?
Do you play too?
Me either lol. I wold be a good water boy lol
Thats some really good progress right there
I guess that could make you regret even the things you never thought og
What was the basic jist of what they were saying?
That's something I personally struggle with. I never feel like I have enough money to hand out_comma_ but there's many people worse off than me who could use it.
That is amazing_comma_ what level is the team?
That is even more impressive!  I know they take hockey seriously up there_comma_ so your friend must be pretty darn good.
I hope he does.  It would be good to have a friend in the NHL!
You must be some proud of that.
Do you think she has a future in music?
Nice were they guy friends or girl friends
Why did you feel cocky...did you talk to any hotties at the bar or what
Oh_comma_ how do they go for that?
Do they like you doing that?
I do not believe that
I hate when that happens_comma_ did you try to get a refund?
Well_comma_ hopefully they get it resolved. Does not help your lunch today however.
I don't blame you!  I would've been furious if some girl was talking to my husband that way.  Ridulous how awful some people are.
Ha ha_comma_ that's a good one.  
I would hate that. Luckily my dog makes enough noise for 5! My kids are grown and gone_comma_ too.
Pit/wolf hybrid. She helps so much.
gosh that is horrible! Did you try to call the company? next time chooe a company that guarantees they will come or the service is free
oh yes_comma_ i understand_comma_ i had no choice either. there is only one provider in my area
I'm dealing with the same thing right now! I had to teach her how to parralel park yesterday! It is terrifying! 
You can take her to the DMV when they are closed! They will allow you to use there set up to help.
I'm so sorry to hear that. How long has it been if I may ask?
I am very sure he was proud of you_comma_ and cherished every moment he could spend with you while he was alive.
That sounds like a fun event
I am sure you will get it soon as well
That's more rare than diamonds.  You'd better hold on to him
Awesome.  Can I get his number ;)
There is no better feeling than getting off of work!
Maybe you can knock off 43 minutes early.
That is the worst!
That's too bad. What age is he?
Oh no! Does he have the option of taking it again?
Oh no! I would have a heart attack! Are you able to take time away from life so unexpectedly to spend time with them?
hahaha I would have been like a mad woman trying to clean too! I hope it works out and your husband can take time off!
Have you thought about cutting it down?
Sounds pretty creepy
Impressive_comma_ what do you plan to do with the degree?
Cool_comma_ I hope you find success_comma_ and that your hard work pays off. 
That's the worst_comma_ what did you eat then?
Oh no! You should try to find the culprit and confront them
Hahahahaha.  I'm sorry for laughing_comma_ but that struck me as funny.  Is he trying his best_comma_ or is he trying to get the point across that he shouldn't be cooking?
That might be a good Christmas present.  You could do it as a couple.  I did one of those with my wife last year and it was a blast.
I hear those wildfires are getting really bad. I hope they don't affect you too badly.
Drive safe! I really hope they can get those wildfires under control soon. 
Oh_comma_ I'm so excited for you! I hope you get a raise too!
Me too! As long as it's not bad news right?
That would be hard_comma_ can one work independently? 
I'm sure you are doing an amazing job_comma_ you seem to care which makes you a great parent.
I am sorry to hear that_comma_ what did you dog do to make you angry?
I hate to hear that_comma_ hopefully you were able to get your garden lined out.
Oh my goodness_comma_ that must have been humiliating.  What did you do?
Did it happen after you got out of the pool?
I am so sorry that happened to you.
Oh my gosh_comma_ that's the dream haha. What did you eat the most of?
Wow_comma_ that's dedication. I guess those plates add up. That's not a very nice policy for a restaurant to have.
Awesome_comma_ what was it for?
Be grateful. Most people don't have a team to make them look good by comparison.
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth ;D
hahaha.   Kids are wonderful. 
Well that's wonderful that you had a supporting aunt like that. How do you think you did on your test?
Well_comma_ I'm real glad for you! You should make your aunt a pie or something sometime.
haha..yeah it is kid of pointless but it is a little fun as a kid. im sure your son will remember 
i agree. i remember a lot of obscure things that my parents are surprised i remember.
Excellent! Which beach?
I'm jealous.
where are you guys going? 
that's awesome! how long are you staying there? i'm sure you will enjoy your time. i went to mississippi a couple of months ago to see my family_comma_ it was so awesome
Do you sleep better when it rains too?
Oh well at least you get to listen to it now
Oh no! Have you tried the old "put it in a bag of rice" trick?
Give it a few days (even though it feels like a million). I'll cross my fingers for you! I'm so sorry_comma_ that is a huge bummer!
oh no! i'm sorry to hear that. I wish i could come over and help you clean up
that's good. what are you having for dinner?
Oof_comma_ are you sure you don't want to try a half marathon first? You'll need to train quite a bit before doing a full marathon
Oh! Well then stay hydrated! I hope you do well!
Don't worry. Soon you'll get good friends.
Yeah_comma_ you should explore it!
glad to hear that. im guessing you have studied hard?
congratulations!! im glad to hear that. was the exam hard?
Oh no that is terrible. Is there anyone near you that could be of help? Maybe a family member or someone that can lend a hand or ear? I'm so sorry to hear this.
I know it means swallowing some pride_comma_ but if it's financial help you need_comma_ perhaps you could go the route of Gofundme? or maybe government services? I know it might be embarrassing to some people_comma_ but sometimes your back is against the wall you have nothing to lose.
I'm happy that you got a new turkey friar and fried your first turkey. You do seem like you would enjoy that. 
Hey_comma_ some people are on this planet to fry birds_comma_ and some people aren't. I guess that's just how it is.
I understand how you feel.  My sister struggled to get pregnant. She did invitro twice.   
The first one didn't work. Apparently the second one did.... but that's supposed to be a secret for now.  She's supposed to surprise me and my father with shirts....  my mom is a loud mouth and spilled the beans though.
Yeah.  Apparently she's just as bad as my sisters's Mother in law.  She spent a good amount of time complaining about it.
Sounds wonderful!  Nothing better than putting your feet up at the end of the day.  Think you might watch some tv?
Hope you have an enjoyable evening and relaxing sleep!  Love me some tv too!  I'm watch Great Food Truck Race tonight!
Oh no! I'm sure it was awful at the time_comma_ but it'll be a good story when he grows up!
That is too funny. They'll grow out of it soon enough!
That sucks. What type of team?
I'm sorry.
That's amazing_comma_ how old is your son these days?
That's nice that you can share things like that_comma_ it seems like your family is very close!
That sounds risky but at the same time if it works out convenient! 
I am sure it will be fine!  It's not like you don't know where they live haha
I've never cried at work_comma_ but I've wanted to lol.
Yeah they can be. But_comma_ sometimes you just got to tough it out.
You're doing good.
Lovely. I too love pets.
Where did they go?
Oh that's nice_comma_ you guys get to throw a party if you want haha
I bet you'll do great.  I would be nervous too.  Hopefully it won't be anything too serious and more cut and dry decision.  Have you gone before?
i have never been before since I was either very ill or had babies/kids.  Good luck and don't stress too much. You'll be great!
I hate when they do that. They make it so hard to pay for
They sound like a shady hospital to me
Oh boy. I know just how you feel. Could you persuade them to go to a restaurant?
Good for you! I'd be so busy yelling at my husband I'd forget to cook_comma_ lol. Do you know them well?
Well_comma_ that's at least something! It's when he decides to invite the boss and his wife over when you'd decided dinner was mac n' cheese - that's when it gets hairy!
That would be scary! Were you able to catch her?
That's good_comma_ there is nothing scarier than a fur baby missing!
Wow_comma_ thats so cool! I wish i could rock climb.
I can understand that. I have MS so I'm no stranger to autoimmune diseases.
Why did you lie to her?
Oh_comma_ well you a very naughty person.
That would be tough. I think I was one of the last one's not required to take foreign language.
I wish you the best in dealing with this.
I hear you on that. I'm visiting my girlfriend_comma_ but she still has to work_comma_ so the weekend is really the only time we can hang out. Do you have any special plans?
That's a good idea. We actually did that last weekend. I guess it makes sense to do that as much as you can before summer is over. I hope you have a nice time!
Oh my gosh_comma_ I feel the same to be honest. I hate_comma_ hate talking in front of a crowd.
I'm sure you'll be fine_comma_ just try to practice as much as possible beforehand
I'm sorry_comma_ but that made me laugh a little bit. I've never been able to get into the idea of cats as pets just because they're so independent and determined to do whatever the want. Doesn't seem like they can listen to any direction you try to give them.
Yeah_comma_ it works for some people. I'm glad it works for you. I like my pets to be a little more needy and affectionate_comma_ but sometimes sassy can be really fun and keep things interesting and lively.
That sounds exciting - where are you going!?
I love the beach_comma_ being on the Gulf Coast is probably my favorite.  I hope you have a great time!
Have you been reading reviews online?
Whoa. That sounds like a very nice computer. What a surprise. That should work out pretty well.
Hey! Good luck to you! That's got to be tough! 
For what it's worth I'm proud of you! 
That is a pretty big decision to make. Did she spring this up on you or was this something you knew she'd eventually want?
I hope you can figure out a way to make things work out! Sounds like you're stuck between a rock and a hard place.
That profession takes a lot of courage and a unique set of skills and personality. That's pretty cool that you took that route--sometimes I think about the "what if" of if I took that route. Pretty sure most people have that fantasy_comma_ but only the people brave enough actually go on the path to do it_comma_ like you
Well_comma_ at the very least_comma_ from the little that you've said_comma_ you seem very self-aware. That's a very underrated trait for people to have and to develop.. so whatever it is you decide_comma_ it seems like you'll be efficient at seeing it through. Good luck!
Ooh_comma_ that's awesome. It's great when you can spend a little extra on the fun things.
Congratulations_comma_ I'm glad to hear you've been able to accomplish that for yourself. :)
I always wished I could do that with my dad. But he had a stroke in his 40s_comma_ and was never in good enough health to do it with me. That and I was kind of shy and introverted_comma_ so I never made friends to do it with_comma_ either. It stinks to miss the memories_comma_ but I'm glad to hear you got to have them
Maybe you can look forward to using it as motivation to doing those sorts of things with your kids in the future_comma_ if you choose to have them? 
Just try and drive carefully then. Maybe the weather will change by then
I am sure you will make it
Fantastic_comma_ was it a lot ?
Put it to some good use.
Do you feel better now.
Yeah. It happens to everyone whenever whether changes.
Have you been studying?
Good luck_comma_ and I'm sure if you prepared well and studied hard_comma_ you'll do great!
That's no good_comma_ what made you smoke?
Definitely_comma_ maybe some exercise and relaxation instead?
I'm an animal lover myself. I have a cat who just had four kittens. They're adorable!
Well that's very kind of you to help them out.
That's terrifying_comma_ are you okay?
Thankful that no one was hurt_comma_ did you call the police?
Ah_comma_ dang_comma_ did he know you were trying to buy it also?
Well_comma_ maybe you can set a deal up with him and you can share it!
well you can improvise and make everyday household items into a gym that work just a well!
yes. youtube will def have some awesome ideas . i could stand to get rid of this gut also..hahahah
Oh wow! That sounds scary! I'd be mad!
How annoying! That sucks.
Oi...I don't like doctors or the dentists.
lol! I do not blame you_comma_ did you look up reviews?
That is a stress we all go through! It's hard!
Oh no! You don't have family?
Aw_comma_ I love puppers! What kind is it?
Aw_comma_ I'm happy for you_comma_ they are really a joy and can make your life happier!
Oh nice! Tell me about the new school?
Oh thank goodness. That common core is ridiculous.
Fresh socks are a treat for the feet!
What does he do?
lol! My mom used to do that with books_comma_ she would read the ending first.
Nope she still reads it all. Same thing you do silly! lol
Oh that's great! I got my cat a new bed and she won't touch it
That's so nice of you to do that for her. I have two dogs and they're picky too.
Aww_comma_ I can see how that might make you feel really bad. Was it replaceable?
That's a real bummer. On the bright side_comma_ it taught your son that sometimes accidents happen and that's OK.
oh no! that is horrible and those things always seem to happen when on your way to work or somewhere important
wow that is a really expensive tire!!
Woohoo! That sounds like it'll be a blast to drive!
Just make sure you drive safely! :)
I bet that was exciting to watch
I am sure he got some things from you
Ah_comma_ I'm sorry_comma_ well you can redeem your family and be a good influence to your community!
I bet you're a great person and don't worry about the past!
A good feeling about the weather?
Oh how neat!  I guess you must have sensed it!
That's neat!  Where did you go?
Oh that sounds exciting!  I've never had the chance to go to one.
Maybe she will go easy on you_comma_ if this isn't something you do often. 
You shouldn't steal things_comma_ especially non essential things like toys. But you probably know that.
Wow_comma_ what did you do?
It is what I thought. You did good.
you should probably talk to that co worker and if it doesn't stop i would report it to the HR
I don't think you would make any problems. who knows maybe he is a pervert
Oh no!  What happened?
I am sorry to hear that.  Hopefully at least he is making progress
That's a wonderful thing to do. What kind of tasks do you do there?
I'm sure they appreciate having people to talk to who don't judge them negatively. We have a little "tent city" in our neighborhood and it was just announced that they're going to be removed. That makes me sad because there is a lack of shelters.
People think that people bring it on themselves_comma_ so many have a hard time sympathizing.
Temporary teeth? How long do those last?
Ah yeah_comma_ that was a pretty good idea then. Hopefully she can get some permanent ones soon!
Yikes. That is incredibly expensive for one tooth.
Awesome! Congratulations! I'm sure you earned it.
It's good that they appreciate you and are kind enough to reward you for your efforts!
You're gonna miss the launch. What are you doing on here?
Have you been playing for a long time?
I've been playing since 2006.
I hate to hear that. Did the person that got the job deserve it?
Well_comma_ I have faith that you will find something just as good_comma_ keep your head up and keep trying.
Where are you going? Are you scared of going on the plane or going to a new place?
I'm sure you'll have a blast_comma_ I've heard it's beautiful continent. And the food will be great!
Maybe if you search some more it will go on sale. But if you really like it you should get it.
Just think how happy it will make you feel each time you wear it.
Ohhh I've been checking it out too!  What side are you going with?
Lok'tar ogar! I love my undead necromancer! What race/class will you go with for Alliance?
Oh man. That sucks. NY is really fun. Why couldn't you go?
I would be kind of mad and dissappointed with him. You could have offered to pay your own way!
That's pretty cool! Was it a professional game?
Sounds like he's a good player! You should ask him for some tickets!
Aw man. I am guessing you already went to the store. Did you have to interact with the manager?
Yeah that stinks. Is it a store you go often?
Congrats! I am also working hard at getting super fit too at 35! It is harder the older you are but totally doable if you're committed!
So true! Building muscle is great!
Oh no_comma_ he's probably lost. Maybe you should take him in and feed him.
At least you're concerned and interested in helping. Some people would ignore the poor little kitty and just let him die. Very kind of you!
If I had a huge yard_comma_ I'd probably have an entire farm house from all the stray animals I see and feel bad for! I can't help myself.
That's awesome. Would have been a bummer to come home to a messy house.
Well it's good that you have such a great wife! I hope you guys have an amazing life together.
Congratulations_comma_ I'm sure you will do great.  it's always nerve-racking the first day of work!
Good luck_comma_ and have fun.  The money will just be a bonus!
Why'd you turn her down?
Well_comma_ props on you for being loyal. That shows a lot of character.
I did actually.
I'm not even sure_comma_ maybe they had a deal in place with the school board?
What kind of job is it?
Sounds like a promising job
I know. I just went yesterday!
I can't wait to move and have a hook up.
Nice_comma_ that's very convenient_comma_ do you enjoy it? 
Haha_comma_ she doesn't understand that you're at work!
Mmmm_comma_ I love gourmet ice cream.  If I didn't have self control I would be like 800 pounds from it.
You and me both_comma_ we need to hit the gym!
I love video games too_comma_ what's your favorite. I really like "Don't Starve" by Klei.
Oooh my friends have been playing that_comma_ maybe I should get it too
Oh no_comma_ that must have been pretty awful. Do you not have self checkout at your grocery store?
If it makes you feel any better_comma_ I bet that happens a lot to the cashier. They probably didn't think twice or care as long as you weren't a jerk.
I deal with anxiety myself_comma_ so I know not thinking about it is easier said than done. Take care of yourself and try to find a good distraction to get your mind off it!
How are they? Are you doing pretty well in that area?
That is awesome! Sounds like they are finely horned then! 
Fantastic! Being grateful is the way to be happy!
Me too! It's good when you have caring people around.
I love dogs_comma_ what kind of puppy is it?
I have a pit myself_comma_ they are great dogs despite what people say about them
Yea_comma_ I enjoy stuff from my childhood. What kind of music are you listening to_comma_ country_comma_ rock_comma_ something else?
That sounds like a really great time_comma_ I love those nostalgic feelings you get from listening to stuff from your past.
I bet! Who do you think it's going to have the most separation anxiety_comma_ you or them? Be honest!
Well stay strong! For what it's worth_comma_ I moved schools a lot as a kid and yeah the first day is rough but kids adapt quickly. They might even make new friends right away!
That's terrible that you are being abused. Who is treating you so poorly?
If you guys are in an exclusive relationship_comma_ then that would be considered infidelity. You should leave her and focus on yourself.
Are you excited about it?
Whats new in the game?
   Some people have no respect for otheres.
Are they like 1000 level classes?  If I was in a higher class I'd of straight told them to quiet down.
Yeah you've still got some riff raff around at that level.  Man... its been a long time but_comma_ I remember those days.
You should.  I ran out of patience for that stuff real fast.
Thats sick. Did you report them? They are supposed to have them cleaned several times per day or they can be shut down
I would as that is a serious health hazard
End of summer cleaning_comma_ I know that feeling_comma_ got to get ready for the school year!
Ah_comma_ I can imagine_comma_ Winter's are brutal there I hear.
What do you have to speak on?
My knees get weak when I try to publicly speak_comma_ it's bad.
That's nice_comma_ what kind of shoes are they? Heels?
How fun! I love shoes_comma_ I have at least 20 or 30 pairs in the house
Wow_comma_ I hope you do get a nice bonus. Sounds like you work pretty hard.
Well_comma_ Ill keep my fingers crossed for you.
That is so awesome. Congratulations. Any big plans to celebrate?
That is very exciting. 
Ugh_comma_ that is so frustrating!
That is infuriating. I know how costly healthcare is. Such a shame that we as a country cant do better.
Oh god..I don't know how you military wives do it. I just can't imagine
I would be the same. I am a one person kind of gal. I don't do that even when I am single. The worry though must be hard!
That sounds so sweet.  What was the occasion?
I would be jealous of their strong love for one another.
Where are they headed?
Some free time to yourself! Maybe you can catch up on some guilty pleasures haha
lol! I bet_comma_ how old are they?
Ohhh! Those times are nice. I only have a partner but I know I love my quiet mornings and my morning routine :)
Aw_comma_ that's cute_comma_ how old is he/she?
Oh wow_comma_ that's adorable.  I'm sure its very fragile and cute_comma_ wish I could see it!
That sucks_comma_ do you plan on getting a new one?
You should_comma_ my Ipad has great charge time.
That's always a good feeling.  If you don't feel confident going in_comma_ you're in trouble!
Ahhh_comma_ Calculus_comma_ I had a pretty hard time with that as well_comma_ some how I got a B and to be honest_comma_ I don't even know it.
Aww_comma_ that's sad. I love any and all animals_comma_ I'm sorry
It can be tough losing a pet_comma_ keep your head up
Are you going to keep them
That does sound very frustrating
Oh how did it go?
Oh nice_comma_ what was the person like?
What movie did you end up watching?
Jennifer Lawrence is one of my favorite actors_comma_ would you recommend it?
Oh nice! Where did you buy it?
Sounds like you're looking real sharp :)
What does she like to eat?
Well that is step in the right direction at least
I'm sorry to hear that. Were you close?
At least_comma_ bonds that tight mean they will always be a part of you someway. 
It is nice to enjoy life 
I am glad you are happy_comma_ its a great feeling to have
That is terrible_comma_ I am sorry for your loss...
I understand that completely
What team?
Well I wish you the best of luck!
What is her name?
That's awesome I'm happy for you. What is she like?
Awh_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any friends at school? 
Well_comma_ hopefully y'all will still be able to keep in touch.
You must be so proud_comma_ when did you find out?
Wow amazing! Do you enjoy motherhood?
Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Did you tell her?
Mistakes happen. I'm sure everyone has broken something that belongs to someone else at some point in their lives!
Awe.. I'm sorry.   I know how you must feel. I've got a dog myself.
Attleast the suffering is over.
Are you going to get another doggo?
Time heals all wounds.
How did it go?
What is the job?
You must be excited_comma_ what kind of work will you do?
That is for sure_comma_ but that should be cool_comma_ how much does it cost?
That is not too bad I would do it for that
That must have been quite lonely.  How are you doing now?
That is good.  Hopefully things keep getting better in the future.
Congratulations! I hope you do_comma_ it's always nerve-racking when it comes to the interview and whether or not your get it.
You got this! I have faith_comma_ and sending positive vibes your way!
Why did you move into  that apartment complex then?
Yikes. Just don't go wantering around at night and keep your doors locke.d
Are you saying that a drunk guy hit your car_comma_ and that it is very bad? If so_comma_ that really sucks and I am sorry. Did he have insurance?
Were the police able to help? That sounds like a big mess!
Did you find anything interesting?
Good luck. When are they supposed to reply?
Oh wow thats great_comma_ how do you like it so far?
Gosh_comma_ that's too bad! Maybe continue to work there but looks apply for new jobs. Good Luck!
What might be wrong?
I hope everything comes back clean for you?
I'm not too familiar with football_comma_ who is their star player?
Interesting_comma_ maybe I'll check them out this season
Who is coming?
Oh_comma_ well that should be a lot of fun!
What are you happy about
Those are all important things in life
It sounds like you were very prepared!! Good job!
Yes you did_comma_ it will definitely pay off!
I guess it can be a learning experience
No its not fair at all
The whole week?
Cool. Are you gona go anywhere special...

that sounds like a good plan
Cats can be odd creatures
They do. I have one and he is a great companion
Yeah_comma_ summer is a great season_comma_ have you been on vacation at all?
That's great! I went on a nice trip too
Oh_comma_ that was very nice
I like to do that for people when they don't expect it or when they need it most
Careful. Lightning never strikes twice.
In any case_comma_ good luck!
That is awesome_comma_ enjoy the peace and quiet!
I am sure you have haha
How drunk was he?
Oh_comma_ yeah I get it though_comma_ you do not get paid to babysit
Was it an accident
It was just an accident. There will always be another tv
Me too! This heat is unbearable! What is your favorite thing about fall?
I cannot wait to sit on the porch with hot chocolate with the cool breeze coming through! Just a few more months!
what was it
oh thats cool
Oh no_comma_ did you get it back
Oh no_comma_ I am sorry. Maybe he will come back
Did you have someone come in to spray it? You can ask for a refund maybe
Oh that's a good idea. What kind of bugs do you have?
I have been there. It can be irritating
Maybe you will get it next year
check out some vids on youtube. im sure you will be fine!
oh yea i can understand that
That most have been really nice. What did you do?
That sounds like it was a really good time!
Good for you!  I know that can be difficult_comma_ but it will pay off in the end
That's really something to be proud of.  Keep it up!
Congratulations. What a wonderful achievement. If I could do it all over again_comma_ this is what I'd want to do too.
Don't look back. Go forth_comma_ and be brave.
what did you do with them?
ah thats always nice to do every once in a while.
Some jerk ding your car in the parking lot?
... and i bet they didn't even leave a note or anything.
It sounds like you had a really good time!
It's always a good place to be when you are content.
Those guys and girls tend to work hard
Its nice to find good work out there
Thats great! How did you do it?
Soda definitely can make you pack on some pounds! Keep up the healthy lifestyle!
I hope your okay! Do you think you have food poising?
Oh I see_comma_ make sure to look at expriatian date next time :)
I'm so sorry to hear that_comma_ it's always tough to lose a pet. 
Oh wow_comma_ that must be tough. I'd like to think they were having trouble dealing with it themselves and that's why they didn't tell you right away.
What is in Asheville?
Oh that sounds very fun.
What kind of cereal was it
Well that sounds disgusting
That is horrible.  Is it still under warranty or anything like that?
That is a rip off honestly!  I don't think I'd buy that brand again.
I can imagine you do. Do you have a needle fear? Even if you dont they still hurt
Oh wow I would be mad. Is there any other provider who could get you in faster? 
Congratulations on working up the nerve to fly! Did you enjoy the flight?
That's awesome! It's always nice to overcome a fear!
 Are you going to ride roller coasters
I do agree with you
Oh that's awful. Did it happen in a parking lot maybe?
That's the worst and it has happened to me before too. Hopefully it's not too big of a dent.
did you all have some drinks together
thats cool
That's really great that you have an amazing partner like him!
That's great! I hope you two have a great life.
what kind of dog whas Rusty?
that is awesome. we all deserve to have an amazing dog as a kid
i'm sorry he is no longer with you but at least you have great memories of him
did you get a suprise party?
oh yea thats always nice.
I bet you were_comma_ but I am sure you had a good reason.
That's too bad. I am sure your son understood though.
I have the same tub sitting in the attic. I have no idea what to do with all the photos! Are you creating collages or albums?
awwww I would probably cry too! Scanning them seems like it would take forever. Maybe see if there is a company you can send them to and they'll do it for you.
too hot outside?
yea yes that is a nice time of the year
Where were you coming from?...and how cheap was it?
That's a steal.
what was it ? lightening perhaps
you must have some crystal clear windows 
That's tough_comma_ is there anyone else there that can help you?
Wow that sounds really physically demanding_comma_ you must be quite strong.
Oh yuck! I hate flies. 
Haha what was the drink? 
It's never too late for some late summer cleaning!
Sounds like it.  Are you going to sleep better tonight knowing its clean?
Good to hear :)
I love to play videogames. What did you play?
That is a very good game
How come? Do you not live with them anymore?
Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.
Wow that's awesome! Any special reason why?
Congratulations on that! It's a great feeling for sure.
I hope everything goes well but I'm sure it will. Don't worry.
Well stress will cause more health problems_comma_ just keep that in mind when you start to worry.
I hope it goes well_comma_ are you sick?
Oh wow_comma_ hopefully you can get some answers to ease your mind.
oh yea sounds like a great time of the year
go play bingo!
Oh no_comma_ what happened?
That is definitely scary. What happened next?
That's funny_comma_ I was thinking almost the same thing.
It's a shame that the present never seems capable of competing with the past.
What do you think about
Those are nice memories
That's how many cups of coffee I had this morning! Did you have coffee too?
Oh_comma_ yeah that does start next month! I guess I know what my husband will be doing on Sundays hahaha
What breed is it?
Sounds like a plan_comma_ I hope she is around for years to come
That is precious_comma_ animals are something special_comma_ that is for sure
Are you a big Eagles fan?
Are you a big Eagles fan?
What is a lathe_comma_ I am not familiar with it
Oh okay_comma_ that is interesting_comma_ I will need to look into that_comma_ sounds awesome to me!
Are you a big eagles fan?
Haha! I lived in Alabama until recently so professional football is something I'm distant from.
There's nothing worse! What was wrong with it?
Did you take it to a shop?
Did you have to miss work?
Oh no_comma_ that does sound so gross
Yeah it needs to be clean in there for sure
I've never seen them. What do you love about them?
Hmm I may have to check them out then! 
Wow_comma_ congrats to them. Are you worried you will loose your roommate? 
Can you afford it?
That sound like it was a bit rash.
Yeah_comma_ but now they're looking for him instead of the real crook.
i dont have kids _comma_ but i feel the same way u do if i had kids that is
thats the way it should be _comma_ they are the future
did you enjoy it?
ah well at least you didnt feel lonely
Was anything missing?
Oh no_comma_ are they okay
It's okay. There's always Wednesday service or online sermons you can watch.
I wouldn't feel so bad about missing one day!
i don't know if i could make it thru a scary movie. it gets me too scared.
i can't imagine even trying to deal. you are braver than i am for sure.
I hope everything goes well for you.
Good luck and try to think about something else before then.
I have seen the previews. Is it good?
Murder can be interesting I guess
What were you expecting?
it almost rained on me when I was walking home today.
That's unfortunate.  You must have been lonely.  Has your situation improved since then?
Wow.. that's... sad.
Can you go back and get it ?
Might be worth it_comma_ rather than someone else picking it up.
WHAT_comma_ did you catch them?
damn you should have hunted them down
It might have been the same person! We should stake out in the bushes out there and see who it was!
We'll get Taco Bell and eat tacos all night and when we catch them we'll make them watch us eat the tacos and not share with them. 
Oh nice! What was the occasion?
Happy birthday! Did you have fun at your party?
What did you do?
Oh wow_comma_ do you have a backup job lined up?
thats awesome
3rd time the charm?
Some people know they can do better so they shop around I guess.
I guess. Or it could be they are ready to move on but need to know someone else will be interested in them.
I would have screamed!
When a cockroach comes in my house_comma_ the neighborhood knows it.
Oh yeah I can see how it could be lonely. It's so quiet when they are gone.
Yeah it is like an imbalance in the house somehow.
What happened?
I don't do haunted houses lol
I would have dies
Are you proud of her?
What is she most talented at in school?
Never fun when someone tried to change your schedule. Life's unfair sometimes.
Well hopefully you were able to get some overtime pay.
I hate it. I want it to be 100 and humid all the time. I thrive in the heat
Disconnect from what? Did you have a bad day?
Nice_comma_ how much do you bench?
I see_comma_  how many years have you been playing football/what kind of goals do you have?
What did you get in the mail?
That's so cool_comma_ what is his name?
whats the dogs name ? what kind is it
oh those are nice loyal dogs.
What are they getting treatment for
I hope you guys get through it
Just say some prayers and be positive
What did they help them with_comma_ just how to do certain moves?
Yes_comma_ some are really good at helping others lose weight and feel good
That is very kind. Now many people like that.
You will have to return the favor sometime. 
Do you usually sleep in? I heard it's better to wake up naturally.
Well maybe you will be able to start a new habit of waking up without it.
I sure do! What are some of your favorites?
Oh yeah those will do that. I still have like 40 of them on VCR or video cassette_comma_ whatever those things were called. i doubt I would be able to find one these days that would actually play them@
How did you guys end up meeting?
That makes sense_comma_ when did you first meet up in person?
what did you see?
i hear that movie is great
That would be a dream
That is a place I have always wanted to go to
What happened to him ?
Was he in a dangerous area ?
thats great to hear_comma_ im happy for you and your accomplishements 
hope your future is bright 
That's great! Good for you!
That must feel really good. I bet your parents are proud!
Why is that?
What is her name_comma_ you seem so lucky.
Oh that's always tough_comma_ are you nervous?
I can understand_comma_ if you try to think positively it might help
When will it be released? I have not heard of that one.
I am sure you will have a lot of fun when it comes out.
Have you checked your lease agreement_comma_ they may be required by law to follow through.
Yeah_comma_ I would show up at the office and show them exactly where they promised to take care of you. That should work.
I'm sorry but I'm so not a fan of meatloaf. Do you have a good recipe?
Hmm that might actually be good_comma_ I think it's the ketchup that I don't like about meatloaf. Bon appetit!
Why were you scared?
Did you sneak away from them?
who did she beat down?
oh_comma_ lay the smack down     
yeah that's a bad habit. I don't like it either.
lol_comma_ he is just like my brother. You should ignore him_comma_ just like I ignore my borther
That's impressive_comma_ how did you do?
I don't think I could do it.
I keep forgetting that football season is right around the corner. Did you play when you were younger?
Spending time with your parents and watching games can create great memories! 
Really? Why is that?
Wow... I kinda hope they get fired. Why did you need to talk to the landlord?
Are you okay with that
Have you talked to her about it
Awh_comma_ I'm sorry. What happened?
Well at least you know what to do next time. I'm sure you'll rock it then!
What church do you go to?
I haven't been lately_comma_ did you do a confession?
What hate did he get
Oh I do not like them
That's awesome that you were so prepared!
I hope that you get rewarded for you hard work!
Oh no_comma_ those are so gross
That is never a good thing
What did he do?
That's so awful_comma_ what is your dogs name?
oh yea?
what ended up happening
How long have you been working for the company?
I think you will do okay! Get as much rest as possible tonight just in case they do an interview!
That is indeed a bummer. Maybe you can pick some up on a ticket trading website?
Seriously. It ruins it for the real fans.
Maybe you should go somewhere else
Yeah you would think they would be good by now
i have never been to church _comma_ but i understand where your coming from
maybe one day ill go _comma_ its just the way i was brought up religion was not something my family made me follow 
That must've been awful.
How old was she when she passed?
They really are. What is your favorite
Those are good too. I never saw that one
Ooh congratulations_comma_ what for? 
Best of luck with that raise. Congrats to you!
Are you excited?
i hope you enjoy art class that was always my favorite.
Oh no! Who is Matty?
Oh my.. I am so sorry. I hope you find her soon!
Do you live in a bad area or a big city?
Your safe in the woods. Most animals are more scared of you. What scared you?
If you have to leave just be very careful on the road.
Leave early and drive slower than normal. Just watch out for other drivers.
What kind of job is it
That sounds like a good one
What kind of animal is it?
Wow that's so cool_comma_ those are a type of reptile right?
when does it come out? i wanna get that too and the new online service
ah that sounds about right
Yeah_comma_ that's definitely not OK. Have you thought about contacting a tenants rights group to advocate on your behalf?
In some cases you can even legally withhold rent if they aren't doing their duty as a landlord. I'd definitely check out what you can do!
That sounds very dangerous
That would help a lot
That's great. I bet he worked hard for it.
I am happy for him! It is always nice to see people reaching their goals.
i need to start playing too _comma_ that would be awesome
it would be a great life _comma_ hope you do eventually win
never seen it. dont like scary movies much
thats cool
I'm sorry to hear that! What's stopping you from taking the trip?
Well_comma_ hopefully you can make arrangements to take the trip another time. It's hard to find a new job!
I guess that means they were good at least
That sounds like a good idea
Are you looking forward to it or nah?
Well good. Then good luck tomorrow and knock 'em dead!
did he get you there?
oh thats good
You sound like a good person then. What kind of pet is it
That sounds very exotic
That's good_comma_ did you use one of those car buying services or something?
Did you end up getting a good deal?
Oh I
I'll bet you were really glad when that flight was over!
that stinks
yea thats understandable
That's cool!  I love animals
I don't like spiders so much_comma_ but I do really like snakes. 
I didn't understand. What happened?
ok
I am sorry you had to hear that
I guess just pray about it and surround yourself with positive people
never seen it_comma_ is it that scary?
ah_comma_ maybe i need to check it out
thanks
What will you do next?
Have you found a house yet?
You have tornadoes?
That's a good thing to have
Did she pass away?
I'm sorry to hear that. Cancer is horrible. I can't wait till they find a cure.
Where did he end up flying too?
That's a long trip_comma_ do you have anything you can do to keep yourself occupied?
how is he doing?
well he has a good sibling!
Why did you miss it
Well you cant help that sometimes
Oh yeah? What kind of car?
Oh you're good then_comma_ even beat up Camrys are great cars that last forever!
Its good to have supportive siblings like you
I am sure you did_comma_ and I am sure he notices
Are you gojng to meet them again?
Good_comma_ I wish you the best of luck with it_comma_ may you find love!
I hate the dentist_comma_ they poke and prod so much.
I had braces growing up too_comma_ the worst part for me was the molding!
Like a stick shift car? You got some pretty rich friends!
Oh lol.  I hear those are expensive too_comma_ so_comma_ you got some rich friends! Lol
I bet that was a nice deal to find
I hope you have fun there then
were you able to make use of all the equipment
oh thats cool
Wow that's great! She still has to pass the bar though right?
Wow that's impressive_comma_ I'm sure with that determination she'll pass easily.
That's the worst!  People need to be more considerate and clean up after their dogs
I agree completely.  People shouldn't have to watch every single step they take just to avoid stepping in it.
You actually stole them?
Well that was nice of you
?
It always scares me too when my power goes off. I'll nearly break my toe hitting it on walls and furniture trying to light a candle lol
oh thats sweet. did he like it?
wow that was mighty nice of you
Why were you upset
Oh_comma_ well I wonder how he will pay for that then
Did you like it? I never liked it!
Yeah I agree_comma_ those days will never come back!
Oh no!  That's awful.  How did they manage that?
At least he apologized.  That makes it a little bit easier to deal with
What's going on next week?
Amen to that! Mine start wednesday and Friday!
good memories?
the good ole days 
Ugh_comma_ that is disgusting.  I'm guessing it wasn't your own?
I bet.  It would be bad enough it was just spit_comma_ but the tobacco amps it up to 11.  It would be nice if people had enough respect for others not to do that sort of stuff.
That should solve the problem!
Would you be making more money?
Well sometimes you have to spread your wings and leave the nest!
Its a good time to branch out then
There is nothing to be scared of
Has it been rainy there?
It's been the same way here_comma_ just rain rain rain.
Ohh_comma_ how did you get that?
ohh cool. I am happy for you
what happened?
wow_comma_ i did not see that coming.     on to the next one!
ohh_comma_ nice. Where did you guys go?
Cool. I like classic italian pizza
Why did you feel ruined?
What did your leaders say about it?
I haven't_comma_ did you enjoy it?
Interesting_comma_ maybe I'll check it out.
Man that really stinks. I hope that you are ok!
Oh no well at least you aren't hurt
What kind of pet was it?
Do you want to get one now?
I assume your dad has passed?
I'm sorry to hear that.  My parents are getting older... I don't even want to think about that yet.
What is that?
Oh nice_comma_ I never got into those games
It's OK we all get jealous sometimes. What did you envy about your best friend?
Don't sweat it! I am sure with hard work and determination_comma_ you will land a good job too!
Oh wow! Have you been looking for it for a long time?
Well I'm glad you found it! I know you had to be happy about that!
Those were the good old days. I wish I could go back to being that age even for just a day!
Did he buy 600 pizzas? lol
That's good. I let my daughter go school shooping alon and she spent ten dollars on one shirt. I ended up buying everything myself
Way to go. You will be glad you did that in the future.
That market has been really lately so you should see it grow. 
Awesome! Have they upgraded it any or does it look the same?
Oh wow_comma_ I bet it felt very nostalgic. Almost like being in a time machine.
How exciting. Kid's grow up to fast.
My favorite sport. Is this his first year playing?
oh yea ? does it pay well
hah.. you get used to it.
Holy cow_comma_ that IS impressive.  I can't believe people can eat that much.  Was he in a contest?
Ohhhh my goodness.  He deserves it for free if he can down 4 pounds of food.
Eww_comma_ I've had that happen. Did you say something to the person showing you the apartment?
Wow that's revolting. I'd report it to the health department!
You are so lucky. They must bring you great joy.
That is amazing. I am sure they appreciate you too.
Wonderful!  It always feels so good to be prepared and ready to crush an interview.  I bet you'll get the job because of that preparation and confidence.
Awesome!  Let me congratulate you ahead of time cause you've got this!  
good memories?
im with you there
Oh no! Do you have any pets that could get out?
That's terrible! Hopefully they'll come back home. I'd be whooping somebody if I found out who did it!
That's great. Do you think the rest of the week will be as great?
Lucky you. Are you always a positive person or it's just been an amazing week really?
Oh yeah?  I hope you did well?
Good for you!
Are you excited to move out?
Where is the house located?
You must be really glad to have them.  Did they do something nice for you recentyl?
That is really great.  Hold on to those good friends.
Where would you like to vacation too?
That sounds amazing_comma_ going to do some camping?
Did anything or anyone escape
Oh no_comma_ did you get them back
what did you learn
ah thats cool
Oh no_comma_ I hate to hear that. What were they trying to sell?
I'm sorry about that.
Yeah they always seem to grow up so fast. 
Yeah but just think. The best is yet to come!
What do you guys do for work together?
That's awesome_comma_ do you make enough to afford your payments?
Oh no!  That's not your journey then.  Do you have other places you applied?
I'm so sorry.  I know it must be tough right now but it is happening for a reason.  Make your dreams happen no matter where it is! 
Why did you cancel?
Oh_comma_ that makes sense_comma_ I am sure they understand
That is a beautiful thing
I am sure it will
Really?  Are you scared by lots of movies?
Awwww... That's cute.  
Oh I am sorry to hear that_comma_ how old was it?
Oh_comma_ well that is a long time_comma_ but a stronger bond as well
Who left it open?
Did you complain to their customer service?
oh wow im sorry to hear that. glad to hear they got a good friend
i hope they get well
Are you serious? You dont deserve that.
Thats rough. Im sure you will be better in the long run. 
What songs were on it?
Oh baby that sounds like fun to me_comma_ I loved old eminem.
What team?
Oh_comma_ I am sorry to hear that
What is going so great?
Tell me about it.
Oh no! I hate when that happens! Did you turn off your alarm in your sleep?
It happens to me more than I like to admit lol
Its always nice to find clothes that fit well
Yeah_comma_ if you find a brand you like_comma_ stick with it
Have you won before?
Really? That is enough to retire if you know how to manage it!
you know what they say about chip kelly?
f chip kelly
Haha I know exactly what you mean! My uncle pranked his coworker once with a bag of sugar free candy. I feel for you_comma_ seriously.
Oh man that is really bad. I feel sorry for laughing. 
That's a great feeling I love mine as well.
That's impressive_comma_ she sounds amazing.
Oh no!  Are you itching all over now? 
That's good.  I hope it gets better soon :(
Where is it taking place?
Oh wow_comma_ that is a huge life event then_comma_ best of luck?
They are making another one? Those games were always so successful.
That is so cool. I might have to get a Switch.
yea that sucks.. feeling those cars zoom by you
well at least you lived to tell us about it!
What did you miss because of work?
I'm sorry that's awful I bet he's sad.
That is awesome!  I know how hard it is to lose weight.  She  must be so happy.
I feel you.  That's how my body functions too. Slow weight loss or not at all.  Its also dangerous to lose weight too quickly so don't wish it for yourself too fast.  Slowly and steadily keeps you from getting lose skin or gaining it all back too. 
I used to have the same problem_comma_ I'd always hear a bunch of spooky noises after everyone left.
I worked night shift alone in an office and I'd always hear foot steps in the hallway 
That is very nice_comma_ what movie did you see?
How was it?
Oh really? Did you recover?
That is a scary feeling
Did you go to your mechanic for maintenance?
I understand
Did you report them to anyone
I am sorry you went through thaty
you should be!
wow thats great!
What do you have planned for next weekend?
What does that mean?
Those things are gross
They are not normal animals for sure
That's understandable_comma_ companionship is great. Do you think you will seek one soon?
Yea definitely_comma_ but only if you feel inclined.
I know what you mean! I got caught out in it by surprise_comma_ totally ruined my bike ride.
Yeah_comma_ lightning is no joke. Hopefully you have better weather this weekend and can get out!
Did they win their preseason game? 
That's great if they quaterback is good and have a good defense they got it.
What do you have planned?
That's going to be fun_comma_ little catch and release?
Heck yeah that's awesome!  Did you celebrate with him
Did you pick up at least 95% of the tab? lol
have you gone to the doctor?
that sucks. i hope it turns out well for you
The week just started_comma_ ha ha.  Do you have some fun plans?
Awesome_comma_ my brother-in-law does that.  He loves it.  Hope its beautiful weather for you!
oh thats cool_comma_ what are you going to study
thats cool
Were you in a bad part of town?
That is scary! You be careful!
Wow_comma_ what a stroke of luck! Who did you such a solid?
That's so very fortunate! There are still some kind-hearted people out there after all.
Nothing feels worse than losing time to work when you should be free.
Hopefully they at least paid you overtime.
What breed is it?
That is awesome_comma_ too bad it will not be small forever!
What type of job are you applying for?
I bet you are_comma_ but don't worry you got this!
Well_comma_ you are supposed to tell me about something that made you feel a certain way.  Please share.
That's great!  Having a job is a big deal - and I'm sure it was a blessing after not having one for three years!!  Congrats to you!
i bet that was very nice sounds like a nice family you have i bet you are so happy
lol  she will get better 
I feel you have you tried setting a schedule or is it from lack of rest.
You may need a vacation or take a little break you don't want to overwork or wear your body down to much.
what kind of buisiness are you running?
hrmmm .. seems interesting. hopefully legal.
Is it a lizard?
Oh lord! That's kind of scary
That's interesting I have a tv by my couch as well. You have good taste.
Oh I didn't realize your brother had control of it because he slept there. Hopefully he finds another spot more comfy.
Were able to save any of it
It happens to all of us
Hopefully he is ok_comma_ did they find anything wrong?
That's pretty scary_comma_ hopefully they can get him some meds and he gets to come home.
That's so exciting! How did it go?
That is amazing! You must feel pretty proud of her.
oh wow i didnt even know they go for that long. i hope all goes well for you all!
well is he going back?
Oh no.  What happened?  Is your dog okay?
Oh no! I'm so sorry!  I assume you don't have a Chip implanted to track it? That's awful_comma_ I'd be furious!
Wow that would scare me too. What caused it?
Sorry to hear that you're in that situation. Hope you stay safe
Oh no! Is she stressed about something?
Ahh_comma_ that could be it. Sometimes when my cat is stressed she poops or throws up.
That's awesome. Maybe you have natural talent for it and should try to become a singer!
You could always post videos to social media in your spare time and see how well received it is. Many people have made it big starting out that way.
Oh no_comma_what happened?
That is so sad_comma_ I hope you find him.
how long is grad school?
thats not bad_comma_ good luck
Hey good for you!  Plenty of good boys and girls there?
Yeah but at least they get to see you often so you can give them some love and pets!
That's awesome!  Keep up the good work_comma_ my friend :D
That's so awesome!
Is it acting crazy or just not working?
You could name it Bob Marley since it's always "jammin" lol I couldn't resist
Record it and have a "Office Space" moment with it lol
How did you meet them?
It's always nice to go somewhere you can meet a lot of new people.
I would be too_comma_ were you in a shopping center?
People are so careless.
oh thats cool
how old is he
I have never even heard of that movie_comma_ but I'm sure it would scare me.  I have never watched a horror movie in my life_comma_ and I won't
Yeah_comma_ I get scared easily by everyday things I don't need to help my imagination along.  What do you do to keep yourself from thinking about it?
What did you say>
That is nasty_comma_ but some people just do not care
When does it come out?
I would love to play with you sometime.
What team is that?
Oh_comma_ I am sorry to hear that 
What makes you say that?
I bet it felt really good to let that all out and to still be accepted by her.
did you give her stuff back
she knows it was you?
What happened?
Good luck for this weekend.
That happened to me a couple months ago. It was a brand new tire which really sucked
Was there construction going on near your house? Someone had done work on my roof and I think maybe the nail in my tire came from there.
Well Happy Birthday!  Did you have a nice time?
Oh no!  I hope you feel better now and that you had a good time while you were on the trip at least.
I do. Why do you say that about her?
That's terrible. Her kids are going to resent her.
Were you alone?
I don't blame you_comma_ I would be scared too.  It seems like you got home alright though_comma_ so that is good.
thats cool. what kind of car are you getting
oh wow!
Sounds like it was a great trip and good memory to have_comma_ do you have a family of your own to take them on the same Disney cruise?
Lol maybe one day your son is still small you have lot's of time to save_comma_ I think I will look into it for me and my family for our next vacation. 
Do you have some awesome plans?
I've been regular rod and reel fishing and love it_comma_ but I've never been fly fishing.  Do you enjoy it?
brought back good memories?
they grow up so fast.
Yeah it is_comma_ I always thought stunt doubles were cool
I agree_comma_ it is tough work!
Don't worry about him.  Keep working on you.  I'm sure you have a lot of great qualities.
I understand.  Its hard to not compare yourself with others but we're all made differently with our own strengths.  Try to shine with those!
Ooh I love cheesecake! Is it your own recipe or one that was handed down to you or what?
I will definitely have to try that next time I make cheesecake_comma_ thanks for the tip!
Older songs definitely have more texture and quality to them compared to the manufactured stuff we have that all sounds the same
Yeah when robots are like walking around playing the latest hologram music or something haha
That's a good feeling I'm sure.  Stability means a lot these days.
8 more years?  I wish I could retire in 8 years!  I bet that's exciting to think about!!
is he ok?
is he at the hospital?
Something dear and sentimental you should wear it sometimes on special occasions. 
That is even better I know how you feel I lost my grand pa and he was everything to me I miss him dearly. 
What happened?
That sucks_comma_ did you find them?
who
ah.. thats understandable then
Why not?
I love video games. Thats not a bad weekend
Theres always next weekend
Hey cool!  Did you all catch up on old times?
Oh heck yes!  That sounds awesome!  bring me back some of your winnings!
hahaha awesome!  Have fun this weekend mate!
haha!  Copy that_comma_ will do!
Dang_comma_ I guess you should get on that_comma_ hopefully you drew straws or something_comma_ but at least you found the source!
Or get the cat on that_comma_ all they do is sleep anyway
They didn't leave a note!?!?!?!?  That is the worst.  That is the kind of thing that makes you want to bring out forensics to take a paint sample and hunt the people down to bring them to justice.
Ugh_comma_ that should be illegal...wait a minute...I think it is illegal.  So frustrating.
thats a nice birthday gift
take tons of pictures
I love puppies what kind did you get? 
I never seen a husky with blue eyes I know it is beautiful great addition to the family. 
you saw that?
Who did it?
Is that a good memory or bad one?
Oh yeah_comma_ that is a rough phase
when does it return?
oh thats a long time away
whats going on?
i love fishing
I live far away from my family so I understand completely. Why did you move?
Of course_comma_ it's always better when family is close. I hope you can visit with them soon!
Wow that's awful_comma_ do you know who?
I used to love the old starfox games.
I'm so sorry to hear that!
That is awful_comma_ I can't wait until they find a cure.
Wow_comma_ that's amazing of him_comma_ it must be really hard.
That's really kind of you_comma_ I bet he appreciates all the help he can get big or small.
I'm sorry you were sick_comma_ but that's a good girlfriend taking care of you like that.
That's pretty special_comma_ you should probably keep her!
Did you guys figure it out?
That is really good timing! I think dads have that instinct when their children need help.
Oh man!  That's sick!  So close!  That is torture.  
Horrible!!! I know you probably could've used it to go on a vacay_comma_ right? Outer Banks beach or something? Right? Sorry man.
That is terrifying.  Do you think someone is messing with you_comma_ or do you think it is nothing?
I k now exactly what you mean.  Your neighbor must be really weird.  I used to want to move to the beach_comma_ but then my wife got really weird about it.  Now she is obsessed and I'm kinda' cooling on the idea.  She can be really overbearing.  You know what I mean_comma_ man?
Are those the 20 dollar socks why are they so expensive? 
I'll take the regular socks and just double them lol must be some magical socks. 
Sweet. Will there be new characters?
When did you start playing?
That is good_comma_ that is rare these days unfortunately
That is sad but in our times_comma_ that should not be taken for granted
What style of pizza did you order?
Which toppings did you get?
Why? What's going on?
Did they buy it?
You must be so proud of yourself.
What school did you pick?
Oh no! Why?
That sucks_comma_ maybe you guys can plan something for another weekend before it gets cold. I'm sure it will be cheaper too.
Should you call the police or something?  I hate being home alone for this exact reason.
Or a cat maybe?  Maybe you should look into installing those motion flood lights or something so that you feel safer when you are home alone.
I don't think I have ever had some_comma_ what is it?
That sounds delicious_comma_ you are making my mouth water.  Have fun this weekend...I know you will!
Oh no. Why are you nervous?
I hope it's just something you're eating.
I am so sorry to hear that_comma_ that's such a hard decision to make. 
I will hug my kitty just a little closer just knowing how short our time together is. Sending you love and healing!
Maybe he doesn't sleep. Some people just have their lives together. Can't relate haha
Maybe it's adderall? It's very popular in schools
Really? What is your favorite ice cream?
Those sounds delicious. I should go get some before the summer ends!
Lol I know you was bad he may need to watch what he eats or at least warn you next time.
If y'all ate something green like vegetables that could be the reason keep the spray close next time. 
Are you excited about it or not really?
That's awesome then. I hope your trip will be a fruitful one!
That is nice. Are you going alone?
I hope you have a good time.
Did you end up finding anything eventually or no?
At least you're nice and comfortable on the couch?
Me too! They are the best!  Little Mermaid!  Beauty and the Beast!  What's your favorite if you can pick?
Ha ha_comma_ that's a great one.  Did Disney do Flubber? 
Wow_comma_ great job friend_comma_ that is no easy feat!
Good_comma_ use it as a catapault_comma_ that is a great idea!
You will be ok. Just prepare for it and it will go great.
Dont psyche yourself out. Just be confident and yourself.
That sounds pretty serious. What did she do?
Did your mother-in-law report her to the police?
That's absolutely disgusting! What did you do?
That sounds terrible. I really hope your future excursions are dung free!
What did you tell him that happened?
Didn't he call and ask your brother?
I hear you_comma_ are you getting the day off of work?
That sounds awesome.  Where are you going?
Is that good or bad?
Good_comma_ enjoy it when you get it_comma_ that is what I say
That's what we called as family. Good that you've good family.
Yeah! My family is everything to me!
I think I can understand that.  It was a bit simpler than all this adulting we have to do.
You and me both!  My kids are almost raised and I'll probably go back to work soon_comma_ but would actually love a different degree now.  It's never too late to go back you know.
She sounds like an amazing person_comma_ but the lice is no bueno.
Oh wow. I didn't know it could spread like that.
While ramen is amazing_comma_ I agree_comma_ it might be time to try something new.
Heck_comma_ I lived on that stuff in college.  I was an Iron Chef at Ramen cooking back in the day
What are you guys betting on?
hahaha so how long is it now?
Wow impressive! You must be very proud.
So what's next for her? I imagine with that great GPA she has many options to choose from.
Wow I would be furious_comma_ what did you do?
Oh_comma_ that sucks_comma_ best of luck finding a good laptop!
I am so sorry to hear that. Are you with family?
Yea. It helps to not isolate yourself. Sometimes when people go through a loss like that_comma_ they isolate themselves and it just makes you feel worse.
Oh_comma_ I am sorry to hear that_comma_ maybe next time!
Yeah_comma_ you gotta look on the bright side sometimes
Oh no. How old was she when she passed?
Oh that's still pretty young.
lol maybe you need to practice more!
Yeah cooking is so much fun.  Especially when you try out different things!
Why? What's happening this weekend?
Oh sweet. Is this your first time?
I'm sorry to hear that.
What happened to the other guy?
Oh no. That's not good!
Have you had high blood pressure for a while now?
That is awesome_comma_ what is your field of study?
That is great.  Is it a big firm?
Aww that's sweet! What movie? 
Oh wow! So you have been for a long time? 
That's terrifying!  I had that happen near me before too.  Two guys screaming at each other arguing in the road.  I'm glad you're okay.  
That's great that you have flood lights.  I really need to get at least one since we're on the corner of the street.  Glad they apprehended them! Crazy people!
I hate it when that happens!  I bet you were frustrated that all that work waas gone.
That's a lot to lose_comma_ you'd think that with technology what it is there would be some sort of autosave function on everything you do.
Oh boy_comma_ that's not a good start.
hahaha I think we've all done that. It's just the first day anyway.
Are you nervous?
I always make a first date a group one. easier to get out that way lol
Really? what else is he going to do?
he can't coach the giants lol
How old are you now?
You should still do stuff_comma_ your not that old.
When children disappoint us_comma_ it can be particularly upsetting. What did he do?
You don't deserve that! He's lucky to have someone cooking for him!
Oh well good for him! I don't see many older people actually making an effort to 'fool around' with technology_comma_ they all get too frustrated with it
Thats awful_comma_ if I were there and he crossed the line_comma_ I would speak to someone above him about it. 
aww that sounds adorable! Is he getting to big boy age?
hahaha oh no. The adventures of being a parent lol.
Do you have a fast metabolism then? I wish I had that!
Make sure you have routine physicals so that you can get anything else that might need to be adjusted fixed_comma_ etc.. but you are right_comma_ at least you don't have to worry about weight.
I"m so sorry to hear that. She must've been devastated.
I am so sorry to hear that. She might be hard to be around_comma_ but I hope you spend some time with her.
wow. congratualations. do you think she is expecting it?
what is the plan?
Most people are dreading it. How come you're looking forward to it?
Oh yea! Congratulations!
What made you come to that decision_comma_ I get angry when people leave carts close to others cars. 
Maybe it was a honest mistake then since she was elderly I see why you didn't want to give her up. 
That's not good. Procrastination can lead to a lot of stress.
Hopefully she will learn quickly that it's better to get her school work done quickly
Dang! Ask her out!
Alright alright_comma_ you can go the slow route
That is amazing!  So many people do not stay married these days_comma_ you should be proud of that accomplishment!
It's 100% for both of you!  It takes two to tango you know - Congrats on 35 years!
That is not fun.  Do the police have any leads?
That is a good thing.  Have you thought about getting a camera and posting that you have one on the property.
What happened?
Oh no.  That is pretty bad.  Do you know who she is that you could go and leave her a tip? Mistakes happen and there's not much you can do.
Oh man that's terrible :(  I'm so sorry. 
Yeah.  My grandmother was like that too.  The backbone of the family.  We all went our separate ways pretty much after she died.  Don't let that happen to your family!
That's great to hear! Will you be in the ceremony?
I'm so happy for you! I am sure it will be a wonderful day for both of you!
Ut oh.. what is your favorite?  I like so many I can't pick just one.
I haven't tried that one yet  I will now.  I love blueberries.. and I like chex.
Why is he in the ICU?
I'm sorry_comma_ I hope he recovers!
What does that mean? A raise at work?
oh. congratulations!
you should hook up with somebody then!!
it is not!! but you got to give it a try
That really stinks. You didn't go with them?
Ah. Well_comma_ I suppose it's a good thing you didn't know him. Less heartache for you_comma_ I suppose.
That's great_comma_ how do you feel about it?
Congratulations then.  What kind of job is it?
Congratulations on that. You truly did it. Age is just a number. I hope you have your whole life ahead of you yet
it is almost over. Senior year is the final one and it will pass quickly. Been there_comma_ done that
You will. Being prepared always helps
Thats right. I think you got it already. You know exactly what to do
That is true for some
If you love each other and stay close you will be fine.
I agree.  That happened to me and I had to stop watching them.  I worry too much about it happening to me or_comma_ even worse_comma_ my kids.
I know. Hearing statistics doesn't help either.  Crazy people doing things every 3 seconds.
Some men are such animals. Is she very attractive?
That
Dang_comma_ that must have been difficult to clean up_comma_ what did you eat after that?
Ramen_comma_ ah you must be in college?
I bet that is kind of sad to see it go.
Where will the current students of that school go?
That's nice to hear! What's going on in your life?
So many people just want more and more. I think you got it right.
i hope it will come better and it will!!
you must have been very careful with the do'd and don'ts!!
Oh no. Accidents happen. I feel really sorry for the dog.
Did you go back?
Dang that Sara!  Did you tell her how unhappy you were with her?
Yeah I understand.  Maybe you should pay her back somehow.
Put sugar in her salt shaker next time you're at her house :D
LOL.  Good luck!  Glad you made it home safe :)
Oh no...what did you do? 
Yes. I LOVE EGGPLANT! How could  you find that really gross? 
Hahaha_comma_ well to each their own_comma_ because I love how eggplant is mushy. 
Yeah_comma_ and I don't think you can ever go wrong with deep fried food. Anything deep fried is delicious :D 
That's really good! Is he very smart?
I wish the best for your son. I am sure he will do well wherever he goes.
Are you confident you will pass?
Well you got this then
Everything happens for a reason
Right_comma_ nothing can take that awy
I used to like watching scary movies. Not my thing anymore.
Maybe you can talk yourself out of it?
Im sorry to hear that
Thats a good way to think about it
I'm sorry to hear that. Why did you miss seeing her?
aw no. Maybe you should tell her that_comma_ so next time she'll come when you have time?
I bet they will be a lot better_comma_ I heard vegetarian helps a lot with that.
The only negative effect I've read is the lack of protein_comma_ but I'm sure there are substitutes!
OH goodness!  I'm glad you are ok_comma_ what happened?
WOW!  That person needs to loose their license I believe - you are so blessed you were not hurt.
Congratulations!  Marriages take work but it is totally worth it when you have a good partner.  Did you do anything special for the anniversary?
I've never been on one either_comma_ but that sounds like so much fun.  Have a good time!
Why is he not asleep? 
He will learn with age.
Why?
In a school zone? thats not good
oh why!! do you guys support separate teams!!
poor him !! you should have bee angry or furious!!
What kind of cancer?
You gotta have some faith.
That is horrible_comma_ but I've been there myself.  It's hard to not be upset about it.
I know what you mean_comma_ it is hard.  The only advice I have is that God is always there even when no one else is.
I miss my dad.. been so long.   What did you guys talk about?
my mom had Alzheimers.. it sucks!
Me either! Do you have any plans?
That's sounds like a blast! I've never been courageous enough to attempt that.
What prompted you to do that?  Did you tell someone and clear your conscience?
Best thing you can do is tell the truth and clear it up. Its not worth it and you only cheat yourself.  You can do it and you'll feel better.
oh that so sad!! Did you try searching him everywhere!!
omg !! you would have been devastated!!
That is too bad. Are they okay?
Oh that is horrible! I cannot imagine what he must be going through!
How come? What year did you join?
Oh that's nice_comma_ yeah it's a good feature of Facebook
Cool. Are you in charge?
Sounds like a lot of work ahead
I'm sorry you don't feel well_comma_ is it a cold or something more serious?
I hope you feel better before this big meeting - or maybe you can reschedule it or something.
What are you going to do?
I love cruise_comma_ I go on at least one every year.
Legs weak arms are heavy?
oh.
That's great_comma_ what job is it?
I have never met someone who has done that for a job.
Are you a birthday clown?
Wanna invest in a clown?
Do you feel bad for teasing him?
Yeah_comma_ it's funny how drastically people can change as they grow.
Did you get a chance to talk to them yet_comma_ and introduce yourself?
Have you considered getting back at them by pranking them?
That's so awesome!  Are they adopting domestically or abroad?  My husband and I tried to adopt from Japan but our paperwork expired before we could and then I got pregnant. I hope it goes well for them!
It will be so worth it when that child is in their arms!  I'm so happy for them and the child they are saving!
What do you think you are going to do_comma_ are you going to talk to him and find out?
Or you could find out he has a thing for you!  I hope either way that it works out for all of you.
Oh_comma_ have you done this before?
Wow_comma_ good luck sounds realy hard to me.
Hey that's amazing!!!  You don't see that often these days
You got that right!  Good job :D   What do you all do these days?  Anything fun?
What was in there?
Nice!!!  Nothing better than getting money in the mail!
I am sure you are looking forward to it. What don't you like about it?
Sorry about your bad luck. Glad you are getting out of that place!
Will you be in trouble for not reinstating it?
I hope it works out for you.
Did anything get stolen?
I'm glad they didn't run away.
Oh me. too.. Whats the craziest thing you remember happening?
Thats funny.  I never did anything that daring!
Awesome! What are your vacation plans?
Oh man_comma_ I'm jealous. Have fun and don't forget to wear sunscreen!
Are you excited?
me too. I have three kids too
Are you serious?  There's a noise ordinance for no loud noise or music after 10:00p.m.!
You might have to call the cops just to get sleep! Horrible.  Sorry.
I'm so sorry you are going through this.  Maybe it would be a good thing to get a therapist so that you have someone that can help you through it.
Well_comma_ I hope you do find that special someone_comma_ and that the stress at work lets up a bit as well.
Congratulations on that. That is a great life milestone for her. Is she planning on getting into a college?
Sounds great. I wish all the best in her future endeavors. 
Did it get worse or better?
That's horrible_comma_ you should set up an app that lets your family track you
That sucks
You hvent taken anything yet?
That was very generous of you.
I hope so too. There's nothing worse than someone you trust not repaying you.
What is it?
oh yeah that really do grind!!
Aww that's awesome!  Did you take a day off and go through them for the memories???
Yeah I'm so happy for you!  I need to go through some of my old stuff!!
Oh no! Were you upset about it ?
I am sorry that happened I would be upset too! 
That is very disrespectful_comma_ especially since he is not in a stand-alone home.  Can you tell your landlord about it?
That is just crazy!  I hope he stops really soon - or you can figure out how to cut the power off on his side - LOL!
That is so exciting!  What torture waiting for a whole year!  Where are you going?
So fun!  Hope you have a great time!  
Cake always hits the spot when you have a sweet tooth. Was it from a birthday?
Moderation is key_comma_ so you don't get sick!
Dang! That's like a 13 year old gets an extra mozz stick and ska plays in his head!
I gotta go to McDonald's more often to cash in on these free nuggets!
Ewwwwwwwww! Was it a runny poop or a solid poop?
Yeah I would have totally done the same. That's why I don't want a dog lol!
Oh I bet! Did you move far away?
Wow! Why did you move so far? 
I am so sorry. Did they give you another one for free?
I would feel they same way_comma_ but that was nice of them! 
Why did you feel like you needed to steal candy?
Stealing very rarely is worth it_comma_ that doesn't stop people from doing it.
LOL....Best thing to do when that happens is deny_comma_ deny_comma_ deny.
Smart move on your part. 
Did they hit you?
I know what you mean_comma_ I would have been pissed! Probably would have gotten out and throat punched them if they had hit me!
What did she bring back?
Wow that's awful_comma_ I had lice in school.
On social media?  or on the TV?
I've never really watched youtube that much_comma_ I'm not sure what I'd even watch on there.  But I know what you mean_comma_ the content can be pretty despicable.
I did that too!  I remember it was a package of Big League Chew.  My mom took me back to the store and made me talk to the manager.  Did you have to do that as well?
I'm not sure what 5 is_comma_ but it's a good story to tell your kids if you have any.  I've told both of mine_comma_ and they luckily have not done the same thing.
Have you found any good ones?
Nice! It's always good to sit around a tell the tales of your youth to our children :)
WOW_comma_ how amazing!  I love surprise parties.  Did you get a lot of good stuff?
That is awesome_comma_ I mean the gifts are nice_comma_ but it's even better to know that you've got people that love and care about you.
Aw_comma_ I am sorry to hear that. Is she still alive and well?
Awwwwww poor little doggie. I am sure she is chasing around mailmen happily in doggy heaven.
Did you nurse her back to health and get some weight on her?
I bet she was so tiny!  I'm glad you found her and were able to take care of her.
Oh no_comma_ it really sucks seeing someone you care about date someone who isn't good
I bet if you say anything about it_comma_ you're the bad one too
That's really rough man. Is there any way you can get her back?
I am sure you'll find somebody in due time. It took me 6 years to find someone after my last relationship_comma_ but it happened. It'll happen to you too!
Those good old times of fantasy. Kid's world is so full of imagination and self-scaring created things
Here is an idea. Why don't you get yourself a teddy bear by your side when sleeping. He will protect you
Oh no!  How old is he/she?
Yeah I understand.  Is there anywhere you can take it to get it fixed?
Now why is it going to be scary? Going to a haunted house?
For what? Hallowscream at Busch Gardens?!?!? If so_comma_ that place is a blast.
Oh no! That is one of my biggest fears!  What did you do?
I sure hope you get to keep your job.  I know it was a big accident_comma_ but it was an accident.
Oh no_comma_ I know that is so disappointing first hand.  The same thing has happened to me for the last three years.  Is everything going well_comma_ though?
That is a real bummer.  Maybe you can have a makeup vacation in September.
I hope it went well!! she is alright now right?
that's just nice of you!! helping out your sister!!
Congrats! That is great news!
I bet! You deserve to be proud and excited though. You have worked hard for this.
That's so scary! I hope your dog is OK.
I can imagine. Glad you are both alright.
Eh_comma_ you'll get there eventually. Besides_comma_ big houses aren't even that great! All you need is a moderate amount of space to live comfortably.
And that's the best part. Many of those folks with nice houses have mountains of debt. It causes a lot of stress.
Well_comma_ since he's supposed to be IN the water_comma_ you may have a fatality on your hands.
Yeah_comma_ you'd better find him like quick!  Or flood your house until you do - either way..
I love animals too. What are their names?
That is such a unique name I love it.
Ah that's so terrible. Did you find him?
i think it becomes a practice for him!!
That's terrible. Did he get hurt?
Man_comma_ I am truly sorry. If I knew you_comma_ I would definitely help you out.
Oh no! Do you have any other work lined up?
I hope everything works out for you_comma_ I know how hard shut downs can be. 
That's so nice. I've done that a few times and really enjoyed it
And you're doing something amazing!
Oh that is the worst.  It really puts you on edge.  What will happen if it doesn't come on time?
I really hope that it comes on time.  It can be so disappointing when something like that ruins your perfect plans.
Sorry to hear that. Have you tried to explain your side of things to your boss?
Hopefully this type of situation doesn't happen again. That really is disappointing how the system doesn't protect the employees about that type of situation.
That is funny what did she do?
That is amazing I guess she deserves to be spoon fed!
That sounds relaxing
i hope you have many more
Ugh_comma_ that's always the worst. I hope it wasn't something urgent you were waiting on?
Yeah_comma_ I've had them do that to me before too. It's a pain in the keester.
OMG...I know what you mean. I can't stand for anything to crawl on me or near me. Did you see any?
LOL....Their waiting for you to let your guard down and then they will attack you.
Oh my god! I have the heebiejeebies just thinking about it! Did it attack you?!?!
I am glad to hear you are alright. But I would still be on the look out for next time...they are the relatives of godzilla after all.
Wow you must be so proud!
I hope he keeps it up!
I'm sorry_comma_ that's quite disgusting.
That is a major issue.
Nice! I am glad to hear that you got to use your Baywatch-esque skills!
That's great man. You just have to wrestle a few sharks and they'll appoint you head lifeguard of the state.
I don't know if that is a good thing or a bad thing_comma_ but either way it is EPIC.
It is hard to recover from a binge like that_comma_ but do a few thousand situps and you'll be good as new!
That really sucks. Did you make it up to your co-worker?
That's good to hear that you and your co-worker mad amends. Live and learn!
Whoa! Did you have a strong craving or something?
That's okay to give in sometimes and enjoy the moment. 
Oh_comma_ that must be stressful. Do you think he is going to be fine?
Oh_comma_ that must be stressful. Do you think he is going to be fine?
All you must have been proud of yourself
That's so terrible. How could they ditch you!!
That is pretty awesome_comma_ was it something you really wanted?
You should write a good review_comma_ sounds like they know what they are doing.
That's kinda terrible. Did you apologize to him?
Well_comma_ as long as you did and the wife doesn't know_comma_ you're in the clear!
oh no_comma_ that's teribble
he should do his work properly. He is such a naughty boy to do on the rug!!
Dang! I bet that feeling felt incredible! Did you guys celebrate?
Well_comma_ that's kinda meh. But congratulations still!
That is awesome.  Is this for college?
You must be feeling great.  What are you studying?
I am an officer in the United States Navy_comma_ but I agree with you. How about yourself?
I have sailed all over the glove. Hit a couple of countries in Europe_comma_ a few scattered islands across the Atlantic. And the best part is_comma_ I've never been deployed! So I am truly living the dream that every sailor hopes for lol. I was very fortunate.
Awful. I'm so sorry. Have you tried putting up posters?
No doubt he will when he gets cold and hungry. 
That's great! What was it?
He will be rich one day!
That was rude of them. Did you beat their face in?
I would be too. Did you tell the manager?
Ah yes!  How did it make you feel?
That's awesome!  Did it brighten your day?
Oooh free from what?
Wow that's awesome! To the beach?
Congratulations! Do you feel relieved to be done with school?
What did you study?
Awesome! So you'd recommend it if I were looking for a new phone?
I've never been a phone of Apple anyway. I had the first iPhone and wasn't impressed so I never tried again.
Great idea. Where are you planning on visiting?
Why don't you take them to Six Flags. It is more fun and full of exciting experiences rushed with adrenaline
Ooh_comma_ that's exciting. What did he say? 
Wow_comma_ that's amazing_comma_ haha. So fancy. 
That must have been fun to go through and remember the good old days.
I love going through old memories and reliving the glory days.  Are you still friends with some of the folks you knew back then?
If you keep doing them you'll look better!
Maybe you should go on a diet so you don't feel sick :D
Yeah_comma_ I wish I had a nice car too.
It would be nice to have money like that.
That was really nice of your neighbor. I wish i had one like that
Good you should be for having such a blesses neighbor
That is so cool!
That is crazy!  Most kids first words are "money".
Pretty savvy place! Were you working on your 1000 page manuscript for 10 hours_comma_ squatting for free internet?
That's great! I go there almost every single day and get a bread bowl!
I too feel your pain. I broke my diet by eating 4 dozen donuts in one sitting. 
We'll get back on the horse together_comma_ my friend. Skinnier days are ahead of us!
That sounds like a nice and relaxing day. What book were you enjoying?
It's really cool to have those moments where you get to enjoy what you like to do.
Woah how did you manage to eat 12 pizzas
oh oh. It's alright next time you should be bit careful not eat a lot
Oh man! A rookie mistake! Did your date notice the foul stench?
Well_comma_ I guess it didn't turn out too bad. Are you guys going for another?
woah really nice!! what and all they did
you must have really enjoyed it
I know! It's terrible everywhere! And I'm the only one who knows how to drive because I created the automobile!
Ugh. The horn is the worse! Especially those loud_comma_ obnoxious semi-truck horns!
Are you baking? What did you burn.
That is pretty unfortunate. You should be like me and just buy them_comma_ always easier when someone else does the work.
That's really gross. Did you say anything to him about it?
For sure. That really isn't something a normal person should be doing. Or anyone for that matter.
Wow_comma_ that is really impressive!
They would be very jealous!
Three weeks to what?!?!?!?!?!?
Awesome!  Where are you going?
lol hey at least it was your neighbors sidewalk and not yours
Maybe you should find out who did it and go throw toilet paper all over their yard!!
Really? What was it_comma_ that must of been pretty wild.
hmm_comma_ that is a pretty epic first world. You would think that would be a little two difficult for a first word. The kid must be a genius
I hope too !! I think you will do well!!
omg!! millionaire that works at McDonalds. I would like to see you work 
Dang. Do you have the whole house to yourself?
That's really rough. Maybe you should go to the gym and meet some friends?
That is funny. Dogs can be careless. You should take better care of it
You seem to be very fed up with him. How long have you had him?
It makes me feel the same. That's why I voted for myself in the last election.
Truly unacceptable. We would be better off with chimpanzees in office.
That man is a winner if he kept it all down!
I am really amazed.  Was it you?
I'm sorry that keeps happening to you.
I agree_comma_ your talents would be better suited elsewhere. 
That is pretty unlucky. At lease it wasn't a power outage though.
It's like 100 degrees during the day_comma_ you would have had to find a pool to jump in.
That's terrible! Is it a festering wound that will turn you into a zombie?
Nonsense! If you're a zombie_comma_ you'll be brainless and the scar will be the least of your worries!
You must be really excited of the interview and i hope you will do well
You will nail it. Just be confident and just be yourself!!
That is so exciting! What did he say?
That is so cute! Be sure and jot that down in the baby book!
Dang_comma_ that's rough. Are you set up for next month at least?
That's great man. At least you'll have a place to stay for the next month.
That's so nice of them. Where did they find it?
that's a surprise and it's after 5 long years
That's terrible! Did you manage to find it?
That sucks man. Do you have another grandma who can give you a new one?
oh no!!That's just terrible. did you made him to clean by himself!!
Naughty dog. he should look after himself
Really? I'm thinking about buying one myself. What kind are you getting?
Nice. I have my eye on a Tesla.
Awesome_comma_ do you think you are prepared for it?
Just take deep breaths and act confidently and you'll do great!
That is indeed pretty gross. Perhaps you should help her clean it up?
I don't blame you_comma_ but we have to help our struggling siblings out!
I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ that's got to be tough on you.
Mine died a couple years ago and I still think of her. :(
What kind of website are you planning on designing?
Nice! Perhaps I can go buy a car on the website one day!
Holy cow that's amazing!  That's awesome of you!!
That's the coolest thing I've heard all day
That is such a great age.  Is he doing well?
What position does he play?
Hmmm. Have you asked to go over for a dip? He never said you couldn't come over and partake in the fun!
I am sure! Please let him know that I am game to come over for a pool party!
Ruh Roh! Did it come out of the rug easily?
Yeah_comma_ that's never a good experience.  Coming home to that smell and mess_comma_ ugh!
Wow_comma_ that's awful. Why did he do that?
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope he can get the help he needs.
You should get some bug spray. Fly's are nasty
I once chased a fly around my room for 30 mins_comma_ never caught it_comma_ I think it was all in my head?
Same_comma_ my friend! France played so well.
I do hope you rubbed it into your co-workers' faces like I did!
ah_comma_ happy birthday in advance to you. And what's the plan
They definitely will get you a rum cake
Used to be? What happened to it? Did it get closed down?
That sounds alarming. You better be careful next time visiting the place. They maybe careless with their sanitary responsibilities
That would get very irritating. Have you talked to her about it and let her know how you feel?
Thats too bad. I am sure it makes things very stressful and difficult.
Ah_comma_ you are going to miss him
I feel sorry for you. I just hope you guys atleast meet now and then!!
I am so happy for you!
Just be a good husband and you should be fine.
I have no idea. What happened?
Oh thank goodness you weren't late.
Does it bother you when she does that?
It can really be annoying when someone tells you what to do.  Have you talked to her about it?
Did you just clean your place?
Mmmm_comma_ I love that brownie smell.  Also nothing better than fresh brownies.
Only you can change that_comma_ my friend!
Hey that's great!  You should take a before picture today and an after picture one month from now!
That's terrible. Have you gone to a dentist to get it checked out?
I would be terrified too. You have to do get it checked out!
Are you nervous?
don't be !! you will do well. Just be yourself!!
That is not good_comma_ I don't think iguana's can live out in the wild.
maybe you should lay out some bait_comma_ he has to get hungry sometime.
That must be great!
He sounds like an excellent boss!
Oh no_comma_ that is embarrassing.  Were you able to recover by the end?
I am so sorry that happened to you.  Will you get another crack at it sometime?
I'm sorry.
You must be very comfortable in your office! How did they react?
I am sorry that you now live in infamy. Maybe_comma_ with time_comma_ they can learn to forgive you.
Aw yeah! What year are you in college?
Just make sure you focus on getting good grades!
Aw I hate to hear that. I also hope she feels better. I love my dog so much.
I hope it all turns out well with good news there!
That's amazing! Which word did he choose?
omgoodness! I don't think I've even used flamingo in a sentence myself in a long time! He's clearly a prodigy!
That's pretty neat. Did you buy anything cool?
That's so cool! Sounds like a store you would find in Daiagon Alley!
That must bring up scary memories.
I'm sorry you didn't grow out of it.
That's scary! Did you chase it away and show it who's boss?
I would have done the same. Never know if the thing is going to bite off your bellybutton or not.
Oh no! I hate when that happens! Does it still hurt?
Sorry to hear that! Definitely need to make sure it doesn't fall off!
I imagine that must have been quite a lonely experience for you. Did you see any ghosts?
Nice! What kind of pizza was it?
That's awesome_comma_ I bet she loves you just as much!
Aw_comma_ that's adorable_comma_ sounds like you guys will have a great life together!
Ewwww.  Maybe you should put them back in the oven for a bigt?
haha!  Did you just eat a bunch of mushy brownies?  
better hop on the elliptical for a little longer tomorrow!  Worth it!
Why not?
Oh no_comma_ that's awful. Maybe you can find something else to give her for her birthday but tell her you have another present that will arrive a little later. 
That's awesome! What type of work will you be doing?
Hope you enjoy it!
Wow_comma_ that's quite a feat. Did he get sick?
Yeah I'd be tempted to barf myself witnessing that.
Oh that's great! What job is it?
She must be really smart!
That would be nerve racking_comma_ but also fun I think.
Do you have a job lined up already?
Well you are ahead of the game_comma_ more so than most people.
How nice of you to loan it out! Have to admit_comma_ never heard of someone "borrowing" a lawn ornament though.
I'm glad you gave him a chance to shine! Everyone deserves a chance to be trusted_comma_ and it's good on you to roll the dice!
Uh oh_comma_ what did you do?
Ew_comma_ that does sound gross.  Was it some sort of bet or that's all you had?
Aww that's awful.  Do you have to move like for a job or something?
Oh I bet.  Make sure to hang out with as many people as you can before you leave!
Nice_comma_ how much was it worth?
Make sure to give your wife a big present when it is her birthday!
Oh yuck. Maybe it was expired then?
I hope you threw it out!
Oh what movie do you want to see?
That looks really exciting!
Yes_comma_ and you didn't have to always buy items for the extra value menu.
Those are the good old days. Have to use coupons these days!
Oh that was so close.
Maybe you will win next time!
I remember my first city apartment_comma_ the lights and sirens. It can be difficult.
I don't think they know about mufflers! You should try white noise and black out curtains.
Jeez. Was it audible? Smellable?
Whew_comma_ I would be too. God knows if she messed herself.
I would do that to.
Yeah_comma_ they should never find out.
From your house? do you have any idea who did it?
I would be furious_comma_ they are expensive now a days!
They must have been quite good.
I hope you have better control next time.
Lucky! Last flat I had was on a gravel road in the middle of nowhere_comma_lol.
My cell was out of range and it was dark out. My daughter was not happy. I am glad you got help.
That's very admirable of you. It feels like no one takes care of family anymore.
I am sure with your care_comma_ she will be much better off. I wish you and your family well.
Oh no is your dog okay?
I hope it isn't anything serious.
Hey that's sweet!  What for?
Ohh yeah!  That sounds awesome!  Is it a contest?
I am very proud of you!  Keep it up!
I wish I had your drive.
Is it for your work or part of any school projects you are having?
I admire engineering work. The true pioneers of society's good
garbage collection most important
all police not bad
Would she mind that? I wouldn't really mind that so much.
We all use a certain brand here. Now_comma_ if you used my toothbrush_comma_ that would be fighting actions!
Ah that's a pity. It really sucks to lose favorite shops.
It's like losing a family member... I hope you can find another shop like that someday.
What movie is it?
That looks like a fun movie!
What a way to wake up! That's awful_comma_ what happened?
Well_comma_ I am sorry you had to witness that. Admittedly_comma_ it 
You uttering this phrase_comma_ i remembered the Peter Griffin Meme. So tell me_comma_ what grinds your gears?
Why you guys don't you deliver a complain note to the management. They are responsible for handling the office tools
Oh no!  Why didn't you keep it in the attic or something?
Oh I see.  I bet it was a sad day then.
Is she a good driver?
I hope she is careful with it.
Congratulations_comma_ is in an area that you are interested in?
Awesome_comma_ I'm happy for you_comma_ good luck!
I am sorry. what happened to the cat?
I hope you have pet insurance_comma_ you never know what can happen.
Haha_comma_ I'm with you.  That's the worst_comma_ it almost ruins the meal.
You could_comma_ but it's always a gamble!
I am happy for you!
I hope you get married!
ok
ok carry on
That would make me angry_comma_ and it is impossible to deal with in a drive thru.
I agree. I really hate driving off only to find out a third of your order is wrong or missing!
Good thing your boss was available. I would not worry about being embarrassed. We've all done something dumb.
If he does then he isn't a very good person.
I would be pretty furious as well_comma_ those can be expensive to get removed!
I agree_comma_ some people just don't care about anyone but themselves. It's sad.
I'm good. How about you?
That sounds quite scary.
Oh dear. Did they find out about it?
Maybe one day you could repay them?
That's such a great feeling! Congratulations on all the hard work you put in paying off!
Then it sounds like you have two things going for you; an A+ and some new found confidence!
That is awesome! Do you think you are prepared?
Well that sounds like you have prepared for sure! Hope all goes well!
Yikes! that's scary_comma_ what did you do about it?
Good play_comma_ I probably would of done the same_comma_ haha.
That is so terrible!
You seem like a very good friend.
That's gonna take some time. I love their designs_comma_ but I hate the assembly!
That's really cool. Have fun building the dresser!
Oh no! What had happened?
On the bright side you can buy a new vase to replace it!
Oh what did he make you?
He sounds like a fun kid!
Ah_comma_ a plunger didn't do the trick? Hope it wasn't too expensive!
Yeah_comma_ well at least it didn't break the bank_comma_ things happen.
Oh that is sad. I hope you can spend some good time together then.
I hope you can also visit her there if you get the chance!
That's awesome. I saved up for 4 months but then had a massive car repair bill..
I know. My advice is take it seriously just in case
That's so frustrating! Do you know who it is?
Sorry to hear that. Maybe you and the other tenets can lobby for additional parking somehow?
Wow_comma_ that must have made you feel so good about yourself.
It's such a great joy to win something. I hope your luck continues.
That could be kind of scary. Have you tried to meet anyone that might could show you around and then maybe you would not be so lonely?
Well_comma_ maybe try meeting some new friends? Someone a little closer_comma_ perhaps?
Good for you! It is really dangerous to do that.
Hopefully you can teach your friend to copy your behavior!
Was it The Meg?
I can't wait to see it now!
That is so messed up.
The world is not fair.
Nice. I love donuts. Are you going to go there as soon as they open?
I haven't had any in a while_comma_ but now I suddenly want some!
Yes I agree. I love to watch them do their routines on TV.
Something about watching the world's best really keeps me interested.
Wow! How big was it? Did you smell it?
Yeah_comma_ gotta be careful and give them their space
Yikes! That made a mess I bet. Did you get burned?
Yeah_comma_ and it can stain. I drop my coffee more often than I am willing to admit.
Oh my god! That sounds terrifying
Just don't get too close! You never know what can trigger them
Me too_comma_ I'm excited for fall_comma_ I like to layer my clothes
And the snow! I'm excited to start skiing again
I would love to try them.
I really love snickerdoodles!
Don't be so hard on yourself. Some people are just naturals!
Singing is like any other skill. With time and practice_comma_ I bet you can really tune those pipes!
You should put some time aside to study.
That's a good start_comma_ just stay motivated and focus on learning everything you can. You should pass the test easily.
By who? Who are you trying to get noticed by?
Oh that's so nice! I'm sure you're a great coworker and employee
That's nice to hear! Have you treated her to something special?
Always stay faithful_comma_ it is the best thing for your relationship.
That must have been very humiliating.
I hope that never happens again.
oooh_comma_ sorry_comma_ that must have been embarrassing
take it easy_comma_ did you find your way out?
Oh no! Was it a small local place?
That's too bad_comma_ small places are usually hidden gems for food
Ouch. I actually have done that before too though... 
It's embarrassing in the moment_comma_ but I think there are more clumsy people all around us. 
jeez that sucks
what time is the trip
Oh_comma_ that is just awful. Losing someone is so hard. 
Was he ill or was it sudden? Either way_comma_ it's still painful. 
That sounds scary. What made you feel unsafe?
I would have probably felt the same way as you. How did everything turn out?
Awesome! Have you been looking forward to it?
Great! I hope you have fun and remember it for a long time
I'm sorry.  I hope you find it.
Where do you think it can be?
Oh no that sounds frustrating! I get road rage!
Yes! Whats even worse is when other people don't pay attention in bad traffic!
Wow_comma_ that is impressive!
I wish your friend could teach my dog a few tricks!
It's good to hear! Are you alright now?
Fine. Have a joyful life ahead!
A hike in your package? I'm sorry_comma_ I don't follow. As in how long it would take to get there to you?
Ohh.. I see! I'm sorry to hear that. I've never had the personal experience of having to do so_comma_ but sometimes people really have to argue and advocate for themselves to get the things they feel they've earned and deserved_comma_ like a salary raise. I hope in the future you can do that so that you can feel like you're getting what you've earned.
That sounds like it would be pretty gross.
Definitely_comma_ I'm not a super clean person but that's a bit far.
That must be a relief.
I hope you get a fresh start elsewhere!
Oh I understand_comma_ mine is only 2 1/2 right now but I feel that way too when going through his preemie clothes. You probably feel it much more if they are grown though.
Yes! Do you keep your favorite things of theirs? I always keep my favorite outfits of his and donate the rest!
What a beautiful memory tho to have! Yeah a little weird but a little cool too! 
ha ha i understand its creepy but then again my mother kept her mothers glass eyeball so i guess nothing would surprise me anymore! 
Oh no! What kind of exam was it?
I bet! What are you going to school for?
Oh_comma_ don't worry. You'll get good response. What was the email about?
Hope! you'll get a good reply!
In his work? or life?
Give him some time. I'm in counseling and it's taken about a month for it to really help.
Thats good to hear. Being independent  all your life and then being cared for all the time can be a hard transition
Hopefully this will work out well for everyone involved.
Oh I hate when that happens. Did you make it on time?
That sucks. Why did you wake up late?
That sounds so fun. What great friends!
I am sure it was a great time!
Losing weight is the best feeling. I did that a couple of summers ago.. It's one of those few things where you can visibly see yourself getting better_comma_ and there's not much that gives you as much pride as that. Congratulations!
I was proud of my mom when she started focusing more on her weight_comma_ too_comma_ just because of what you said--she's getting older. I wish she could live to 150_comma_ so anything that helps her live longer_comma_ makes me really happy. Good for you for making that choice sooner rather than later.
There is always social security and part time jobs_comma_ that seems to be the norm these days. A lot of old people do not have enough saved
I understand and i seriously think finance should be taught in school at a young age but the banks do not want that and will fight to keep that class out of schools
What place did you go to?
That makes sense_comma_ but yeah_comma_ human error is a very real thing_comma_ which is why self driving cars would probably be an improvement
Glad to hear your life took a turn. It's always weird_comma_ and even sometimes funny_comma_ to look back on your life to see where you came from_comma_ and how different and sometimes worse things were
Well_comma_ it's always so annoying in the beginning_comma_ when you know you have to change_comma_ but to see how much work there is to do in order to reach that change. It's hard for people to break things up into smaller pieces so it's not so daunting. But congratulations to you for reaching a happier place
Wow! How often do you play the lottery?
Neat! Well that is a fantastic feat. Maybe you can win again sometime?
That is awesome. How was the rest of the show?
Whoa that sounds incredible. You are very lucky to have witnessed that.
Did they go away or did you break up?
Well_comma_ remember that he is doing something healthy for himself and that should make your relationship stronger in the end.
Good mom_comma_ or dad?
I hear you :) My mom is like that. It means you're a great nurturer.
Oh man! Was it poisonous?
Hmm_comma_ what state do you live in? Although I am in Michigan and we have poisonous ones here too. I didn't even realize in MID michigan we did until I almost stepped on one..I had a panic attack too lol
Oh man..TN has water mocassins I think- Be careful!
Ah I'm sorry to hear that. Were you really busy today then?
Oh yeah I know it. I have to work remote sometimes and_comma_ depending on the mood_comma_ loneliness hits hard.
Those sound super effective. I wish I had some of them here_comma_  I have never seen mosquitoes as bad as they are this year.
I will have to look into those_comma_ they sound like a really good investment.
Oh_comma_ that's disgusting! Have you tried to talk to them about it?
Oh my god! I would contact your city or DHEC. I bet if they started to get fined they would clean it up!
Ive wanted to play the switch for so long long_comma_ I have heard such good things about it.  do you like it?
I think that is my problem with games_comma_ I dont have the time
What did you fail at exactly?
I am sorry to hear that_comma_ I hope you are able to succeed eventually!
How long did you let your hair get?
Good_comma_ I am glad you like the new change!
I understand_comma_ I have a brother as well. Do they live with you?
Oh okay thats good! Mine went across the country to college last year_comma_ so I get emotional about that. 
I hope you had something to protect you? Like  a whistle or pepper spray? 
Thank goodness the outcome was good. Everyone needs something on them to deter someone that might be wanting to harm you. 
That sounds very relaxing_comma_ what do you grow?
Wow that's quite the collection_comma_ you must be pretty experienced.
How many people are you expecting? I hope he pulls through.
Wow that sounds like a big shindig! I bet everyone is going to have a great time_comma_ good for you!
Is it a new field? How's the pay and benifits?
You could always give it a shot for a few weeks. If you don't like it_comma_ you can try for new opportunities.
Why didn't you tell your best friend?
Are you going to go out with his sister again?
I'm sorry.  I hope you find it.
You also need to cancel any credit cards.
I have no idea. As someone with loans myself_comma_ it makes me so angry thinking about how much money I've been robbed. I wasn't thinking at 18 years old_comma_ I didn't understand the amount.
No_comma_ I understand. It's really stressful and someone needs to do something about it.
Well hey_comma_ happy early birthday. I'm happy you take a positive spin on it.. I wish I could do that myself. I hate mine_comma_ always dread when it comes. Makes me feel like I haven't achieved what I would have liked to have achieved at the age I'm turning to_comma_ so I just get self-conscious about it.
That's good advice! I will try to. In general I don't like talking about myself_comma_ or having attention put on me_comma_ so that's partly the reason birthdays aren't my thing either. But it's good to have people who like theirs
I'm glad!  Anything good happening?
Lots of positives!  I'm sending good vibes your way!
Congratulations! Why are you so surprised?
Oh wow_comma_ well I'm sure he's going to be a great father! That is such amazing news!
I love pork shoulder.
I will take that offer_comma_ I could eat pork shoulder every day.
Wow_comma_ how did you afford that?
Awesome_comma_ I hope it is all worth it
Haha every character ever_comma_ right? I bet that will be fun
Yup. I heard it's all of them and it will be the biggest smash ever!
What great fun! My husband had a 1960 Ford F150 he completely redid. It was quite an attraction around town!
Nice! Where did you find it?
Even better. Are you doing all the work yourself or do you have a restoration person helping you?
That's true. You must be a very good mechanic to do all that - I know the amount of work it takes!
How do you think you did?
Well no worries then
Maybe you could take one soon.
Oh that is true_comma_ but maybe you could leave the kids home with babysitters. That does sound fun.
I would be mad as heck. Did you confront them about this behavior?
Well_comma_ I might leave him a surprise in the fridge for the next time he comes over. Some Ex-Lax chocolate pudding or something.
Is there a reason you get so emotional besides them being improtant to you?
Tell them that!
I understand that_comma_ it is not fun to not make money the way others do
Exactly_comma_ it makes being happy tough sometimes
I'm so sorry to hear that. Any news back yet on what it could be?
Excellent! Thyroid issues are easily treatable though they can be a burden to deal with. I hope you feel better as soon as possible!
That would be really scary! What do you do if they get close to your home?
I would be terrified! It sounds like you have a good system to deal with them!
lol I don't blame you. Did you end up letting her?
My mother used to do that when I was young. I hated it. hurt so bad with her long nails.
When does it come out? Sounds cool!
Oh that is a ways away! Can you preorder?
Why is that?
Oh_comma_ well if he is flirting_comma_ I would dump him
What has made it such a long  year for you?
Well_comma_ I hope you can get that stuff taken care of_comma_ I have had lots of trouble with money in my life. Takes a lot of hard work to fix it.
What did you do after you realized that?
Exercise is a good thing at least.
thats great
well you are a rare breed.
Oh_comma_ I hope it turns out ookay for you!
That was kind of you_comma_ so hopefully it does not backfire
Aw_comma_ I bet it wasn't! You must have felt terribly lonely! I'm glad you found some new friends!
That's great! Congrats to you on your new life!
That's terrible. Are you working more hours or are they cramming it into the hours you already have?
I hate when management does that. I would ask you if they are compensating you for overtime but if they're already treating you like this_comma_ then I doubt it.
Wow_comma_ wat is her degree in?
Wow_comma_ that is fantastic_comma_ good for you guys!
What system do you have?
Cool. I have an xbox one x
Why did you break up?
I would say let it go_comma_ do not bother with it
Me too! I love fall weather! 
I like that it is not too hot and not too cold.
Would've been ? I'm very sorry for you.
That's so tragic. I'm very sorry.
Maybe you should see about signing up to some sort of social group?
Yeah but_comma_ a lot of them won't come back. Once they graduate they'll move off and start their lives.
Sounds like a plan for a day off_comma_ I'd love to do that too.
We all need time to relax and recharge.
aww man. Thats a silly reason to get pulled over. Did you try to talk to the police officer about it?
You might have better luck when you go to court about it. The judge should be understanding. Its a common mistake
Oh yeah_comma_ that game looks crazy. They have a ridiculous amount of characters this time_comma_ it's great.
I heard my boy K Rool got in_comma_ that really surprised me. I haven't seen him around in forever.
That is great_comma_ I have never been fishing before
I wil give it a shot some time then!
It's amazing..the rich just think we don't have bills and needs right?
Are you moving in too another apartment or a house?
She sounds like a great mother! What kind of animals do you have?
Wow you're running a vet clinic or something haha! Well it sounds like they are surrounded with love.
Me to I love the weather in fall are you ready for fall because summer is so hot.
Yes the colors are so beautiful in the fall and I love the fashion look as well let's cheer to fall almost being here lol.
That sounds exciting and a little scary. Where are you going? 
I took a trip to europe once.  Once you get used to riding the rails and traveling around it's a blast.
Those days are they best. Are you going to run errands or just chill?
Thats awesome. Enjoy it.
I'm sorry_comma_ I've been through that too.  Were you really close?
Well_comma_ I hope you can get through it ok :)
I hope it didn't damage your house or anything on your property!
I bet_comma_ just take breaks and see if you have any friends that can lend a hand.
What makes you uncomfortable about it?
Ah_comma_ that seems reasonable_comma_ probably better to take it slowly.
What kind of stuff?
Oh nice_comma_ what kind of party?
Man that has to be a rough go.
Sometimes they enjoy being able to get around on their own even if it is dangerous.
Ugh! What a dunce! Maybe your husband should tell him. Have you told him strongly? Like..stay away from me creep?
Well that would be good for commitment etc..but not good when someone says no about something like this
Are your cats ok or are they sick?
You must be worried sick!.  I hope everything is ok.
I would've went flying if I heard that! What was it?
What a relief. That probably frightened quite a few people too. I'm glad that the response to it was prompt.
Haha oh boy toddlers_comma_ they can be a real handful! My daughter is almost 2 so I understand!
So true_comma_ they are very observant and watching/learning even when you don't realize it.
That's unfortunate :(  Would it be feasible for you to just sell your car and work with public transportation for a while until you can afford it?
Lol_comma_ that might be a bit extreme.  Maybe selling parts of your body_comma_ like plasma?
Why is it sad?
They do_comma_ but sadly that is part of life.
I know right! What shows did you watch?
I watched all of those. Clarissa explains it all_comma_ are you afraid of the dark_comma_ cousin skeeter... 
Eww. I hope he was outside - that stuff stinks!
I bet it was. Don't you just hate those eating contests where people are shoving stuff into their mouths so fast?!
No. I have to admit canned tuna is not one of my favorites. Did you watch this on TV?
I was the same way about dogs for a long time. Did something happen to make you dislike cats?
That's what happened with me and dogs. I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can find a different animal companion!
Which ivy league college?
That is a great school_comma_ what does she teach?
That sounds really pleasant. What kind of forest was it?
That sounds pretty spooky. I am glad you made it out alive.
Did they do anything like kissing?
Were you being jealous?
That's incredible. How old?
What great ages!
Okay_comma_ will it damage anything ?
Will coming out with it be as bad as if you were caught ?
Have they gotten in fights like that before_comma_ and did the police get called?
Yuck_comma_ I used to live in a rough area and that kind of thing would happen. It gets really old fast.
That is awesome. I love water parks. Do you like pools in general?
Oh yeah! It is cool here today but it has been insanely hot. Pools are the best.
Aaah_comma_ gross! I bet it smelled awful!
Garbage smell is the worst. It's like this specific sweet sick smell found nowhere else in nature.
Oh no_comma_ do you have a anxiety pill you could take to calm you down?
Bring someone with you that could be emotional support
How terrible! I'm so sorry that happened. How long ago was it?
Have you tried to find a counselor? That might help you to get through it.
Whoa. She must be feeling a lot better?
What a fantastic surprise. Hope she keeps progressing.
Oh no! That is such an inconvenience.  
Is it something you can do yourself or does it have to be done at a shop?
Why was you scared was it to dark?
Oh no you should have had someone with you that is pretty scary anything could have been out there. 
Wow_comma_ you sound really confident of that! I hope you have a backup plan in case you don't_comma_ but you must be really good at hockey.
Well_comma_ maybe I'll be seeing you on the television one day!
That is good that you want to study more.
What is your major?
What happened?
Wow! I bet that was a scary thing to experience_comma_
Oh how exciting!
I bet it will be a great time and fun!
did you say something or show up anyway?
i guess thats true
Neat! What kind of pet does your sister have?
That is so cool! What do you feed it? 
Uh oh_comma_ what has happened to it?
So what are you planning to do?
well you have to have a car though.
I'm sorry you're going through this.
I know right. Mine started yesterday
They want you to remember their last summer vacation day with you. 
I wouldnt dare home school. lol
me either. that;s no preparation for the world
So gross! I've been there. Hopefully not new shoes?
Oh geez!!! Was it in your own yard?
Congratulations! I'm sure everything will be fine!
I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ I think you have the right positive attitude though.
Congratulations what type of work will you be doing? 
You will be awesome glad it is something you are exciting about doing good luck.
Oh what is the band? Sometimes cover bands sound better! lol
lol!! That's a hysterical name! Never heard of talking heads. What genre?
Sometimes governments can be detrimental rather than helpful. What is the harassment?
That's too bad. We get a lot of gunshots here too and no one comes to help.
That's not good! Take them away_comma_ start early
No you don't have too. Little kids can just play with toys and not on video games. It's not good for them really.
Are you svaing for something particular?
Thats so true
I can imagine it was! Wow. Did you enjoy yourself tho? 
that would have been so cool! Get one next time if you can. :) 
What happened? Sometimes people are just having bad days.
Oh_comma_ I see. Were they making fun of you guys?
thats gross.
yea i wouldnt touch that no matter how much they wanted to pay me heh
Do you normally have to work on weekends? What did you do? 
Sounds like fun glad you got to do enjoy yourself 
Gaah! That's a state tax bill? That's insane_comma_ it's hard enough already to open a business.
Jesus! I hate opening my mail already because it's bills_comma_ I can't imagine trying to do something that ambitious which in of itself is a lot of work to get a business started and you have to learn so many different things_comma_ and then on top of it being sent stuff like that. Agghh! I hope it ends well for you_comma_ though.
I can't imagine! I have a hard time sitting for long hours too. What are you looking in too?
Thats a job that is needed for sure. You could also try and get a degree in programming- it usually only takes a year? So many things you can do. Also look into selling online. It's a great business if you stay on top of it daily :)
Never heard of such a thing. Is it outdoors?
True_comma_ is it a fun place too go?
Did they pick it back up?
Maybe they just don't notice it.
oh that is cool_comma_ did it bring back some memories as well?
thats good
That sucks. Are there any cameras in the parking lot?
Some people have no integrity....
Oh? Did someone leave it open_comma_ or did someone break in?
Oh no! I hope you find him
how many fingers have they lost?
now that is impressive
call the po-po.
spray the hose in that direction to get the tv wet.
Oh no! What happened?
I would have been terrified! What did you do?
Oh poor thing!  What did you do?
Yay!  I had a little box turtle when I was younger_comma_ I liked her a lot.  I hope Mrs. Lee has a long and happy (and not thirsty :)) life with you!
What all do you have to get done?
What all do you have to get done?
Phew_comma_ that sounds like a lot of work! You better start getting on that_comma_ then!
It is scary yet exhilarating lol
Some don't like them. I can't do the ones that go straight down.
Oh wow_comma_ congratulations! I'm guessing you weren't expecting?
I'm so glad! When are you due?
Oh yeah why is that? Did the cops drag you out? 
hahah stripped sounded so much better but okay tripped! I gotcha 
Thats a big accomplishment. 
Next thing you know she will be walking. 
Weekends off are always great.  What did you do with your time?
Sounds fun.  I hope you had a good time!
That's a lot of dedication. Was it for a special occasion? And have you been baking for very long_comma_ or do you do it professionally at all?
Oh_comma_ I feel terrible for both of you. Your hard work lost_comma_ and she probably feels really guilty too_comma_ for something that was maybe an accident. I hope you guys were able to talk it out and not get too upset with one another after a while.
As long as otherdays you are eating healthy I think its fine to cheat once in awhile
Just hit the gym as soon as you can and you will feel better!
Who hasn't that happened to before! If it took you that long to notice_comma_ I bet no one else noticed. Were you able to fix it later?
Yeah_comma_ I can understand how you would feel embarrassed there. It sounds like it didn't lead to anything too bad though_comma_ so maybe most people don't remember it happened at this point.
I love the feeling a rollercoaster gives. Have you gone before?
Yes the juice is certainly worth the squeeze
Good for you! what are you planning to spend it on?
Enjoy it! You deserved it :) I hope you will get more checks like that 
that's wonderful! I go to church every sabbath
i agree with you! I don't know what i would do without God. 
I am sure he has heard it before!
You were just in the moment_comma_ I bet it wont happen again
A three pound burger?!? That's crazy_comma_ I could never eat one of those in one sitting.
Wow. I bet that's going to hurt him later_comma_ though.
Did you travel for work or for vacation?
Its too soon to be homesick!
That is awesome. You sound confident.
Good for you. Good luck. Just remember to have a good time and you will be fine. 
That's too bad. Do you mow a lot?
Absolutely. There are things far more important than lawn length.
And how does that make you feel?
What is she going to school for?
well what are some things that are bad from him
ohh i mean maybe you can go and give it a try and see how he does
Your company left you alone? In what way? That does sound like a troubling situation.
Oh_comma_ I see. That makes a little more sense. Did everything work out_comma_ or are they still gone?
What is your character?
Cool_comma_ well have a good time theifing!
I just love Fall! I'm guessing that's your favorite season?
I feel you. Watching the leaves change colors makes me feel peaceful.
awh that does sweet of you_comma_ what kind of pet is it? 
ive always wanted one of those but to be honest i would be afraid lol 
where were they
oh that was nice
I know how you feel I can be lonely sometimes. 
I recommend taking some time to explore the city and find an hobby or interest and join some groups. It takes time to find a new set of friends.
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that! 
Hopefully something similar will come up soon. Maybe you can check for another position in the company you're hoping for!
did you get it dismissed?
thats the law!
Maybe he was upset with you.
Then you'd get in lots of trouble as most places have laws that your dog can't be on the loose
Whoa what a great surprise. Congratulations.
I am sure you deserve it. That is fantastic.
Long trip. How can you afford it?
Okay_comma_ I get it. Ever seen the movie "Hostel"?
Are you alright?
Is it physical? If you need anything let me know.
Does it work for good luck?
I understand. Is it a very nice watch?
did you make it ?
sounds like the start of a business
That's wonderful. Always nice to take some time for the self_comma_ especially with PTO.
Make sure to enjoy it to the fullest.
Yikes. Did you ever find the spider?
I think its time to invest in a can of bug spray
If you kno
Leaving family at home?
Behave on your vacation :)
That's so awesome! What a huge relief that must be. 
Keep focused! You can do it! Being debt free is an amazing feeling!
good memories ?
thats always good 
Did you have some special plans for the weekend that you couldnt go do? 
Well hopefully you can go soon 
what do you do ?
that sounds interesting
What is going on next week?
That is awesome. Kids here start tomorrow so I know the feeling of being ready for them to go!
I wouldn't want to do that.
It's just not worth it.
why is that
i agree with you there.
How nice of him!! you should be thankful to him!!
now how nice of you!! thats what  are friends for. I Hope you will get a job and your friend will get a gift!!
Very nice. I am sure you deserve it.
Good for you. Buy yourself something special.
I am sure it is a bittersweet moment.  I can relate myself.  It takes some getting used to
You will still have plenty of time before your son becomes an unruly teenager.  Cherish it.
Oh yeah that's couldn't have been good!
Most definitely! would you say you live in a good neighborhood?
Hey it's a win win! You get the nice points and she gets her lunch! 
I bet she loves you for it either way! It doesn't matter how little the effort was_comma_ it matters if it was nice! 
I'll bet it was! That must have been an enormous burger!
Haha! I'd need a lot more than a free tshirt to eat a 3 pound burger!
did you beat her down ?
im sure it will make you feel better.
 I was late to an appointment recently because I got stuck in a traffic jam. 
That's so annoying. Maybe you should leave earlier next time
What kind of prank did he pull on you?
Well_comma_ what kind of prank was it?
how soon after did the beatdown come ?
thats what im talking about!
Did you talk to your boss?
That's awful_comma_ what did you want to do?
That's such a shame. Could you perhaps join them for a couple of days?
Yeah. Oh to be a kid again and not have to deal with all that! So sorry you're going to miss time with your family. Hopefully they'll take lots of photos!
what ended up happening?
oh well good luck
Oh no_comma_ did they leave a note?
What a jerk_comma_ I'm sorry that happened.
That sounds pretty awesome. How long until you get off from work?
hahaha hope you have fun!
Did someone give you a recipe or did you google it? Keep tasting it until you get what you want! 
As long as it has good reviews_comma_ make sure you put a little squeeze of lime in it at the end. It really brings out the flavor. right before you serve it tho. 
I love ramen! not the healthiest food in the world but tastes good and hits the spot
my mom doesn't lol but she is crazy about healthy vegetarian food _comma_so :)
Exciting_comma_ is it hazardous scary or more excited scary?
Well_comma_ go in with an open mind and maybe your experience will be different. And be sure you pay attention to the safety requirement!
Chemicals mean serious business_comma_ but you landed the job. Good luck with doing well.
Ahhh i bet your nerves are thru the roof. Whens the test date? 
I wish you a lot of luck_comma_ and try not to let it get the best of you ( way easy to say... way hard to actually do. i know ) 
Have you asked the merchant why it is late?
I would be too! They should be more diligent with their shipping estimates!
What field are you in?
That is awesome_comma_ I hope it goes well
Did you ever get cheated on?
Well that is good for you then!
Is Fall your favorite season?
Summer is my favorite because it means vacation!
Did you stop to help him?
We've all been there...at least I have.
Oh wow_comma_ is he flirting with her? Does he know she is a relationship with you?
I would defenitly just have her block the number_comma_ so he gets the message. 
Nice! What will you be doing?
Nothing to be nervous about_comma_ I'm sure you'll do fine!
i know i am really exited_comma_ what do you have planned?
that is what i love the most about Thanksgiving the food is always the best
That is so awesome_comma_ have you been accepted yet/
I hope you do too! Applying is a huge step in the right direction!
Any damage to where you live ?
I hope you can get it all cleaned up without too much trouble.
Probably once or twice in my life_comma_ but I dont go anywhere alone so... :/ 
That is really crappy_comma_ i think whatever makes you feel that way you should try to figure it out and battle it! You deserve to be happy all the time. 
That would be annoying.
That would be bothersome_comma_ especially if it's taking away from your time.
That is always fun to do.  What did you get yourself?
That is very cool.   I like tech that is practical but also fun to use.  
Do you know what their names will be?
Have you had any kids yet?
Oh that's wonderful twins seem really cool.
Congrats_comma_ I've heard that many twins have a special bond so I hope they have that and do well.
Yikes_comma_ were you able to clean it up?
That sounds like it would do the trick. Hopefully his couch is okay.
What did you guys eat?
lol_comma_ did you tell your friend about the hair?
What contest is that?
I hope you win!
Congratulations! That's a very good job. What kind of food do you prepare?
Well they must think a lot of your abilities to promote you like that. I love Mexican food_comma_ btw :)
I love it when managers actually pay attention. Makes the job so much easier and more pleasant. Good for you.
No_comma_ it wasn't you_comma_ obviously. Your previous manager sounds like a control freak!
How long has it been since you have gotten a raise?
Did you talk to your manager?
Not worth the risk is it ?
Okay_comma_ you know you can buy them too. And somebody lost for your gain.
Oh no! Is he/she okay? 
Blood makes me freak out too. That is pretty scary! I'm glad they are okay.
Seriously?  What was going on?
Oh that's awful. I am glad you and your stuff is okay though!
That is such an exciting time and really nice of everyone to do that.
That also helps relieve some stress off of you trying to get everything ready by yourselves.
That sounds nice_comma_ how long has it been
It will feel like old times for sure
Wow_comma_ great! you must be so proud!
Of course_comma_  that is fantastic!  Congratu;e him from me.
Congratulations! You must be very proud of her. What kind of recital was it?
I bet! It takes quite a level of talent and composure to perform publicly like that. Kudos to your daughter!
Could you call people?
Yes meet new people!
that is lucky do you talk much in class?
well you probably should start paying much attetion if you dont want to risk it
Its good that you like it so much. Why are you worried that it will close?
Oh_comma_ I understand. Maybe they make up for it on busy days_comma_ like weekends.I hope they stay open so you can continue to enjoy their food.
Oh no_comma_ did anyone see
Thats unfortunate_comma_ I am sure they will forget
I'm so sorry to hear that. Were you able to be there when she passed?
Sometimes you don't know when they'll pass unfortunately. I hope you take some time to grive.
How was the service?
Did you put any money in the collection pot?
Did you dig it out of the trash?
Did you cry yourself to sleep that night?
That's a great surprise!
That's really nice. I hope it was a big raise!
Im sorry to hear that? Is it a bad cold?
That's good to hear. But kids can be a handful when they are sick.
I bet that's super awesome! Is it really comfortable? 
Oh man_comma_ I would fall asleep in that
That is never a good feeling
Do you have some bills that you can put off until later?
Will you go again?
I can understand that for sure.
Sounds like a fun thing to do. What kind of racing did you see?
Oh_comma_ I've never seen that. It sounds amazing! If they're anything like the F1 drivers they'll be incredible!
Yes! I love Halloween. I need to start making plans myself.
That's awesome_comma_ I hope he enjoys it too!
That was really nice of them! I'm glad you got some help
Amazing! That had to be really stressful too though
that is not good_comma_ do you have any idea why you spaced out
dont worry about it it happens to everyone it is nothing to be ashamed of
Are you one of the Uber drivers?
Did they apologize to you?
That's a special moment. To hopefully see your kids doing better than you and all that jazz. I'm in college but my parents live only a couple hours away_comma_ so I just visit them instead_comma_ since them coming to me wouldnt be anything too special. But congratulations to you and your kid
That's awesome that he is helping to break the mold then. Says just as much about him as it does about you_comma_ though. Takes good parenting to get him to that level of motivation
It's great to hear that you're in such good shape! I need to work on that myself.
Yeah_comma_ I wasn't careful about what I ate when I was younger_comma_ and I'm really paying for it now. Hopefully they can get back in shape too.
That is a nice way to remember him. Its good that you have something of his to keep his memory alive.
I'm sure that's an awesome feeling. 
Yeah_comma_ don't be too hard on yourself for that. We're supposed to like that stuff.
I see. You'll find balance along the way though.
I used to be that way_comma_ because I love holidays and the mood it puts everyone in. But I'm starting to hate how short the fall and winter days are_comma_ and how quickly it gets dark. Now that I've been exercising outside more lately_comma_ I hate losing that time in the sun
I can understand that. And I live in the south_comma_ so it doesn't get that cold_comma_ so I can't really complain. I visited my girlfriend who lives in the midwest last winter_comma_ and it got under 0 at times. I could not live like that long term.
That must have been painful and a little embarrassing!
Probably they just fell bad for you_comma_ thank god it was not worse.
Yikes. I live in the south and we don't get those. Just palmetto bugs (flying roaches). I think I'd rather have those than rats_comma_ personally.
My girlfriend has complained about rats too_comma_ since she lives in the midwest. Says she'll be taking out the trash and she'll hear them scurrying and it will freak her out. Good luck to you guys who have to deal with the little disease-infested things..
I'm so proud of you! That's a lot to deal with all at once! 
It's worth it! It'll teach you a lot that you'll use later in life 
That's very sad. My Grandma had that and it is devastating to experience it. I'm told that doing puzzles etc. keeps the brain active and maybe at least delays it.
I really feel for you. It's not easy_comma_ I won't kid you. But at least you understand what's happening and are obviously prepared for the inevitable.
I hear you there_comma_ it can be more relaxing spending time at home thang going to a hectic party. 
Will your friend be disappointed with you?
I would be so excited! I'm so proud of you! 
Hopefully you have some wine to celebrate with! 
that's annoying. maybe you should try giving them a call again?
i completely understand_comma_ i hope they will call you soon so you won't have to
Oh. Do you have to buy a lot of presents or do you just not know what to buy?
I understand. You know there are websites were you can answer a few questions about the person you are buy a gift for and then it makes gift recommendations for that person.
Yeah_comma_ I have tried it a few times. It suggests some pretty cool things too.
Oh wow! That usually doesn't happy_comma_ usually that feeling fades with time. 
It sounds like you have a keep of a place to go!
Wow that's awesome. You must be feeling pretty content.
You did things right. You will be able to retire one day on your current track.
That's pretty cool to hear. When I have kids_comma_ I hope they're the same_comma_ and can get into sports_comma_ since it offers so much. Good for you for getting them into sports
It'd be cool if she made it to the stage where she could play the World Cup.. I feel like that's such a cool sporting event_comma_ and if you had your child in that_comma_ that'd create some kind of family legacy.
Did you bring it in and take care of it?
That's very kind of you. Too often people neglect stray animals and they suffer terrible short lives.
Did the neighbors come after you?
Maybe or at least recovered your basketball!
Tell him you had to go to the store!
How nice! Are you going out or are you going to have a nice night in?
Thats great. I hope you both enjoy yourselves.
Congratulations! I am sure you are very happy and beeming with pride right now. Whats the next step for her?
Excellent! Any scholarships in the future?
How scary!  I hope your neighbors are ok.
That is great_comma_ at least there was something positive!
Awesome_comma_ what kind of restaurant is it?
I love thai food_comma_ I can see why it made you feel good!
Oh wow a wonderful surprise indeed!
Yes it's always good to have family!
That's really cool. Did it bring back good memories?
I'm very sorry for your loss. I'm glad you have the letter from him though.
I guarantee you know more than you think! Just be methodical and you'll do just fine.
Everyone needs a math genius friend_comma_ lol. At least_comma_ you do if you're as hopeless at math as I am!
oh im so sorry you felt this way! I hope your mood will get better. maybe watch a good comedy?
i understand how you feel though. i would feel lonely but i would definitely do something fun like play video games or watch movie
That's terrible.. There's nothing more frustrating and deflating in life than unexpected expenses. I hope you're able to cover all of it. I know if I had one right now_comma_ I might not be able to manage it.
I hope you can. If you think there's even a chance_comma_ then give it a shot_comma_ if it will save you that much money. My brother watches Youtube videos all the time of how to fix random things_comma_ and it seems to work for him. If you're the type of person that can learn that way_comma_ and if you have the patience_comma_ then I think it's a good thing to try.
What was she so negative?
What kind of dog is it?
Oh that's terrible_comma_ getting delayed always annoys me
Oh yes that sounds a little dangerous I wouldn't take that flight unless it was necessary. 
That sounds so nice! I love to be with my dog outside too_comma_ even if just watching him play.
Yes!v and a good exercise too!
that's great_comma_ what did you have for lunch? i had some hot dogs and baked beans
i love chicken alfredo! so delicious. I wish i could nap too lol i'm a mom_comma_ moms don't nap
How did you like it? Did it give an energy boost?
Wow_comma_ so it definitely made a difference. I bet you will be drinking more then.
You know there is one thing that might make it even better.
Yea_comma_ but have you ever experienced wings before?
I wish i could go to my old high school. i moved far from it but if i come back i will visit
i bet! High school was fun. We couldn't wait to become adults lol
Ewww. I hate it when dog owners don't pick up after their pets. We always carried a poop bag with us for when our pooch "went".
No_comma_ they're not_comma_ and it's not just in this country. Europe is terrible for dog poo in the streets!
Thats amazing! he must really really love you.
Well atleast he did what he could to show you he cares.
That's pretty gross. Were there other people around? I'm always more nervous about that when people are around.
That sounds horrifying. Pretty sure I would die.
Haha oh no. Sometimes you need a cheat day.
Maybe next time have a huge meal before you start baking. That way you arent hungry. 
It's good to be confident. I am sure you will get some good news soon.
You did great. Just wait and don't stress about it.
Wow! Was your order important? Have you called the post office to find out what happened?
Well that's good. I hope her makes it before the end of the day and you get your package.
Awe! Hopefully they were cute pictures
Growing up sucks! Lmao
Congratulations! It's not easy moving to a new place_comma_ but it's great fun getting to know your new home!
That takes a lot of courage. I'm proud of you! I moved last year and it's both fun and scary at the same time
Did you wind up eating it?
lol_comma_ you are such a nice person. I would have definately kicked that guy out!
Happy early birthday! Do you have any plans?
That's a great plan. I hope your wife makes it happen!
That is terrifying_comma_ did you get away from it?
That is good_comma_ who knows if the dog has rabies or not. It would be unpleasant to get bit! 
Have you been expecting it long? 
Oh no!! I hope it comes soon. I know how that it to be waiting for money to come. 
You dont like to gossip at all?
I understadn that_comma_ Others business is a very sensitive subject
Is this brother of your's a lot younger than you are?
Would you say your relationship is like the one in that movie_comma_ Brother Bear?
What What_comma_ tell me?
what were some of your favorites?
You must miss her. But I'm sure she'll be back before you know it!
She must like to travel. Have you ever gone with her?
Well thats disappointing. Maybe you can find a show similar to it to watch. 
I know what you mean. It seems they keep the crap shows going for years and the good ones get cancelled. 
Did you flip the bird? Some people are so rude.
You should also post the license plate on social media. Sometimes public shaming does wonders.
Well it's a teacher's goal to make sure his or her students succeed.  She wants you to do your best.
It's always good when you have a teacher who cares and puts forth the effort to help you as much as possible.
Must feel good to get it over with. How do you think you did?
That is great. You must have been very confident up there.
Yes! I bet it will_comma_ did you go in and kill it?
What is the job_comma_ will you like it?
Thats amazing_comma_ I have actually had that happen to be before in my life_comma_ I was so happy
Thats right_comma_ taht makes me so happy to know
What did you fail?
How many times have you tried?
I almost feel like homework is counter productive. Shouldn't the schools be teaching the kids enough during their 8 hours?
I guess you're right. Education isn't something that can be rushed! But still_comma_ I think homework is a little excessive.
I'm sure there'll be other games it will be useful for.
I built my own too a few years ago.
At times_comma_ though I don't have as much time anymore.
That's a shame_comma_ do you have anything else lined up?
There'll probably be something else
Is that a bad thing?
That's good
Oh that cinnabon smell can be so enticing!
That sounds so good. I haven't had one in forever.
Oh man! I would be so excited! When do you go?
Man that's going to be so awesome! 
Talk crap get smacked
Is this a true story
mcdonalds is honestly gross to me though_comma_ rich or poor. i dont eat it.
Thatnks_comma_ just a matter of preference I guess.
oh my god_comma_ thats it so gross_comma_ cat pee is the worst.
im so sorry_comma_  thats why im not the biggest fan of animals.
That sounds like quite a ride. Are you a fan of rollercoasters in general?
I understand that. I hate rollercoasters too.
That is great to hear. Anything new going on?
I wish I were so content. Must be a nice feeling.
Did it do much damage to your car ?
Well_comma_ I hope they had insurance at least.
Dang_comma_ that really blows. What was it made of_comma_ glass?
They should use metal. That never breaks. Sorry that happened to you.
Did you get up to go check to see what it was?
Thats absoulty terrifying to be honest.
How long did it take? 
Doesn't sound too bad
That's awesome. What band is it?
Never heard of it. I hope it was a good show!
It's hard for kids to do that. Maybe he was just bored?
It's hard for kids to do that. Maybe he was just bored?
Thats a nice feeling to have job security. Do you enjoy your work?
Well sometimes you have to leave comfort behind and take a chance doing something you like. 
What did you hear?
That is so scary! I'm glad you're okay!
That's great!  Have you had good things happen?
Awesome_comma_ I'm happy for you!
It sounds you you didnt leave anything out. It feels good to bell prepared.
That is great especially in a time like going to the hospital.
That's really awesome! I never win anything either...
Well congratulations! I hope you spend it on something good for yourself!
that's great! congrats! I'm glad to hear that. you deserved it
you should go celebrate with your other half and your friends!
Me either. ITs too much
Same here. Picnics and family time
That's good. What have they done for you ?
How long do you think that it will take.
Oh no! Did you scold the dog?
I hope he doesn't get that one!
Its really good that you have friends like that. I'm sure they realize that you are just joking with them!
I wish I had such good friends like you do!
That's great.  What kind of work do you do
well you must have good social skills then
That sounds so good!
Oh no_comma_ I bet she ends up loving it!  Best of luck!
Oh nice!  What kind of phone did you get?
Think of all the mindless browsing you can do now!
Oh_comma_ now that's exciting! Do you have any plans to do it? Celebrating with anyone?
That's wonderful! I'm happy for you. Hopefully he got you something meaningful_comma_ sentimental_comma_ and long-lasting so that you can keep on enjoying it!
Honestly that will end up being a lot better in the long run anyway_comma_ won't it? More memorable to know he really spent time and effort getting something for you.
oh man_comma_ sorry to hear that. i mean good for your friend but i feel you. i never win anything
maybe one day we will win really big! who knows
a backed old man?
Hahaha yeah_comma_ that kinda sucks
That's really cool. What is your idea?
That sounds like a really cool idea. I hope that it turns out well!
That is really kind of you_comma_ many people would not bother. I hope that she wins her battle.
Chemotherapy and radiation can really take their toll. There is a program through the cancer society that does a day of beauty with cancer patients. They give them a makeover_comma_ giftbags_comma_ wigs if needed.
That is excellent_comma_ and you are a truly giving person. I wish her the best.
Why's that? 
I'd imagine it feels pretty nostalgic
Oh no! If it helps they probably don't remember. That stuff filters out faster than you would think!
Well_comma_ I feel for ya! I'm a very clumsy person myself_comma_ trip all the time.
Im sure they understand. That is a tough position to be in.
Maybe try and reach out on social media to a few of them. Im sure they would love to hear from you.
Did he hurt the baby? Most of the time they are just curious 
Yeah_comma_ that's what they do. Hahaha
Aww_comma_ did you take it home with you? It's great to adopt strays.
Then I am sure the cat is yours. Enjoy your ball of fur!
I totally understand that feeling. It's very frustrating. All you can do is try your best and try not to pay too much attention to that aspect.
I think we all have our good days and bad days. Just keeping plugging along and I bet it gets better soon. It recently did for me.
That sucks.
I know how you feel. Keep your head up. Start putting out more applicaitons.
Oh that is the best. Did you buy anything?
Perfect. Must have been a nice surprise.
Do it! She may say yes!
Good! The sooner the better!'
Wow_comma_ thats really lucky of you.  Its good to find nice people out there
Good thing you found that guy and not someone else
Was it good?
Cool! There isn't anything like that around where I live
About what?
How did it go? S[eeches can be intimidating
Weel thats good
That's great you have such great friends!
Well he checks all of the boxes doesn't he!
Oh man that's a bummer.  Did you leave her or are you giving her another shot
Dang that's harsh homie...so sorry to hear that bud.  Don't worry as much as it hurts now she did you the favor of kicking herself out of your life...you deserve better than her 
A RAT! I would have died
You should get traps. You may have scared it away. I think only mice get scared though. Rats are like dinosaur mice
That is nice of you. I hope he appreciated it.
Well I am sure he will appreciate the effort even if it doesn't come out great. You are being thoughtful.
That's sad. What happened?
That's so bad. I don't have any pets
Oh I love vacations! Do you love the water?
It's beautiful I'm sure you'll have tons of fun.
You must be very proud. That is awesome.
Hopefully he keeps up. Im sure he has a great attitude.
That's wonderful!
That shows how lucky you can be!
Oh no! I hope that you were able to get someone to fix it!
Probably a good idea!
Oh no_comma_ I'm so sorry to hear that. My cat is getting old_comma_ she's 15. I'm scared she'll pass soon too
That's so sad. I hope you feel better soon. I would be so devastated too.
Sometimes it can be difficult to get your footing when starting out. It sounds like you enjoy your life now and have something to be proud of.
That is all that people can expect of you_comma_ that you try to be the best you possible_comma_ each and every day.
That's... exciting..
Wow that's awesome.
That really sucks_comma_ I've had that happen to me as well.
I agree_comma_ most don't bother with something so simple like throwing away trash or returning grocery carts or holding open doors.
That really stinks. Maybe you should try and find something that your good at and do that!
What do you think you are really good?
Cool! Did you go to Greece for vacation?
Sounds awesome_comma_ I've never been to Europe
That's awesome. I hope that it goes well!
Do you feel confident in you did on your finals?
I am so happy for you. Doe she make you feel special?
That is awesome. Everyone wishes to find someone like that.
What did he do to inspire such pride
Nice. That is pretty awesome
Wow thats really impressive.  Well I need to be open.  Flow to me money_comma_ flow to me...
$1 Billion come to me.  Im ready to recieve you
Oh that sounds great_comma_ I hope you get it!
So exciting! Are you happy to move to a new job?
Maybe she will let you borrow it. Or maybe if she gets a new one she will give it to you.
That's way too expensive for a bag. What is it made of_comma_ gold? Haha.
You got an awesome girlfriend. Who are you going to see?
She sure surprised you. I hope you have a great time at the concert.
Whoa that is out there. Takes some real confidence to rock that.
Yea that is true. I hate that.
I know the feeling too. I'm a 1000 miles from my family. 
Yeah same to you. I'm counting down the days until I get to see them again. 
In 57 days according to my coutdown!
oh my goodness. that is crazy. i've never had anything like that happen.
that's amazing. what are you going to do with your amazing gift?
Oh yeah?  How did that go? 
Yep that happens lots of times but_comma_ I don't think we're supposed to talk about the elephant in the room per the instructions..
That sucks.  Did they give a reason?
Well maybe you can complain and get some money back or something?
Yikes_comma_ you gotta pay more attention to your textbook maybe
I hope you do well and pass the exam!
That's too bad. Maybe you can call them?
I hear you. Just think in the old days you would have to write letters_comma_ lol.
Yikes_comma_ that's really cruel of him to do that. I'm sure you're trying the best you can
Don't mind them_comma_ everyone has a tough time everynow and then. You'll be okay
Wow_comma_ that is nice. What does he understand?
That is cool.
Who left all the dirty dishes?
Does she have a job?
Good for you_comma_ have a beer for me!
Dang_comma_ I'm seriously about to go get one now you made me jealous.  Not even lying.
It's always good when a friend meets his potential
You got to stay focused and make that money. Don't want the world to pass you by
oh my goodness that is horrible. how come it didn't recognize you?
awww that is so sad. i hope it recognizes you after some time together.
What's wrong? What are you visiting the doctor for?
Yes_comma_ definitely get a blood test so you know what you need to watch out for
Oh no! before he got to have it?
Oh ok_comma_ thats not as bad.  I thought it was before he got a chance to blow out the candles
Why_comma_ did someone cancel on you?
Oh_comma_ well it'll come in soon enough_comma_ you can look forward to it next weekend
What was high school like for you?
Oh_comma_ that's awful. I'm really sorry. So do the songs bring back bad memories?
That's great! How far along is she?
Hahaha_comma_ sounds like a great time_comma_ you should prepare some games to play at the party
That is infuriating. I dont see how some people are so unaware.
I feel you. Some people just suck.
Oh nice. Any big plans for it?
That's awesome. The beach is always a good time_comma_ especially when the weather is nice!
That's sad_comma_ how old was your pet izzy
All iguana's go to heaven so I'm sure he is
Well that's quite the accomplishment! How did you train her?
Aha of course_comma_ the oldest operant conditioning trick in the book. I love it!
Sorry to hear that.  You get it fixed already or what
It's good to have reliable friends.
Awesome.  Sounds like you are defintely on top of the world today!
What kind of money we talking?  Lottery money?
Oh my! I hope that it goes well!
I'm sure it will be ok. It's probably nothing. 
oh how exciting. what grade was it from?
that is so sweet. it would be fun if you have children so you can share it with them.
What is the longest you have been apart?
Yea that will be a little lonely for sure. Just try and stay productive as much as possible.
Wow_comma_ that must be exciting. Do you have everything prepared?
Nice! Make sure to take lots of photos and make some cool memories together!
Whoa_comma_ that is quite the confession. But you know_comma_ it's good that you recognize that you need to change a behavior. Very mature. Not everyone has that same ability to be honest with themselves_comma_ and you should feel proud about that!
I know_comma_ and I know it can be really hard to deal with that guilt. You want to solve the problem though_comma_ and that's still worth something. Being able to take the little victories will go a long way toward the goal you want in terms of how you treat your husband.
I've always gone by if you learned from your mistakes you have no reason to regret them
It's good you've grown and learned. Never stop 
Oh that is awful. I have been fired before it is just the worst. Have things gotten better since then?
It defintiely sounds bad.
That is good. Is it your manager who did the review?
I understand.
i hate when that happens. my dreams are always so vivid they feel real.
oh my word. that is like a nightmare not a bad dream.
i'm so sorry you had to go thru that.
Oh no I hope everything goes well!
Well I hope that it all goes your way!
Do you live on a farm? It will probably be nice to move to a city and get away from those chickens.
What are you going to do with the chickens?
do you do it out of necessity or because of the thrill of it?
how about you get some of the same food for yourself?
Why is that?
I don't think that being bossy. You are just really concerned with getting a job done efficiently 
What games did you liked?
I like a lot COD. It is one of my favorites.
Just wear cologne_comma_ dress sharp_comma_ use mouthwash_comma_ and let her do all the talking.  And you'll be just fine
That's good.  Just stay away from the beans and spicy food haha
That sounds awesome! I wish I could go!
That sounds like a really good time. It will be like you are a kid again!
Aw I am sorry to hear that. I'm sure he was a good pet.
Oh wow. Pets can be just like family members. It's hard to lose them I know.
Why? What are you worried about?
Just try to relax and not worry so much. Yes something bad could happen but there's also a chance nothing goes wrong. Having anxiety about something can be hard to overcome but you can do it :)
I loved playing that!  They look so outdated now.  Good times!
That must have been the most epic Christmas ever!  I think someone gave us ours but I can't remember.  Makes me want to play now!
Whoa congrats. You must be very excited.
That is so awesome. Im sure it will be a very fun day to share with everyone.
oh my goodness that is horrid. i'd think with hot water and degreaser.
haha. you are very welsome. that's what happens after years of dirty microwave cleaning.
Oh wow where are they?
Why are they in a  place so far away from you? Are you away at college?
Oh no! I'm so sorry are you going to be alright?
Oh god I'm so sorry for you! I hope everything goes well
I would be afraid one of them would get out!
Have you held any of your friend's spiders?
That sounds like it could be a great success.  Do you both work well together?
I hope its a major triumph for you both!  
Nice how old are they
Nice you seem pretty open minded about so I'm sure you'll handle yourself well.
oh_comma_ thats embarassing.  I hate it when that happens.   
haha_comma_ well maybe they didn't want to embarass you.
Ew_comma_ yeah it is not worth risking getting food poisoning!
Yes_comma_ need to check those sell by dates. Meat may only be good for a few days afterwards.
Oh no! Have you already had some tests or is this the first time?
I'm so sorry to hear. What is the problem?
Ah ok_comma_ yeah my partner has had similar issues recently. I really hope it all works out for you!
That is so exciting_comma_ how long do you have to wait tell you find out if you are accepted or not?
I am sure you have worked very hard to get to this place! 
That is great news!  I am sure he feels a great deal of accomplisment
I hope he enjoys his new job and can celebrate
That sounds so annoying!
I hope they finish up soon. That could drive someone crazy going on for so long.
Really? How come?
That is very disappointing. Maybe next time text or talk on the phone a little bit to see if you will have something in common.
How old are you?
Ah ok_comma_ it is fine
Oh no! What do you think had happened or triggered it?
Hope she recovers and feels better overall soon. That can be quite the scare!
They are really impressive.  What circus was it?
Have you ever gotten to go to a Cirque du Soliel?  If you like acrobats you would love that!
Did you call the police?
I suggest a Night Owl surveillance system.
That's the worst. I have that happen all the time but with onions.  Its the only thing they have to do so get it right!
Did you have them get you a new one plus give you your money back for having to taste that nastiness?
Why would you be worried? Do you have three arms?
Sounds to me like you need to build your self-confidence a bit more.
how come. is their something wrong with it?
oh my goodness. is that not covered by the water company since it's technically their meter?
I hope they come back with the desired result.  Good luck
Nice do you mind sharing what it was...my mom had a cyst in her ovaries but it ended up being benign
Oh I feel you! I have full control over my schedule_comma_ it is so nice!
Part time self employed and part time just employed by a company. The company lets me choose my shifts though so... still full control.
oh wow_comma_ that does suck! Hopefully you can push it to another day this week.
Defenitly_comma_ and employers can be unreasonable sometimes.
Thats awesome what kind of car is it.
have you always wanted a jeep they seem pretty fun to drive.
Did the entire class laugh at you?
I haven't peed my pants ever. Guess I am just lucky.
Why did your dog do it.
My Japanese spitz did that once...lady was waving a bone around and pulling back...til he caught her with one snap and almost bit her finger clean off
You must be a little jealous.  Maybe its time to save up for your own dream car?
I mean pro's and con's... right?
Oh no!  That is disappointing.  Did you have to run out and get more?
Well_comma_ I guess one night without beer is not going to kill you.  
Oh boy I hope you get some sleep tonight!
you got it bro!
Did you know all the answers?  I wouldn't be too good at it.
Wow_comma_ impressive!  I'd have to get some category like Kids or Nutrition to know much of anything. ha ha
That is awful_comma_ those movies are pretty good minus the george clooney and ben afflack films.
You need to go see them and overcome your fear of bats
I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ hopefully you qualify for unemployment while you get back on your feet.
Are you in a right to work state? Here in my state they don't have to have a reason.
Oh no! I have the same problem at my work! How do you deal with it?
Yeah it can be hard. I resorted to wearing noise cancelling headphones myself!
I'm sure it'll go fine! Are you doing okay?
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope the doctor can give you some treatment options. 
Now that's quite a gift! Are you going to take her to any games as a thank you?
I've been looking forward to it starting too. Not a lot going on at the moment. But that's wonderful to hear!
What happens next.
Well I guess it worked itself out. 
I undersand. Do you want to strangle me?
Good.
How come?
That does sound scary.  I would have used my phone flashlight
brought back some old memories?
thats nice
That was nice of you to help them.  What did you do to help?
Wow_comma_ that sounds really complicated.  I could never do that.  Id send you a thank you card too
What talents do you speak of?
That's pretty cool.   Do you go to the circus often?
That's amazing to hear.  There is nothing like a great relationship!
Bad ones definatley make the good one a treasure.  Have you been together long?
That is a good long time!  I am sure you have many more ahead of you!
When you appreciate something that much it's sure to continue that way!  I've been married 19 years and love almost every minute!
Ah_comma_ that's unfortunate. That can be really tough to remember sometimes. I know because I've forgotten that too. But you'll make it up as soon as you can_comma_ I'm sure!
As long as it's not too delinquent_comma_ and you have an otherwise good history of on-time payments_comma_ you should be okay! Try talking to your loan servicer_comma_ too. They can help.
Did they leave a note or anything?  I would be really upset too.  Were there any cameras that could have seen who did it?
Thats the worst.  I would feel so awful if I left a dent and fleed the scene of the crime.  Hopefully the guilt is eating away at that person.
I'm sorry to hear that. 
I will try my best.
Well that's...kinda funny not gonna lie
haha well hey it happens to the best of us...I do it around my friends all the time
That is awesome. you must be very excited.
I bet. It will be great to have some time to unwind and not think about it.
What makes you unsure?
you should do a test drive and apply some math to the pay difference to decide if its worth it.
How fun! What kind of pet is it?
My kids want one of those_comma_ but we have to wait until the youngest is old enough. So cute!
Aww! I bet that is so exciting! Do you want a girl or boy?
I hope it goes well. Children are great.
I am glad you grew out of your shell.
I was really neither.
Dang nice! Bugattis are freakin slick_comma_ definitely a dream car...what does your friend do
Well that makes sense.  And I'm sure you can do the same in good time_comma_ just stay hungry and be about your paper!
I'm sorry to hear that! It sounds like an honest mistake. 
Oh wow_comma_ defenitly sounds like he was too focused on video games. Maybe talk to him about how it made you feel so you don't get resentful. 
Uh oh_comma_ were you alone? Hopefully you didn't have to go very far! That can be super scary for sure.
Well that's just the worst. At least you're okay now! I don't know how you managed it.
Nice did you prepare well for it
Awesome good luck
Really? Why is that?
Oh man that's rough... maybe you should think about moving?
I would have been so embarrassed! Hopefully you didn't get hurt at all
Could have been worse! 
what did you do
did someone help you?
I hate working on the weekend.  Do you have to work this weekend
oh nice.  Thatll be fun.
oh my god that is so scary. what did you do?
that is awesome at least you didn't get hurt. that's what is important
That is annoying. Did you told your manager about it?
Why she doesn't want to do anything about it?
oh my god. i am so sorry. i have two sisters and know that pain.
that is horrible. i hope that your family can really cope thru this difficult time.
That is good_comma_ I am sure your boss loves that.
You should talk to her about that.
Hahaha_comma_ I dont mean to laugh but I'm assuming he is young and kids are pretty funny.  Did anyone else see it happen?
I'm sure the other people thought kids will be kids.  He'll learn eventually!
Now that's just not right! Weekends are supposed to be for relaxing and hanging out with friends_comma_ not slaving away for the man! Hopefully you didn't have to cancel any plans...
Wow_comma_ that really sucks_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that. You deserve to take yourself some vacation time or sick time or something.
You can do it_comma_ you just need to start right away
Just putting away a little still helps
i always feel like i'm on top of the world after i workout. 
i must agree. even when i get spaghetti legs i must say it's worth the rush that comes with it.
what project is that
oh that sounds interesting
Wow. Is he doing this for a show or a competition?
Terrible. So he is making himself unhealthy for a t shirt.
What kind would you get
Oh cute.  I have one.  SHe is the nicest dog
Did you discipline her?
Yeah that is always gross
why what happened
hopefully it works out for you
Why is that?
Lol! Ah- Well cherish them while you can in the summers even though it can be tiring :)
Well that's pretty annoying. Aren't they supposed to have people there who do that for you?
If that happens again_comma_ you should tell them they should have to pay you the appropriate wage to do work that they're supposed to be doing themselves. That's insane!
Sorry to hear that. What happens during your nightmare?
Well I hope you can find some peace from those dreams.
Great to have a daughter in basketball!
Fantastic!
Did you enjoy it?
Well_comma_ maybe you won't do it again.
That is good_comma_ do you like to drink?
Do you plan to quit forever?
Why?
Me too_comma_ sometime_comma_ I had the same feeling about someone walking behind me.
oh thats a nice suprise
yea thats good they did
Oh_comma_ who are they playing?
That will be so fun!
I love IKEA_comma_ they have good meatballs.
Hopefully you can understand the instructions.
But it's good that you made friends though_comma_ right? Will you still be able to keep in touch with them?
Well then that's all the more reason to take more trips so you can see them! Maybe go on a couchsurfing tour of the world!
did you go ?
thats good_comma_ keep going!
That was rude. Did they stop
Thats still tough to go through though
Good luck are you hoping for a boy or girl?
That is so exciting. 
it will be exciting. what will you be doing?
i'm sure you will do just fine. i hope that you will do well.
why didnt you go ?
ah that stinks
That is a lot of meat.
Did they throw up after they finished?
rain storm or thunder storm?
we've had some pretty bad storms here too this year. it worries me too
Oh wow that sounds good to me
I like memories like that
good luck
what do you plan to do there
Why were you scared
That does sound a little scary
It can be tough when friends have things that might be considered better than what you have.  Maybe it can be used as motivation
I am sure you are at least happy for your friend_comma_ right?
I have done that. It happens to the best of us
I am sure no one really noticed
oh that was awkward
probably the best option
What kind of pet is it?
No way! They scare me :( Is it easy?
Ready for what?
Great. What is the test about?
Thats not fair! what has he done that you havent done?
Thats so annoying.  Ive been in a similar situation. Just keep working hard. Youll get there one day
i cant say that i do
i highly doubt that
That's nice! How are you gonna spend your weekend?
Oh man_comma_ good luck! Hope you roll high.
Oh wow.  I hope she's still doing well!
Well good luck to her.  I know that's a tough thing to recover from.
That must be nice
Yeah_comma_ I think we all wish that was possible
Oh wow. How long has your cousin been overseas?
That's real nice of him. Do you miss him?
Have you used it yet
That is very smart
Oh damn. So why'd she pick you?
Spread of that magic_comma_ my dude.
Nice nothing better than homemade mom lunches...what did she bring you
Stir fries are the bomb.
Thats awesome. i wish i still had mine.  I sold it a couple years ago
I wonder if there are any repair shops that could fix it
What happened? Are you ok?
I mean they could have just run your items instead of making you mad.
I bet you were anxious to know how you did! Did you study up with friends or family leading up to the driver's test?
Oh well that's a bit different of a situation_comma_ lol. I gotcha! I didn't know you had to retake the test if you accidentally let it expire. But I'm sure you did great!
That's awesome! I'm proud of you_comma_ buddy.
Oh sweet. What number tattoo is it?
That's pretty awesome. What is it gonna be of?
What did you cook
That sounds very good right now
That's great to hear. Are you usually really busy?
That's crazy. Well_comma_ I hope you have an awesome weekend!
what kind of cake are you going to get ?
that does sound good
That is a horrible pain
I am sorry that happened to you
I know needles suck but_comma_ its always a good decision to go to the doctor.
I'm glad you made the right decision. Even if you were a little anxious.
Glad to hear it went well. So you do have the second date planned?
You think she's a keeper?
He did not like the way she looked?
I guess thats a reason alright
Wow that is actually a very good thing to do. And it also saves momey!
I should start doing that too. Good idea!
Oooh_comma_ that sounds fun. What are you planning on shopping for?
Oh_comma_ what a coincidence! I moved into a new apartment as well. You need more stuff than you'd think!
That's not good. Guess they didn't leave their information_comma_ hu?
Well_comma_ that's classy. 
oh thats nice_comma_ good luck
you'll be fine!
You'll miss it now.  But you'll be grateful once you get your money right.  There's no better freedom than real adulthood_comma_ Young Padawan
You'll figure it out.  Been financially independent for 2 years and now fully self-employed with my own car_comma_ studio apartment_comma_ and nobody tells me what I can't and can't do.  It's pretty dope
Leg day? Never heard of that. Do explain.
Oh yeah now I get it. Hope you get a good workout in.
I've been eating Mexican food almost every day
Nope still love it haha
Oh nice. What are you gonna do with that money?
Dude_comma_ you're gonna feel a lot of relief paying it off.
I thought your brothers dog wasn't to be trusted. No crash_comma_ I was lucky to get out of the way.
I was pretty shacky afterwards though.
Wow_comma_ that is really exciting. You must be anxious waiting for a response.
4
Wonder why they laughed. It's not like everyone hasn't done something embrassing like that.
Must feel really bad. I'm sorry that happened.
Did something come up where you couldn't make it?
Hopefully you were able to get it fixed_comma_ those things happen.
What happened?
Sorry to hear about that. Do you know why they gave it to him?
Last week_comma_ my wife told me that she had a lover. I felt totally destroyed.
I left the home. I am currently at the hotel. She want me to come back
That really stinks. Why couldn't you leave work?
Man that really stinks. I hope that you didn't stay too late
yea? i think its the same there is just more coverage of everything
i hope we do but it will probably be after im dead and gone
Yea. I get ya there. It's like having a fat doctor give you diet advice.
hahaha I mean whoever isn't doing well in whatever area they're giving advice in_comma_ shouldn't be giving advice.
Don't it always seem to goooo That you don't know what you've got til its gone...
Counting Crows? Lol nevermind....but that's a bummer_comma_ hope you saved pictures at least
Yeah it's been crazy hot lately.
Sure enough.  Enjoy it while you can.
It's always fun to remember the fun (and sometimes wild) times from college with a friend.
Haha hopefully that guy isn't scarred for life or something.
Me too. What do you have planned?
Cool_comma_ I live near the coast. Great time to go there.
im sure you will be fine
good luck
did he get a beat down?
that sucks
I'm sorry you missed it.
You need a new job that is more family oriented.
That is a terrible thing but your situation has an toll on you have you considered getting help?
You need to commit I know it is hard I could only imagine but I know you have a good support system to make things right with family and parents you have to get clean. 
90s music was great.  Do you have a favorite band or song?
Mmmbop.  Thats cool_comma_ I didnt know they were still touring
Were they lottery and scratch off tickets?
Oh yeah! I remember people went nuts over the Princess Diana bear but she isn't worth anything at all after all.
oh thats awesome
keep it up!
Woah!  Bet he was digesting for days!
That is amazing.  He should be on one of those food shows to see how much he can eat.
Oh no that is truly tragic. People dont appreciate the older novelties
You dont know what you got till its gone.. lol the ignorance!!!
I could be wrong...but I feel like they just miss your company...and are using your grandma as a scapegoat.  Don't be so hard on them they're not always gonna be around ;)
You must have a good_comma_ positive energy and that's what they miss.  I used to be the same.  But when they're dead and gone you'll miss the pestering so love them for who they are_comma_ you're still free to make your own choices. Peace
Do you make them for a living or as a hobby?
I've never even attempted something so huge. You must be very creative and precise. 
I'm so sorry for your loss.
I hope you will be able to heal from this. 
wow how do you do it?
dang that sucks.. hopefully it pay well
Oh no. No one available to walk you part way or anything?
Did anything happen?
Sounds like a lot of fun! I'm sure it'll be a great date to bond.
Yes defenitly! Go on the ferris wheel and buy her some cotton candy :)
Aw_comma_ that's sweet. What kind of pet is it? Did you wish you could steal it so it could be yours instead?
Hmm_comma_ I don't think I've ever known anyone who has a bearded dragon before actually. That's really cool though! Did you let the two of y'alls bearded dragons ever interact?
Why?
Ah ah_comma_ have fun.
That is so cool_comma_ what was the project?
That is so awesome_comma_ so it was a real life advanced battle bots.  So amazing.  Congratulations!
You must be so excited!
I hope you have a great time!
How did you do that?
Wow_comma_ that's awful but you know_comma_ we all make dumb mistakes like that in desperate times.
That is so wonderful that you give your parents the credit and are so grateful for what they did for you!
I hope my kids say the same thing about me helping them that much when they grow up.
You must cook a lot of tasty food all the time!
hmm did you try calling pest control
yea thats true
i wish i could do that too
Why were you scared
Yeah_comma_ that does sound a little scary
Good for you. How did you know what that meant?
Very nice. I need to learn some new words.
That sounds awesome_comma_ were are you going if you don't mind?
Nice! The summer is the perfect time for the beach.
I remember my wife saying that when she was pregnant with both of ours.  How far along are you?
That is a very long time.  Is this your first?
Ugh I've been there before... What do they do?
Eeeewwww... some people have no shame
How did it go?
That's great news to hear!
same thing happened to me.. i believe it 
they dont care about you unless you got tons of money in their back
is she coming back ?
oh yea .. well you can facetime or video chat in the meantime!
That would be awesome. What would you do with the winnings?
hahaha have you ever been to Hawaii?
They're checking you out or they're glaring at you?
Ha ha!  Guess they like what they see! 
4 is still a baby for me...but i'd start treating him like a man
That's funny.
I love hondas.  Are you jealous of that person?
I know that feeling_comma_ friend.
Is it for a special event?
I hope you are able to get it done in time - I love cheesecake so I'm jealous I won't be there to eat it!
Oh god. Was it big?
Wow. Does it happen often then?
That's awesome_comma_ she sounds multi faceted.
That's human_comma_ when you live for a while you don't have to get stuff right the first time.
Oh yeah baby_comma_ that sounds awesome. I don't know what it is_comma_ but those "buy in bulk" stores' food cafes always have INSANE pizza. I'm jealous!
Believe me_comma_ I've eaten my fair share of it. My stepmom used to take me and my brother there when we were younger. I'll always have fond memories of it. But you're right_comma_ I do need to go back and get some more sometime!
Wow that sounds exciting and anxiety-inducing at the same time_comma_ hope it turns out well for you.
Well it's good you have some friendly support in case it goes poorly.
Oh wow. How many have they had now? lol
Oh not that much really.
Wow_comma_ that's a huge step. Are you excited?
I'm sure it'll be amazing
Oh wow. I'm impressed he can make furniture! Is he busy?
Awww give him some time. I'm sure he'll get to it eventually.
Oh no!  Did you overdraw your account?
Ugh_comma_ its the worst. I've had that happen a few times to me.  Like a punch to the gut.
Well_comma_ you definitely deserve it then!
How much of a raise are you getting?
You sound like a very good friend!
I wish I had a friend like you.
I love ice cream cake_comma_ did you enjoy it?
Its just cake_comma_ there will always be another cake
I know what you mean_comma_ no one can get to you like your mom. But they are awesome.
Oh yes_comma_ to be raised by or spend as much time with their family. It sure is a crazy world.
Oh damn. Did you do something to upset your dog?
Oh no. Did something bad happen?
they got a ton of worker bees following their command
yea
I'm sorry to hear that. Will you get a day off soon?
I'll pray for ya! You need a break before you burn out.
I guess its an insect?
I guess you have to asks its creator
Oh I get you. It's been raining here everyday.
I hope you get some sun where you are_comma_ too. Too much rain can get depressing.
Now that is one of the most unfortunate things I've heard all week. How did you get it out of your hair? Eeww
That_comma_ I think_comma_ is a pretty justifiable response honestly_comma_ lol. Now at the very least all you'll have to do is clean the umbrella!
Wow. That's pretty amazing. You have been through quite a lot in life.
Hopefully_comma_ it'll be smooth sailing from no onwards.
Oohh...if you're the girl that's ok...if you're a guy c'mon buddy_comma_ bring some cash lol
Tsk tsk gotta have a backup.  Nothing turns a girl off more than having to pay for everything...they like the feeling of security
How much is the jackpot?
That is a whole lot of money!
you were too good for them anyway!
im sure you will do great where ever you end up going
You must be a great student!
I wish you more success in your education.
Yikes. Why did you take it may I ask?
Ah_comma_ well if you haven't sold it yet_comma_ there's still time to return it!
where were you all going to go ?
oh that sounds like fun
Why were you scared?
I feel like I have heard that a lot tonight
Why are you surprised she asked you out? 
A lot of girls don't follow the traditional ways anymore.
It is kind of odd to look at ourselves from that long ago_comma_ and we didn't even realize what we looked like usually at that time.
It's like you're looking at someone else almost.
Why did they cancel
I guess work does that sometimes
Impressive! It is all going to be well worth it in the long run_comma_ keep going ghost rider!
If theres a will then theres a way! Er in most situations_comma_ were not talking about you trying to do brain surgery tomorrow or anything. 
Haha. That would have scared me so much.
You never know with those cats. They are very sly.
Oh I hope it does! I bet you've got a super secret ingredient that makes it stand out from the rest of the rabble.
Then it will be appropriate if it pays off for you. If you win first prize_comma_ I'm gonna need you to start getting it put in grocery stores so I can buy some!
what does she say ?
sounds scary
oh no. this sounds bad.
I'm so sorry to hear that. Have you tried calling your local shelther or animal control?
Oh_comma_ sometimes you just have to accept weather changing your plans. I am sure you can go another time.
That's a bummer. Well I hope you can find another weekend to make up for it.
wow. a cruise sounds pretty amazing. where to?
Oh man. You'll get to spend time with the family_comma_ too. that's what's up.
That sounds so good!
I know right!  Asian food is pricey.
Wow! That's pretty amazing. How are you gonna spend it?
hahaha still in shock_comma_ hu? Well_comma_ as long as it's the good of shock. :)
Oh no what happened?
Do you think that if you apologized they would forgive you?
Why did you do that
I understand_comma_ people do it all of the time
why ? im sure you will be fine
yea i can understand that
What happened?
Were you able to find your dog?
Oh damn. Me too. What area are you in?
Northeast here. Must be raining all along the coast.
Are you happy with that
I guess it was just meant to be then
Omg that is awful. How long did it take to recover? 
I bet! I am glad it wasn't even for serious than it was already.
I know_comma_ I can't wait either!
I am rooting for the Longhorns!
I guess people are way more rude these days arent they
I do miss that as well_comma_ maybe it will come back
Oh_comma_ that's got to feel rough. It's not quite the same_comma_ but I've felt similarly when I couldn't get previous ex-girlfriends gifts during holidays or their birthdays or something. But I'm sure she knows you love her anyway.
It does. Feeling bad about it is enough to show you care about her_comma_ which is something_comma_ paradoxically_comma_ to feel good about I think. Just keep being a good dad to her. :)
That is great. How old is she?
At this age_comma_ they are cute.
You couldn't say no to working?
That is a real bummer.  I'm sorry that happened to you.  Will you be able to reschedule your plans?
I am sorry it didn't work out. But happy to hear you are happy now.
That is so wonderful_comma_ because that doesn't normally happen.
That must be annoying!
I hope that gets resolved soon.
Yikes. Mine was 210.
Turn the AC up a little :)
It looks good. Should I save my money?
I thought the name was dumb too_comma_ but the previews looked awesome. Is it scary at all because I don't llike anthing remotel scary
That sounds soooo good! I'm eating low-carb right now but I'm a pushover for good mashed potatoes!
LOL!  I've done things like that before also_comma_ sometimes you just need some me time with some good food ya know?
Oh no_comma_ I hate when that happens
Good luck_comma_ lots of coffee!
I think it is_comma_ that might make you feel better
Its the perfect time to go see them then
That is tough. Was it a big lie?
You must be feeling pretty guilty. That sucks. 
What kind of test was it
I am sure you will do better next time
Oh gross! That must have been disgusting to see.
Wow_comma_ I can only imagine what other gross things she does.
Is that a video game?  Is it Mario?
I used to LOVE Mario Kart - I'm not a big video game fan but I loved that one.  I can see why you are excited about it coming out!
What exactly did you see?
Wow that's very annoying_comma_ he should be arrested.
Wow_comma_ how amazing is that!? I wish someone would do that for me! I mean_comma_ I don't think I buy more than $30 of groceries at a time since it's just me_comma_ but still!
That's a wonderful idea_comma_ I love that! And you know_comma_ if you find you can't quite do the exact same thing for someone else_comma_ you can always donate food to a food bank or something. It's the exact same thing_comma_ and it'll make you feel awesome.
Oh that sucks! Maybe you can go the next day.
Do you normally go very often?
oh wow! that is horrible!! did they get away with it?
i am sorry to hear that. that is a bad incident to have happen on vacation
That is so exciting.  Is this your first?
I guess you have a plan to induce labor_comma_ or a scheduled C-section?
Oh_comma_ Do you think you did something wrong? 
That's terrible I wouldn't like for that to happen to me.
Where did you go and what happened?
That's too bad_comma_ did you get to the second place after?
What are they coming to fix?
Oh my my_comma_ hope it gets fixed fast
Woohooo... I bet you're ecstatic
I can't wait until my daughter is old enough to go to school lol 
That's great.
I know how that feels. Its a good feeling to be on the right path finally
That sounds like a neat tradition. What did you guys do with the apples once they were all picked?
Sounds like a bunch of tasty items! My mom used to make a banging apple pie whenever I came home for Thanksgiving. It was the best feeling in the world eating it.
That is amazing!  I'm so happy for you!  What kind of car did they get you?
Hey_comma_ a new car is a new car!  I'm dying from heat in my car since the A/C broke.  Have fun driving!
That's awesome! How long do you think it will take you to build it?
Is this the first time you've put a computer together?
Ah_comma_ I know that feeling well. My family moved around a ton while I was in grade school_comma_ so I don't really have many long term friends. Don't worry though_comma_ you'll make friends at your new job so easily_comma_ you won't even remember you didn't have friends!
I mean yeah_comma_ it can't hurt_comma_ can it? I'm sure they'll be excited to meet you and get to know you as much as vice versa. Plus_comma_ who knows? Your new best friend might be in there for all you know!
That bad huh? what was wrong with'em
They? you went on a date with more than one person??
That can be a scary thing to see
I like cats_comma_ but not those kind of cats
That does sound lonely. Do you have friends to turn to?
Well thats good. If you can find a hobby to occupy those evenings that would be best.
Oh no!  Are you hurt?  Don't even worry about them. It happens to the best of us.
I'm glad you're okay.  It is so embarrassing.  I've done that before but at least you got back up!  Pride can heal and a body takes longer to! 
I bet! I am still too scared to ride one.
Maybe I should get over my fear and finally ride one.
That's really sweet of him. How long have you been friends?
What do you guys like to do for fun?
Aw_comma_ that's too bad. What kind of restaurant was it?
Dang_comma_ what I would do for some sweet chinese now. Did you find one to replace it?
I'm sorry to hear that. Adolph must've had a happy life though.
Man. What was it like having a armadillo as a pet?
That's really sad. Were you close to him?
I am sorry to hear that. I was pretty distraught when I lost my granddad as well. May he rest in peace.
It sounds like a big opportunity for you.  Are you ready for it?
Good luck_comma_ I'm sure you will do well.
What in the world. Are they doing drugs?
Omg_comma_ I would be videoing it for sure lol
What's your favorite Mexican sweet?
I have never had any either. I hope you enjoy them!
That's pretty nice! I haven't been skating in a coon's age. Is the rink nice?
That's great! I may look it up and go to their grand opening as well.
Oh you've definitely done your part to prepare. Good luck!
What is the position for?
I love reminiscing like that_comma_ I hope they were all good memories!
I'm glad!  It's funny how we can look back and be able to remember the good times!
That seems really nice actually. I do have a few close female friends.
You must really trust these people. Yall must have been friends for a long time.
On no! Did you report it?
Was it a really expensive one?
That's awesome_comma_ It's nice to have friends that are role models
Hard work is always rewarded!
That's great. Where are y'all from?
I visited once there. The people are very nice.
Why does that bother you?
Sometimes thats the best option.
ah thats so bad!! did you fix it yet?
you would be irritated for couple of days then 
Well dang man. It's never too late! Just hit her up on the ole Facebook!
I am sure you two will be having babies in no time if you hit her up right this instant!
awww sorry bout your rug...there's a facebook group called doggo you should follow...owners post pics of their dogs with signs around their necks like "I like jumping out of moving cars just to poop in front of strangers" you might be less mad looking at them haha
Yup.  But here's a link https://www.facebook.com/doggocom/photos/pcb.511713622609187/511711852609364/?type=3&theater
what does that mean?
OH like a raise? If you worked hard they should give it to you
oh how did you miss that?
ah thats so bad!!. You are right in this age we need to get rid of this written checks
Oh what happened? Did your car break down?
Ohh I feel bad for you. I am sure everything going to be alright.
I haven't but I am familiar with it.
What team does he play for?
That's really great to hear. It's always good to prepare for big events like that. What's the meeting about?
I am sure you're going to crush it into the ground.
That is great to hear. Are you good at math?
I hope you do well then
Right_comma_ sometimes I feel the same way when I feel like I should have something_comma_ but then I realize I would get bored from it after a while like everything
Yeah_comma_ and it's just one more thing you have to keep track of
Ohh. Good for him. Some guys are born lucky
Ohh don't feel bad. I am sure someday you will get one.
You are so brave to do that!
Your dog is very lucky!
ive had one dogg that I love_comma_ but since she did its been hard to love again.
yeah she was an older family dog.
Engaging in conversation_comma_ whether the spoken or written word helps to further communication along.
You are doing a great job ! You are following our conversation naturally.
Did he at least take you out to lunch with the winnings?
Maybe you will win next time.
I cant imagine seeing one in real life. I would be so scared.
I dont think I could go anywhere where they may be. Its terrifying to think about.
I agree. That is rude and annoying. How do you handle it?
I generally tend to start walking away from them.
Holy cow! I think I would have passed out if I was you!
Oh wow_comma_ You probably shouldn't be drinking and driving tho.
I am sure that makes you feel bad_comma_ have you talked to them about how you feel?
That is a sticky situation to be in
Oh I'm glad you got it! Did someone call out for you?
You had that instinct. 
I would be happy too if I had that. What kind of cat do you have?
Aw_comma_ well it's good that you guys took him in. You're a kind sould.
I think some kids go through that. Did your parents comfort you?
Oh no. Did you get much sleep as a kid at all?
Oh god. That must be terrifying.
Oh lord. They're still there?
That sounds very fortunate. Good timing.
Pets are amazing in that way. Glad he was there for you when you needed it.
Boy_comma_ what I would do for a slice o that right now. What kind of pizza is it?
Dang_comma_ I bet that'll be better than that racist Papa John's pizza!
Oh god. Well_comma_ at least it died nice and full.
I'm sure it was! Kinda feel bad for it.
That sounds exciting! The seminar will be a great time to connect with your bosses
Great! I'm so happy that your hard work was worth it!
Oh really_comma_ cat does like that?
ah thats horrible. Did you take her to the doctor's?
Oh man. Did you get a chance to say goodbye?
hm must've been a big goldfish.
That's pretty cool. Maybe you could toss me a few recipes for recently deceased goldfish?
No_comma_ no! I swear I don't! I meant the cracker goldfish! The crackers!!!
On no! Did you get hurt?
I bet! I would be too! I am so sorry that happened to you.
That's exciting! I have no idea how that sport is even played_comma_ but I'm glad you go to go see it! Did the team you were rooting for win?
I will definitely be on the lookout for it. That is awesome though_comma_ you were supporting your team! You may have been all by yourself_comma_ but you were the only one getting to celebrate! Hell yeah_comma_ brother!
Well_comma_ you can call her today and make up for it?
Why did you lie to her?
Wow how did that happen?? 
Well I'm sure you figured out your mistake right away!
You should do it.  I think you'll do great.
Where are you going to go on your first date?
I'm so sorry to hear that. Why did it happen?
Yea. So you didn't get that warning not to date crazy_comma_ hu?
Oh gross_comma_ did you spit it back out?
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Maybe it's not that bad? just drink a lot of water
That's terrible_comma_ my friend. Is there a chance to get it in the near future?
I am sure you will. Just gotta keep kicking butt and taking names!
Ugh_comma_ I hate that!  What are they doing to irritate you?
That's horrible - can you complain the complex or HOA?   Or figure out a way to cut their power is always an option?
Thats going to take forever
Aw. I do that too. I still have my old cell phones with videos of mt babies doing nothing lol
hm is there a reason you are going? have you been experiencing chronic pain?
That sucks. I hope it helps!
Pets are great companions.  Mine follow me around everywhere and I am sure you cat does the same thing
Animals are pretty intuitive.  That are great at picking up people's moods I have found
Oh yeah? Was it any good?
Oh I see. What made you finally decide to try it out?
well that is def a big decision to consider
it is a life changer for sure. it will change the everyday activities in your life
That's exciting! What car did you get?
Great car! I love Subarus_comma_ my favorite is the impreza with turbo
Aw_comma_ that's so sweet. Why would you say such a thing?
Sounds like a great girlfriend. I am sure she will be around for whenever you need her like you did last week.
Oh sounds exciting! How'd it go
I should try it one day! Were you afraid of heights?
Oh what was it about? Was it for an event?
That sounds like a touching moment. How wonderful for you!
Ohh that's bad. How did you feel?
Ohh I am so sorry. That one's my favorite too! But_comma_ I feel bad for you.
I am sure you had a really good reason right?
Oh wow_comma_ I hope you get some help soon.
ah that's so sad. You would miss your favorite one. i think you need to find something else
You will definitely will 
That must've really upset you. Did they explain why?
Definitely take some time to vent out your anger. It's totally undestandable.
Wow! What platform was it for? Nintendo or Atari or Sony?
Sounds like you had a great childhood_comma_ you can try playing it now by downloading an emulator haha_comma_ I tried that and it was great
thats nice of you to rely on a friend.
then you got good set of friends. Don't lose them for your life!!
Alright_comma_ I can get behind that. Sisters-in-law are usually angry messes of human beings anyway_comma_ so I'll back you up on that. What did she do though?
Yeah that's pretty unacceptable. As a former teacher myself_comma_ I can assure you that as much as I loved those kids_comma_ my kids would always come first no matter what.
That's too bad. In all fairness_comma_ no one really needs a good car. I have a beater_comma_ but it's get me from place to place. That's all that really matters.
I am sure you'll reach your goal one day. I do hope you get that brand spanking new car.
did you say something
did your girlfriend like that
I hope you do well on it! Do you feel prepared?
That's great! Make sure to check your answers twice!
I do too! Love going out and swimming in the ocean. Why do you like going?
I love doing that too and the price is totally worth it.
Being alone or going bowling - or both?
I'd get some new friends that's for sure!!  It stinks when they don't stick with you!
Oh man_comma_ what are you getting that for? I hope everything is okay.
I am sure. I do hope that they find the cause.
what was the gift ? i can imagine it was something wonderful.
was it colorful or did it play a tune ? 
Are there any favorite tunes that it plays ?
did you try clear it?
okay do it continue_comma_ it will clear
I can relate.  What's the saddest movie you've ever watched?
Yea_comma_ that's a really emotional one for a lot of people.  I see that one mentioned a lot for tear jerkers.
That's terrible! Are the police doing anything about it?
Oh man. Well_comma_ be careful out there. Wouldn't want anything to happen to you or your family.
Me too_comma_ sometimes I still get scared to stare into mirrors in the dark
Hahaha_comma_ me too definitely
Yikes_comma_ did it take long to clean it up?
Well I hope your dog is feeling better_comma_ it would be bad if he was feeling sick or stressed
I am sure you will present a stellar product. What is the powerpoint on?
Sounds pretty cool. I am sure he will end up investing.
Oh yeah? What is the name?
Oh ok. That is a realy good show. I watch it too.
That's too bad. Do you have any friends or other family that you can do that with?
I am sure. I do hope you find peace with your football watching and your good ole dad.
Thats gross. Did you punish the dog at all
Poor dog_comma_ I hope she learns from it
Really? What was his first word?
That is a really complex word!
That's really great to hear. I love my wife too. What does she do that make you appreciate her every day?
Mine does the same! It's nice coming home to a clean house everyday.
Ah that must have been surprise for you
You should also reach out to  her
I do feel bad for them as well_comma_ its tough to see
People have to look after themselves
Wow_comma_ that's amazing! I'm insanely jealous! I think it's pretty normal to be scared of that though. After all_comma_ it wouldn't be nearly as much fun if it didn't terrify you_comma_ right?
Exactly! Embrace the danger. Become the danger. Do like 800 flips while you're falling through the air_comma_ but do yourself a favor and don't vomit okay?
ah thats really gross!!. I hate it road authority do not clear dead animals from the roads asap
We need to do an online petition and raise a complaint against authority!!
Nice! Is it your first time buying?
Good to hear. I hope the house warming party is banging.
OMG. I think I would have passed out.
Did you take the time to walk her outside?
ah thats so sad. why did she is leaving her though?
i am so sure you will miss her. Keep in touch with her though
Oh no I'm so sorry to hear that
I bet_comma_ stay strong!
Nice! Did you get the job?
Wow...I am really sorry_comma_ friend. Any other interviews lined up?
I hate when that happens and I dont even have a dog
are there places you can take the dog where they teach them not to do that
I'm sorry.  It happens to all of us.
I am sure you can go back.
Yeah? Is it decorated well or just very large?
Wow_comma_ I bet. He must make a lot of money!
I feel the same way. I never thought kids could be that mean!
It is so sad. I worry everyday about my school age kids.
What kind of ladder was it
You can always try again tomorrow
thats amazing_comma_ and also i would be a little envious_comma_ I just want love.
I believe its out there for all of us_comma_ we just gotta find it.
Oh no!  hav you been out looking for her?
Did you put your phone number and things on the sign?
That's too bad. Maybe you should get a new one?
I certainly would. How can you jam out to all the NOW CD's without it?
Why didn't you want to go anywhere?
Well_comma_ in that case it's better that you just relax.
Yeah_comma_ what happened next?
Why were you not sleeping
have you taken the test yet
if you studied really hard then you should
That's terrible. Have you confronted him about it?
I'm not sure what that means_comma_ but you should talk to him about it!
Good luck with that. Are you well prepared?
Cool.
I would do that too. It's a waste of money if you don't finish it!
I am sorry you felt that way.
On no. Did you get a letter from the IRS?
Yeah I would to if I was in your position. 
Oh my! What a smelly situation. Were you able to clean it up and get the smell out?
Is her litter box full? My cat does that when it is too full and I neglect to clean it.
That's such an awful feeling! I at least do it twice a year -_-
I feel you. Last time I did that I was late for work...I hate it when it happends.
Hmmm_comma_ maybe that's because you ate it and you've got a sugar rush. I wouldn't worry! That usually fades in a couple hours. 
Eh_comma_ it's okay. Don't beat yourself up about it. It's truly a victimless crime. There are much_comma_ much worse things you could have done_comma_ I promise.
I really hate when that happens
next time call the police
No way_comma_ that's gross. What happened?
That's disgusting. Some people are pigs.
Oh wow. Do you think you might get sick?
I don't think that 's very healthy. 
thats nice family should not fight forever
you only get one family
You must be happy for her!!
ah that sucks!! but you can't help it. It's your friend's decision
What a jerk! Why is she always in your biz?
I would get up in her face and show her who's boss. Break out the broom and crack it across her old_comma_ measly back!
20 pizzas!!!  How did you fit that in your stomach without it exploding?
I think I'd look into entering some eating contests if I were you!
Oh no... I hope it's for the best
Good luck :)
It's okay to have cheat days sometimes! Start again tomorrow!
What type of diet are you following?
That is interesting. Did you have a good time?
I bet! I would be too scared to even try!
I hope you can get treated.
I am sure you will get better.
Oh no!  Did she say anything about it?
I think that as a bit harsh!  It wasn't like you did it on purpose thinking it would be funny or anything.
Wow_comma_ did that bother your co-workers?
You might want to find a new job
Ah_comma_ I certainly know the feeling of bringing back old memories. It's fun to go back and remember the people you shared all those classes with_comma_ isn't it?
I know exactly what you mean! All the old flames_comma_ the old rivalries_comma_ everything is like it was yesterday. It's a pretty cool feeling.
Awesome. Is he learning to cook for the first time?
Oh wow. Well good for him! I know that makes you happy!
Is that a favorite of yours?  I've never watched it.
I know how you feel. I've had shows that I've loved that have ended and it's like losing a best friend.  I'm sorry it's ending.
why what happened
oh I only have a few more years with mine too
Yeah? Me too_comma_ I used to be afraid of aliens. What were you scared of?
Yes he could be! Maybe you should check under the bed right now. He could be watching you.
What a jerk. Why doesn't he get a job at McDonalds?
I would remove him from your family tree. That will show him.
Credit card? That seems like an invasion of privacy
Yeah_comma_ maybe have a talk with her. Or maybe think positive_comma_ she might be getting you a gift? Haha
Story of my everyday life. I swear I ear a jingle for hours
Ugh_comma_ Its such a weird brain function.
I bet! You may have to wash your car to get that smell out!
lol. Hopefully that will be the last one you run over.
What did you do?
It's good that you went easy on her.
That's terrible! Did you confront them about it?
Sounds like the right move. Good on you for standing up for yourself.
How come? Were you scared you wouldn't wake up?
Aww_comma_ that's sad to hear. I hope you didn't lose too much sleep!
That's too bad. Have you seen a doctor about it?
Ah_comma_ makes sense. Just drink milk everyday and it should be fine in a week.
That's pretty dumb. Did you eventually get the part?
Ah. What a terrible inconvenience!
Oh no! How are you going to clean it out?
Yikes! That must have been terrible
Nice! How did that feel?
Oh_comma_ how did she look? Still pretty?
wow how much
thats a nice chunk of change
That's really annoying. Was the wrong order any good? 
Hm.. judging from your conditions_comma_ maybe McDonald's isn't the best place for your to eat anyway! 
I think thats a positive thing. Motivation is the key. Do you think he'll follow through and actually attend the gym ?
you will be a great motivational coach. Such positivity !
On no. Dont be too hard on yourself. You must have needed the rest.
I understand. But you are human! 
That's awful! Were you able to clean it off?
Oh no_comma_ I hope you can get the shoe removed from your foot.
Aw_comma_ that's exciting! I think I would swell with pride if a swear word were my kid's first word too!
WOWAOEAOEAEOHHHH_comma_ now that was unexpected! Are you at all concerned that you're raising a Communist_comma_ or have you decided to embrace the hammer and sickle and seize the means of production?
Were you any good in high school or was it just fun?
Oh okay well that sounds nice. I haven't played much tennis but I miss having more free time to do similar hobbies.
Awesome! What breed is your dog?
How sweet. I might get one myself then.
Hey now_comma_ you're an all star! Did you know they wrote that song with the hopes of giving their fans more confidence? 
Yeah_comma_ they're a great group. Very fun and uplifting.
How fun! I remember the good old days with those games you didn't need a monthly subscription to
Yeah they're all pay to play_comma_ I think you should be able to play the whole game the first time you buy it...
Why don't you change your provider?
Why you don't have a choice?
That must be annoying.
You should call the police on him.
Well_comma_ they deserve it. Medical school is not easy and they spent unimaginable effort and hard work to finish it
I truly respect and admire those people. They are the most beneficial members of the society
Well maybe he trusted you as a good friend_comma_ next time try to help him with his homework instead
Oh yeah_comma_ that's not great. Next time make sure to say no directly to his face
I am sure you will! Did you make sure you took time working on it?
Then I know you will do great! Good luck!
I love boots fall is best for fashion
now you have me excited too
Is she still single? Some people don't like to be in a relationship
Hahaha_comma_ well she found the "one" I guess
Yikes_comma_ that sounds horrifying
I would be grossed out too
You are lucky to have that in your community.
It is good that you care about that too.
Thats the worst part_comma_ I just finished one aswell_comma_ ended up doing pretty well.
yep_comma_ its the not knowing that gets to you most.
Uh oh. I am sorry. What happened?
I am sorry. At least you tried.
Do you have a pet
Did you gave any pet name to your cat
Oh yeah me too. They can be so rude. 
You are right. Some people should never drive a car again!
I understand that feeling sometimes.
You can tell me anything.
whys that?? were they growing out of them/
wow_comma_ thats slightly harsh_comma_ but they have to learn some way.
I like that too
I wants had a smoothie that was terrible there
What a wonderful time for your family! Is it a boy or girl?
Oh fun! A little girl will be a great addition to the family
But america is so great now! look at all the great things that are happening and are great
No_comma_ he truly is lower than a dog himself
Really??? A power out does not sound that scary
Now_comma_ that is scary!! Without power for days would be a nightmare 
Why and what's HOA?
The thing I don't like is that the HOA monitors that type of stuff.
Did you get really wet? I hope you didn't catch a cold
Oh well I'm sure they didn't judge you_comma_ it could happen to anyone
I think we all did lol
that had to be a long time ago
yeah may be kids changed nowadays!!
then you should instigate something in school!!
Do you like old western movies
That's ok_comma_ I did not know much about it
Ah_comma_ new version of Tom and Jerry. You would  be thinking whether to get or not!!
You should then wait for it. Not sure how much time it will take though!!
I hope so too_comma_ what kind of operation is it?
I don't believe in god_comma_ but I hope you have a good doctor
Oh that's so sad_comma_ how often do you get to visit them?
Maybe video chat them a bit more_comma_ talk to them daily to let them feel your presence
That's great. I should visit you once for your great Pasta!!
you are so skillful!! you should start your own brand!!
Who is the singer?
I am a huge fan of hers too!
Fun_comma_ did you play with your siblings?
Ahh_comma_ I don't have any siblings but I bet it was a great time
Oh man_comma_ that's so disappointing when they do that. Starts off the whole day wrong.
Yeah small hint of peace in the morning before your hectic work day starts and all those meetings.
I know what you mean. I feel the same sometimes but honestly it's not realistoc
That is true. They probably look way different in person
How come? Do you not trust him?
Oh don't think like that_comma_ it will only make things worse. Just be supportive and focus on yourself
Oh I bet! Did you just go on vacation? 
Wow so happy for you. I have always wanted to go myself.
Oh no_comma_ that is terrible.
I'm sorry that happened to you.
Fun_comma_ what concert is it?
Whoop! it's gonna be a fun time!
Wow! Did you confront her about it?
What a horrible thing to witness
Yay! where are you going? are you excited?
wow_comma_ you are so lucky_comma_ I love the beach
Aw_comma_ that's a shame. Is he a house dog or an outside one?
I would be as well. I would just keep a close eye on him whenever you can. Be his eyes.
Oh well you can celebrate it a couple days late_comma_ it's fine
Don't worry_comma_ just appreciate him everyday
awwww..its tough leaving lifelong family pets
i dont blame you. i moved out at 17 and i couldnt ever move back..
I hope you pass! You tried your best
You should celebrate when you hear back!
I have done that way too many times_comma_  maybe use the air drter in the bathroom?
thats hilarious and terrible at the same time.
Do you just walk alone usually?
Maybe you can invite someone every now and then_comma_ like a neighbor or someone you trust.
She sounds like a good person.
You also sound like a good person.
did you do good? or get smacked around alot?
Thats right! they didnt wanna to see the slaughter anymore.
How sweet. What breed is the dog?
Oh ok. That is so nice of y'all. That does not happen often enough.
Really? Why do you do that?
Yeah I understand that. I hope you feel better!
Me too_comma_ I am very lucky to have moved. I used to live in a place with a lot of earthquakes and hurricanes
Yes_comma_ it's a traumatic experience to be in an earthquake
That is a good way to think.
I like your positive attitude!
Where did you go? did you enjoy yourself?
why?? its good time to think
Oh I am sorry to hear that. You will get another chance I am sure
Don't feel too hard on yourself. I am sure you did your best.
oh why not!! quality is better than quantity!!
ah that is also there. You will make new friends!!
Oh no my dear_comma_ what happened to your leg?
Oh wow. Was it a bad car wreck?
Good for you. Socializing through such ways is a great way to enjoy your time. And besides_comma_ I am not Star Wars fan and have not watched any of the movie series
Costume parties are very fun to attend. If i ever attend one_comma_ then i will go in iron man suit. I just love that character and its personality
It sounds like you are a loyal customer! How did you feel about them taking your headphone jack from their cellphones?
I suppose that's true_comma_ although I heard a lot of people were not happy with it.
That sounds scary!
Good thing you didn't get lost!
oh my god_comma_ just your luck huh_comma_  thats crazy.
Me either_comma_ I have broken every phone ive owned!
WHAT HAPPENED?? DID YOU EVER GET IT BACK?!?
did they have an explenation on what happened?
Are you excited?
How exciting! Hopefully it doesn't hurt too bad.
Wow I bet you were surprised!
LOL a bat_comma_ how random
That's amazing! I love finding new places like that.
I hope it does and you can KEEP going there! haha
Did you cover it up or tell them about it?
Now that is what I am talking about!
Whoa! How are you feeling from it now?
It's okay to give in to cravings every now and then.
Wow you were able to do that?
you should reduce the intake!!
Whys that?! is it rotting out?
thats gross_comma_ go see the dentist please!
Unfortunately_comma_ it happens to all of us.
You will if you believe you can!
What did you order?! was it delicious?
thats awesome_comma_ I love applbees_comma_ I like to drink there alot
True friends can be tested at such situations. Good for you to have such friends. It is very rare to have such ones
I have only 2-3 close friends with whom I closely associate. I think that is the ideal number one should have
I agreee_comma_ and I see no point in it_comma_ This is all our country we are all one here_comma_ why fight.
very bleak_comma_ maybe we will have some sort of saving grace candidate.
I could imagine_comma_ we have a whole mountain of it around my apartment building just randomly lying around.
Exactly! I'd like to pick it up with a scooper and throw it in their faces.
oh my god! did you confront him about it?
Perfect_comma_ make him think you dont know_comma_ or dont know everything.
OMG I'd be so upset. Did you confront him about it?
I wish you all the luck!
Oh no! Did they even leave a note of any kind?
I'd be livid! Some people just won't let us have nice things_comma_ I swear.
that sounds great_comma_ I hope you get it!
I'm always nervous at job interviews!
oh no_comma_ were you able to calm him down?
i'm glad he was able to get some relief from that storm anxiety 
i am sorry to hear that. was it a clean break?
i can understand that. it is hard at first but then it gets better. 
I'm very sorry for your loss.
I hope you will be at peace soon.
Oh no! What was he accused of?
Well maybe this will teach him a lesson and he'll come out of prison a new man.
uh oh_comma_ is everything okay? are you nervous? 
thats true_comma_ its always good to get testing and precautionary procedures. 
darn_comma_ Have you been working towards one lately?
have you been passed over it before?
Really! I bet he was a real manly man then!
It's always nice to have someone show you things. You're very lucky.
That sounds great_comma_ were you nervous about the interview?
I hope you get the job!
That's good. Dogs are the best but an obedient dog is even better!
I can't wait to have a dog. Maybe when my daughter is older..
oh that much_comma_ Will you be able to do it?
that's the confidence. I am sure you will do it
I know exactly what you mean.
I'm glad that you care about others.
LOL!! im sorry about that_comma_  did you get him back?
hahaha_comma_ thats true_comma_ thats not the worst outcome
oh man!! i hope you are ok. please tell me someone recorded it
that sounds like a crazy day
Eek! Hopefully your keyboard isn't acting up!
That's a good idea! Or use a vacuum if you can.
better be careful! the weather has been bad here lately too.
nothing worse than being unprepared for a disaster 
Oh_comma_ what job is it?
Wow_comma_ that is very high position!
oh my god_comma_ thats alot of ham_comma_ Did he throw it up after?
Thats a real eater right there_comma_ big belly.
Aww_comma_ I can remember the first time my son said daddy. I thought my heart was going to explode.
It really is. kids can sure bring a wave of emotions upon us.
That's amazing! You must be so happy
Hard work pays off
I do that all the time lol hey_comma_ if it's in there it's up for grabs!
He should have eaten it sooner!
yes there have been.i live in south texas and they are bad here
yeah those do help.set up a perimiter
I'm sure you'll make new friends really soon. 
That's a great idea! Maybe go to the park too and meet people there.
Oh how horrible. I'm sorry sorry to hear that.
Aww I hope so too. Dogs are precious and they aren't here long. We have to be happy for our time with them no matter what.
I'm sure you did amazing_comma_ did you study hard for it?
When will you find out your scores?
That would be great! It would certainly save you from having to buy a new car for a while.
What kind of car can you win?
sounds super fun
yea  have a cat_comma_ i like him
That sucks_comma_ I hate when that happens!
Did you return the favor at all so to speak?
That's good! Have  you met in person?
Totally understandable... I'd be a bit apprehensive too
Really! That's awesome! Was there something new in it you don't usually use?
I think lasagna is one of my favorite things to make
It can be a fun thing as long as one doesn't go overboard.
Yeah_comma_ I have had some legendary hangovers. I try to moderate better these days haha.
That sounds really relaxing and nice.
Well hopefully it doesn't rain or anything.
its understandable_comma_ they are so annoying
yea i hate it
oh no im sorry to hear that
it'll get better in time
thats insane stuff
man thats really disheartening_comma_ you should type faster  tho
That's great! Wheer are you gonna go?
That's a fun place to go. You'll have to be sure to take lots of pics!
You can't believe they did it without asking or that the car needed the repairs?
Wow I hope everything works out for you!
Wow_comma_ that's crazy. Is it very cold where you are living?
Interesting you say that. Here it's warm as well and we had a big rain storm and got some large hail as well!
thats quite nice of them
yea i bet that feels good
Oh no! Hope your cat is feeling okay.
That's the thing about pets_comma_ hard to stay mad at them!
That's so impressive!
Hopefully_comma_ she seems really smart.
that must be so hard to deal with 
He seems to be on the right path now then
Wow did anyone let you at least know?
Wow that is super unlucky_comma_ did she notice at all?
thats really annoying to deal with
still tho thats dangerous
im sorry to hear that. loss of a pet is tough
are you planning on getting another pet?
How long do you have to wait?
Good luck! I'm sure you did great.
Oh wow_comma_ how long has it been since you got last promoted?
Well I hope you get it!
Are you prepared for it? Did you study?
I know what you mean. I think you'll do great though.
sounds quite hard to deal with but good luck
yea i would be too
I definitely understand that feeling.  It took me forever to sign up for my Speech Communications class because of speaking in public.
I actually took it late evening class without too many students and even was scared and only had to speak in front of the professor.
What do you mean by that?
That's fair_comma_ having a father figure be present is really important.
I hate shark movies too. That's why I refuse to swim in the ocean.
The only way I'll get in is if I'm too drunk to care if I get eaten lol
Congratulations! That is great news to hear!
Yes! It is always good to have a positive attitude.
Life can have some sudden turns. But these are very little chances to count on and hope for
Good for him. But do not count on such things happening in life. They are very rare unless you put hard work to get them
That sucks_comma_ hopefully you can come back from that
That is usually pretty unlikely but I'm rooting for you.
That sounds nice_comma_ how long has it been?
Indeed_comma_ enjoy your time away!
What kind of games?
Oh I enjoyed board games when I was little too
oof sounds so bad
i bet it was
Oh no_comma_ that must have been embarrassing! 
Did anyone see it happen?
Wow_comma_ that must've been really scary!
I'm sure I would've been shaking as well!
What do you mean exactly? She doesn't have the same passion when speaking to you?
Oh wow_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that. That must hurt.
wow. are you ok? that can be really unnerving 
i would be to. people need to be more aware on the road
thats very cute to do that
yea i bet it does
I love watching heavy storms with thunder and lightening!
Yeah_comma_ as long as it is loud but not too close I usually love it!
That sounds terrible_comma_ I hate losing a pet...
Did you end up getting another ever?
That's great! It's such a good feeling working with people you actually like..
I hope you have more nights like it!
That's great! What are some things you're enjoying about life right now?
Oh man_comma_ having weekends off is such a deal breaker for me too. 
Kids are sweet. They will do everything to get what they want. So_comma_ did her mom made him Kraft Dinner eventually?
Don't be upset about it. Kids do not yet have conscious ability to think concretely in terms of other's feelings
That's very nice of you. I hope she gets the issues sorted out!
Yes_comma_ I can imagine it must be hard for you as well. I wish you guys all the best.
that is terrible. nevermind being embarassed i would have been mad and hungry!! 
i dont blame you
That's a good sign you did great then@
Good luck! I hope you get it.
Oh no! I would have asked for the manager! What did you do?
I can't imagine why that person would do that! So unreasonable.
Was there any reason you couldn't go? Did they not invite you?
That's wonderful! I hope you had or have a great time!
That's so cool! I really wish I had a dog!
I really like cats but I want a dog at some point.
Ugh_comma_ I hate when that happens. Do you think the cat ate something bad?
I bet. Poor kitty_comma_ I hope he/she feels better soon.
i bet it did i would be too
i bet it is_comma_ good luck with tha
Oh yeah I hate rats too actually.
Oh wow that sounds so scary! I might have done the same actually!
I am not a fan of snaked either.
I once was bitten by a snake_comma_ luckily it had no venom.
Sorry to hear that. Must feel quite lonely for you.
Luckily you can always contact your husband to see how he is doing and hear his voice.
Oh no_comma_ did you tell them?
If it's not bad_comma__comma_ I wouldn't tell them
haha_comma_ welcome to Tinder! It's the app of mixed signals. Did things work out finally?
Yeah_comma_ usually you just move on. There are plenty more fish in the sea!
I know what you mean_comma_ scary movies really terrify me!
That's always a great way to make me feel more at ease!
Same here_comma_ who accused you?
Frick isn't a curse word.
Same here! What makes you nervous>
Yeah that's the same reason as me.
that is bad news. my mother is going through the same thing unfortunately. landlord became widowd and now is moving with her daughter in anothe state so will be selling the house
that is tough. my mothere also has her little dog. but more than likely she will move in with my family
Double the fun_comma_ are these your first children?
Congrats_comma_ you should try to sleep some thou.
You sound very confident! how will you make that happen?
great! I wish i could find a profitable business.  i don't like worker for other people.
I have not seen those but that sounds cute. Are you married?
Yep there's nothing wrong with either of those things!
I hate those kind of storms for good reasons.  We have lightning storms all the time in Georgia.  The power is more than likely to go out.
Yes indeed_comma_  I've had to deal without power for 48 hours the last bad storm.  Almost three years ago_comma_ I was actually struck by lightning while in my home. 
thats so cool_comma_ nice job of him'
thats great good for you.
Oh that's great news!
You are a good friend I think
Really? That's insane!
Cool_comma_ that sounds like a great weekend!
I do not like Tinder. What did she do?
That is too bad_comma_ don't give up hope thou.
Oh that is pretty terrifying! What caused it?
Oh that's a relief though!
That could have been a scary situation. How was the party?
That's good. I guess you never know what to expect sometimes.
I love Disney World_comma_ who are you going with?
Hopefully you have enough time to see all the parks.
Oh no! Don't blame yourself. It happens
Better luck next time!
thats a fair point
yea i bet it is
That's great_comma_ how did it go?
Yep that's the way to do it!
that would be cool. do you have singing experience ?
so am i .im a guitar player_comma_ not a singer
Did you figure out a way to pay it thou?
That was very nice of her.
Aw that's the worst_comma_ especially when the clothes are new!
That's pretty annoying that nobody told you!
Wow_comma_ that's good for him. What do you think changed for him?
That's cool! It's always good to hear when people decide to take a good step forward.
Are you happy for him?
Do you have a girlfriend?
I've never even heard of that before!
Oh cool! Sounds like fun!
why do you say that? are you worried about the current state of affairs?
He may not.  He has certainly made a few enemies.
Oh_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that about your grandmother.  I'm close to my grandmother so I would definitely need for the doctors to provide the best of care.  I'm sure you are looking for a speedy recovery.
That's a great position to take especially when something like this occur.  It puts so many things in perspective on what's important.  I'm glad you have good doctors so you can focus on just being there for her.
Oh no! I always like to pick out what I'm wearing the night before. Maybe that would help?
It really could help. I heard Einstein used to wear the same clothes everyday because it would help him stay focused on his studies! 
eh its worth it tho
still worth it imo
That was nice of them_comma_ did you pay them?
That was nice_comma_ you should help them next time.
What did you get him?
Does he grill a lot?
Why would you do that?
Oh so it was your work? That's understandable then.
Wow that doesn't sound like a very good relationship. Did you talk to her about it?
Wow I'm sorry I hope you can figure something out!
Good for you. I had couple of interviews couple of years ago. Was very nervous_comma_ but thankfully they all went well. My advice_comma_ just try to hide your nervousness and show confidence
So when are you expected to hear back for final decision on your hire?
thats understabled i get it
i get what you meam
what?!?! how? what happend if you dont mind me asking
wow. glad to hear you are ok
Oh no! Did she move away from your city?
Well hopefully you feel better about the situation. It will hurt for awhile.
You must of been so proud of him.
Will he be going to college?
Did you get the B?
That is great news_comma_ good job.
Oh that sucks. What role were you applying for?
Cool_comma_ sorry to hear that you didn't get it.
How did he do that?
That is great_comma_ do you ever help him study?
I'm not that into sports. What do you like about them?
That's fair_comma_ good for them then!
Aww.. I am so sorry for your loss. It is so hard to lose our loved ones. 
It sometimes helps to remember the good times you had together.  
Oh no! What had happened?
Geez_comma_ hopefully they get caught someday for driving so reckless. Good to hear you are okay.
thats smart of you
i would always do that
That sounds great_comma_ it's always nice to have a new place to play like that!
Glad you have a place like it to enjoy
How long dd you do that for?
The cat must of got tired.
Where did you meet her?
That was brave of you to talk to her.
That's always a good idea. I respect that.
That's a good way to be a parent. They will grow up to be more honest and respectable.
How long has he been in the Navy?  I have a bonus son (my son's best friend) who has been in the Navy for about a year now.
That's a nice commitment.  My father is an Air Force veteran.  I'm not too fond of the military_comma_ but it definitely makes a difference in the lives of many.
Yes_comma_ I love 80s rock n roll.
Yes_comma_ I wish I could go back in a time machine.
Ugh_comma_ tell me about it. Her and Trump both make me feel that way.
He doesn't really say anything of substance in my opinion. Just vague words. But hey_comma_ to each his own!
Does she come over every day?
Maybe you should cook for her one night.
I am sure a B or A- is just as good.  Which class was it?
Ohhh that's a hard subject. I struggled with physics a lot_comma_ but not as much as chemistry.
That's so lucky! How much did you win?
That's a good amount_comma_ cool!
Are you going to see her again?
I thought you hit it off thou?
wow i would be so sad if i saw that
yea i would die if i saw that
Oh god_comma_ what happened?
I'm glad you are okay. That sounds terrifying!
Congratulations. That is very good luck you had. To be honest_comma_ i am not really interested in those scratch tickets as i think they are just waste of my hard earned money
Good. But my advice to you is do not count on them too much as they have astronomically low chances of winning even anything at all
Holy cow_comma_ that's a large limit! And I thought my $2500 limit was decent!
Just be careful and don't get too excited and start swiping it all over!
Wow_comma_ that's pretty impressive! Have you been training a lot?
That's awesome to have that type of dedication.
When is her birthday?
Where will you have the party?
Where did he meet her?
Not when_comma_ where I asked?
I hope so too! So are you a teacher or substitute or what?
What kind of math do you teach?
What did you steal from him?
Why don't you return it?
Same_comma_ especially being as attractive as he is.
He pretty much has everything at this point.
Where and when did this happen?  I haven't looked at the news lately to avoid hearing sad news.  The last incident of the duck boat accident was very saddening.
Oh wow.  I will definitely need to look at that.  Was there many casualties?
I think kids should all be home schooled.
They can hire teachers to come to the house.
I love tacos! Do they serve other mexican food?
Sounds delish! I really like Moes southwest grill. If you get the chance you should try it.
Sorry to hear that_comma_ will you get another dog?
Do you have any other pets?
That's non fun. I'm sorry to heard that. Maybe you shouldn't go there anymore?
The food is not very healthy so you are not missing much
thats no fun! i love to swim and be in the pool or beach. but i work too much to go
yes you should. its not hard!
I love cruises_comma_ where is your cruise headed?
Have you ever been there before?
Sorry to hear that. It's tough when unexpected things like that happen.
Man_comma_ the tax system needs a complete overhaul. Hope things work out for you in the future.
Did you tell him you wanted it?
Will he buy you a cake when you shop next time?
You sound very confident! What sport do you play?
That sounds fun! I like boats_comma_ but I don't think I would be a good rower.
What plane crash are you referring to?
I never heard about it. I'm glad nobody died though!
Why don't you do the same thing?
All you can do is keep working hard.
Happy Birthday to You!  I love birthdays so much.  Just recently celebrated by youngest daughter's 14th birthday on August 9th and my granddaughter's 4th birthday on August 10th.  When is/was your birthday?
My daughter just had a nice birthday dinner with family.  My granddaughter had a couple of parties. What kind of party do you plan on having?
Won't you enjoy less chaos?
The kids can always visit you.
Have you ever talked on the phone at movies yourself?
Well Its always fun to get the people on their phones thrown out of the movie theater
That's awful! What kind of car do you have?
Those are good cars.  I have a volkswagen beetle and I love it!
Make a pizza_comma_ it is a fail safe choice.
Yes_comma_ pizza with some olive oil and balsamic vinegar dipping. 
Did you get hurt or just your car?
I hope they caught the guy.
I hope it's not Game of Thorns??
I need to look it up_comma_ never heard of it.
That is a well trained dog_comma_ how did you get it to respond like that.?
My dog is the worst_comma_ Always crys_comma_ he is pretty young. But I wish he was like your dog.
Uh oh_comma_ that sounds bad.  Is it your wife?
Do you know who it is?
those are always good memories
i agree. no one can ever take those from us
Aw that sounds sweet. You're wonderful for doing that and I'm sure you can't wait to get there!
I hope everything goes well for you!
what kind_comma_ is she alive?
Too bad_comma_ is you window broken now?
Did you threw it back into his car?
Unfortunately there are people like that in this world_comma_ but maybe they can change someday.
were you happy to see him after that long time?
seeing the people you love in real life feels always different_comma_ i'm glad you were happy!
Yes_comma_ I think people that work these jobs should call in sick when they are not in a mood.
Same here_comma_ CS is just as important as the products we buy.
Did you end up reading any reviews on it first?
Well you should take a leap of faith and go in with an open mind.
Did you go back?
That was very nice of him.
Great_comma_ for what store?
It's rare this days for people to hand make gifts or anything.
Why didn't you ?
Did they get mad at you?
were you shocked it happened so fast?
best to block her in every way so you don't hear about her life
What happend? Do you have test results pending?
Well what you should do first is be with your family and those who care about you.
Cool_comma_ where did you go?
This is a trail where you can walk for months?
I love coming home too. 
I just love relaxing here. My favourite thing is no neighbours !
really? what was it about?
that sounds so interesting!
Is this your first time?  I know that is something that I would even ever consider.  My fear of heights would render me completely lifeless.  So are you doing the real skydiving or in one of these indoor skydiving places?
Well_comma_ I am working my way up to taking a flight across the oceans perhaps one where I'm in a plane in the sky for over 8 hours.  Outside of that_comma_ I will give it to you that you are really brave.
If your son is very young and you give him an allowance then tie it to that!
Haha sadly it does not. I still hold off on doing it in my own apartment at 26. Unless they are very young I don't think here really is a good way unless it smells
how what made you feel? do tell
wow!! that sounds horrible! i cant believe she even tried to get your number! did you give it to her? hahah
man what happened next_comma_ i would have been looking for a place to hide
I bet that was a relief and pretty funny when you look back on it.
That sounds like your job is going well.
I bet you feel really respected and welcome there.
That's great for your sister_comma_ but you must have felt left out.
Did she invite you another year?
Did you have fun when you got to go?
I guess learning to appreciate positives and get past negatives is part of life :)
What instrument do they yplay?
Oh that's great! You must be very proud.
do you have all your gear ready to go ?
that sounds fun but dangerous at the same time_comma_ is it ?
Oh no! You must have been pretty frustrated.
That's great that you had someone to help you.
Oh yeah? Are you excited?
That's great. I hope you have a wonderful time.
Oh no_comma_ i bet that is frustrating. Have you ever used him before?
I cant stand noisy pipes. I hope he is able to fix it for you. 
That's a bummer. Sorry to hear that but I am sure you can reschedule_comma_ right?
I would be to if I were in your shoes.  I would be very disappointed too.
Awesome_comma_ I love pasta. 
What did you have?
Lol that sounds wild_comma_ did you text them something appropriate?
Hopefully he can take constructive criticism_comma_ I think more people should be open to that.
That's the worst! What did you do?
Saved you the money from having to call pop a lock.
Awww how sweet. is he your only child? It does get easier....
I felt the same way when my youngest started school. They grow up so fast. 
I just cannot understand why people won't do their job properly_comma_ I had to cut my lunch break in order to do more work
That is so sad_comma_ they don't seem to understand workers.
That is nice from you. What card is it?
Why did you do that?
Oh wow_comma_ that sounds unfortunate. Is there no way to ask the neighbor to take it easy?
That sounds terrible. I hate to hear single mothers dealing with extra problems like these. If anything I would advise your son to be careful and defend himself.
Aw_comma_ good on her. I bet she knew exactly how it would make you feel_comma_ too. Things people do personally themselves always have the better result.
Now it's your turn! Surprise her with something that will remind her of something special too. People hate to hear it_comma_ but our parents are only with us for so long_comma_ and when they're gone we have so many regrets. Use that as a motivator
I know that feeling_comma_ so frustrating!  Do you think there's a chance the person will change?
I'm sorry!  Maybe you could try distancing yourself from this person_comma_ you have to protect yourself first.
Oh god..They do that to me TOO! And we have poison water! Are they going to fix it?
Oh..the phone part is the worst! And being transferred and re-telling the story! I am glad they reversed it though! Most companies won't!
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have a plan to change things?
That's terrible_comma_ but good for you for having a plan. You'll get through it_comma_ your happiness is the most important thing!
Oh that is nice! Why did they move back?
Oh fantastic! I am sure they are happy to be home.
That happens sometimes but I'm sure you will make a lot of new friends in your new job.
That is good_comma_ maybe you can still hang out with them outside of work.
Could it be fixed at all? 
I am sorry to hear that but luckily noone got hurt.
How excited are you? I did not know they still made those.
That is awesome. Just in time for the weekend. Dont forget to get up and stretch every so often.
Whoa that is awesome. I could never be on that show.
I cant wait to watch. You must be beyond excited.
Just keep trying and you will eventually land something
NEver know until you try!
oh really? What kind of girls?
Maybe even a little jealous?  I don't blame you.
Oh no! How frustrating! What did you do?
What caused it?
Wow_comma_ congratulations! Did you save up a long time for it? What kind of car is it?
I love that model_comma_ man I'm jealous. I bet it was agonizing to have to save and resist the temptation_comma_ but wow it's so worth it now_comma_ huh?
You are going to love that thing for a long time_comma_ seriously congratulations!
Good for him. So where did he go? I will make a guess. Is it Miami?
Well_comma_ if i had enough money_comma_ i would travel the whole world. But unfortunately_comma_ i have to be at work even during summers
That is great_comma_ do you have any other classes this summer?
I am very impressed!
Thats awful! Is she changing her diet?
My aunt had this and if you get off all saturated fats_comma_ it really cleans your arteries out.
Were you drunk or tired?
That's unfortunate_comma_ hopefully they develop or allow you access to some medicine that can help you manage that pain. Especially considering how frequent it can be.
You are so lucky_comma_ and must be really excited!
I wish you the very best and much success. I hope it's a million times better than your old job.
Congrats! That sounds like a lot of fun. Do you already have a bike?
That's awesome. I hope the weather is good for your first ride.
Oh!  Were you really scared?
I am happy you all are OK!  I would have been terrified as well!
Who was in your family?
Yes it has been too hot for too long
I apologize I thought we were discussing Winter coming soon
Where did you get the money for it?
Good friends are invalueble.
I know how you feel... people also get married and have kids.
Was it a slow leak or was it somethign else?
As long as you have an easy way to fill it up.
That's great news! I find most people are good_comma_ honest folk. It's the few rotten ones that make us forget that.
That's so nice of you. As I said_comma_ most people are very nice. You at least now have peace of mind.
Wow_comma_ Did you see a doctor?
That is good.
Do you expect it to be positive?
If your review is good_comma_ could you get a bonus?
That is good_comma_ are you going to have a nap?
What do you do to relax?
That's great. Do you get a bonus?
That's great. What do you sell?
That must be such a relief to get another semester behind you. It's hard waiting to get your grades though I'm sure.
Best wishes to you on your upcoming courses. I have a feeling you will be very successful.
Well_comma_ it is good you have a friend that is so close to you that you feel comfortable sharing with them. 
Trust is a hard thing to find_comma_ I am so glad you found this bond with this person.
That's so annoying. Maybe you should leave earlier next time too.
oh
About what/
I am not really a football fan but it is fun to be a part of something!
Really?  What did they do to impress you so much?
Wow!  That sounds amazing and complicated!  Now I understand why you were positively surprised!
That is great. Did you watch all Harry Potter movies?
I like also a lot Harry Potter movies.
did it bring a lot of memories?
yeah there's nothing like the good old days
Well_comma_ that wasn't a very nice thing to do! Think of it as getting a new beard_comma_ rather than losing the old friend.
I don't think you're overreacting. That is something important to you and they should have realized that. Maybe it's time for new friends?
Yeah_comma_ I have a few "friends" like that. We hang out now and again_comma_ but there are others I'd rather spend my time with.
That's nice of her.  What was the occasion?
Ha that's nice of her! Well if you haven't had your wedding yet_comma_ I hope it turns out super nice!
That must be stressful to your friend.
That's good that you are content with what you have. 
Omg that must have been really embarrassing. Did anyone came to your rescue?
Haha. I can just imagine you running away. 
Oh that is so nice! Was it a special occassion?
That's lovely. I love when people just give small gifts to each other for no reason.
Hows that working out for you.
I once lost a wallet with a heavy sume of ash in it and I tried to have faith tht I would find it or some I trusted would find it and return it back to me.
Yes_comma_ you were just mentioning it. What happened?
Did you have your wallet returned to you? If it's your relative I think that everything should work out for good.
Oh that is so wonderful! How old is he?
That's so sweet. 
That was nice of you. What kind of soup.
That sounds really good!
Where did he go? Is he calling you?
I understand.
That's annoying. Have you talked to your boss about it?
That can be tough. Hopefully she'll understand.
Oh that is great! I have had great success doing keto and fasting for not feeling so hungry! Carbs and sugar do me in! What kind of lunches do you make?
true! I don't mind the same things. You can do healthy_comma_ it just takes more prep and ingredients sometimes to do it tasty and healthy
That's horrible! What happened to you? Who stabbed you in the back?
That's really difficult to deal with. When you love someone_comma_ you lower your guard for that person and more than anyone else they're the ones that can hurt you the most. I hope you find a resolution to your problem.
That sounds interesting_comma_ I would love to get a piercing. Where will you be getting the piercing?
Darn it! I have never seen that before_comma_ now I am would like to see what it looks like
Oh no! I would be so angry! 
That's so wrong. Id speak to a supervisor
Wow_comma_ I bet he was really surprised he got to meet him. What did he think of him in person?
That's great. It's good to see celebreties be the same in real life as they are on the internet or TV.
Oh god_comma_ I hate flying. I always seem to get the plane that ends up having some issue.
Yeah_comma_ I will drive almost anywhere rather than fly if I can.
Haha.. I'm sorry_comma_ that made me laugh a little bit. I do that sometimes too_comma_ and have no idea how I can forget so many times. I think at least if it happens_comma_ almost no one can really tell or notice_comma_ if that helps.
Well_comma_ you could have been going commando_comma_ too. And shame on them for not letting you know. Let's focus on the positives--you can pull off skinny jeans_comma_ and you're interesting enough to want to wear Superman underwear. Keep it up
Did the company not pay you well enough?
Well_comma_ that was a long time ago_comma_ I don't think you need to carry it around with you anymore_comma_ unless you're still doing it.
Gross. What did you do?
i think you could have removed them and still ate it. isnt that normal for them to have bugs in them sometimes?
That is amazing! I bet she had to work hard for that.
That's great. I think education is more important than ever
I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ hopefully she naturally mellows out.
Wow_comma_ that doesn't sound good. Situations like this are hard because you probably don't want to offend your family and stuff.
How exciting!  I remember when my girls said their first words!  What was his first word do you know?
Yeah_comma_ that seems to be what a lot of little ones say for their first word.  Something about it being easier than ma ma - congrats to the little tyke!
wow_comma_ good for her! I'm sure she worked really hard to get a degree
i'm sure she will be able to find a really great job now !
I am so sorry that you have to go through that on your day off. Just try to be nice to her.
Maybe you need to go to the store and bring her flowers and chocolate
I don't envy you there. I have done the blind family meeting at a holiday dinner before. It's nerve racking. 
Well_comma_ my advice is to give in now_comma_ because you probably will in the end anyway and avoid any extra arguing you two would do because of it.
Oh no_comma_ I am so sorry you have to leave your furbaby! Give her lots of extra snuggles and explain to her that you will be back and I am sure she will be delighted to see you upon your return!! Have you ever left her before?
I believe dogs can understand what you tell them_comma_ they understand if we say treat or ride after all lol. Maybe you could send a small blanket that smells like you or an old tshirt you have worn to bed. That may help her to feel more comfortable!
That's awesome!  Does he have any plans for what he's doing after high school?
That's great to hear!  Good luck to him!
Awesome! What does his new house look like?
Oh a pool! Inground or above ground?
Why did they left half of the trash?
Did you complain to municipality?
That's awful_comma_ what was he yelling at you about?
LOL.  Yeah_comma_ been there. Even when those guys do that and are wrong they typically never apologise. They just pretend like they weren't acting like a jerk.
AHHHHHHHHHH!  That is amazing.  I am so jealous of you.  Where are you going?
Where is that?
Have fun!  I'm sure you will.
Ah thats so bad. why not raise a complaint
Hope it get resolved soon
Oh no! Do they have. alost and found?
I hope you can figure it out soon!
Oh nice.  Is he the type to tone himself down in social settings...but he's secretly a wiz kid
Well gotta watch out for him...it's the quiet unassuming ones that are usually full of surprises
I call them hypocrites. They take advantage of people whenever it suites their needs. Can't stand the presence of such people
I knew a couple of people whom I suspected of fitting the description we talked here. And I tried to stay away from them as much as i could
I love dogs_comma_ and have three myself. What type of breed is the puppy?
I have two wiener dogs_comma_ and they are both spoiled brats_comma_ but I love them. You should be very happy with your girlfriend's choice of gifts.
Oh no!  What happened?  Do you think you did ok anyway?
That's sad to hear :(  That happened to me before and I came out ok in the end_comma_ I'm sure you will too :)
I know how you feel_comma_ my brother is my best friend but I only talk to him about once a month because he is so busy.  Where is your brother now?
Well_comma_ I hope you get to talk to him more and maybe can get over there for a visit!
Oh no! Did it leave a dent?
I know how you feel. If I had an accident like that I wouldnt be able to pay either.
Nice! How'd you do
That's pretty awesome.  How much richer are you now
Did this happen recently?
That is good that the person was courteous. That may not happen everytime
I'm sorry to hear that_comma_  Was it his fault?
That's good to hear. How did the other person fare?
Are you jealous by this or does it make you angry?
Are you going to be able to purchase the truck for yourself anytime soon?
True. Do you have any plans for the weekend? 
That sounds fun. I love going to the lake its so relaxing. 
That is awesome that you have such friendly coworkers!
Make sure you give each of them a thank you card
Did you find out what it was
Haha that's pretty funny
I'm glad you're feeling well_comma_ it's always important to make your health a priority_comma_ without our health we have nothing!
You sound very dedicated_comma_ that's great you're so focused on your health_comma_ you will age gracefully I'm sure!
That's disgusting. What kind of parent lets their child run around like that.
Yeah_comma_ really makes you want to touch anything in a store with booger hands wandering around putting his hands on everything.
Sweet! Wouldn't mind one myself. What do they cost new?
Woah! I could live for ten years on that. Hope you wrote down his tag - maybe you could sweet-talk him into going for a drive!
That is really mean. I am sorry.
That is so sad. Have you seen or heard from her again?
Do you think she will keep you awake? How old is she?
Maybe you can hide some of your things_comma_ or put them in a safe place. 
That is so amazing.  Animals have an amazing ability to find their way home.  I wonder if it was out there having a Homeward Bound style adventure.
That is so great_comma_ I'm glad you got your little friend back.
Oh that would kill to see. Maybe he will hook you up.
I would be very jealous. Dont let it get to you too much. At least it doesnt seem like you see him all that often.
Thats awesome. Do you look like him?
That is really nice to have found. I hope you hold onto them in a safe place.
A little homesick?  Are you traveling for vacation or for work?
I understand how you feel.  Maybe its time to change locations?
Oh my god_comma_ that is terrible. Has it affected you knowing you slept through that kind of event right next door?
I would have as well. I am sorry that happened to you and I hope you can learn to sleep peacefully again.
Yes_comma_ it's important to find somebody who you will be able to trust and also somebody who will love you for being you
that's great to hear! I hope you will meet your true love soon! I believe when you do you will now right away. When i met my husband i knew right away he is the one. such a strange feeling. But we've been married for 5 years now and still crazy about each other
Oh no! Can you ask for an extension? Sometimes they'll be quite accommodating.
That seems strange in this day and age. I thought everything could be done online. Perhaps you could hand deliver those parts.
Good. Where are you going?
I understand. Have a good trip. Are you traveling alone?
Now that is something I would imagine is hard to deal with. I hope you are in a better place.
You just have to keep working at it.
Oh that's terrible. I wouldn't shut it all out though_comma_ you could miss out on someone great.
Yeah you are right. Better to take things slow and figure out what they are all about first.
That's really kind of you. Not everyone can or will do that. I do hope she pays you back!
I'm sure! It's always nice to help someone in need_comma_ but you do hope they'll do the right thing by you when possible.
You're obviously a very good person and I'm sure your friend knows that - she'll repay you when she can.
Then you'll be fine :)
That's pretty heavy. I hope that doesn't discourage you from trying again in the future_comma_ especially with a rescue dog or something in that area. If you don't mind me asking_comma_ what happened?
I had never heard of that before. That sounds like tragic timing. And you're right_comma_ I probably shouldn't have brought up getting another one so soon_comma_ it just sounded like you'd be a good owner_comma_ since you seem like you care so much. It makes sense for you to not rush right back into it.
That is so great that he was able to go.  I had the same problem as you_comma_ but I started at community college when I was 26 and finished at a 4 year college when I was 32.  It is never too late for you to go.
They are the best.  I think it is good to go later_comma_ because you know what you want more and don't waste time and money.
Awesome. Is it the first ime?
Maybe you will a friend soon. Or even meet a nice guy.
That's horrible. Is it treatable?
I'm praying that she will be fully healed_comma_ and that you will take good care of her.
Everyone in life has problems_comma_ do not feel bad for sharing yours I hope it gets better for you.
You are welcome_comma_ I am glad I can put you in a better mood.
That's fantastic! It must be a good day for you.
I'm sure you were pretty nervous after you applied.
A little anxious?  Have you ever flown on a plane before?
I'm sure you'll be fine. Statistically its safer than driving.
That sounds cool. Do you go fishing a lot?
My dad really enjoyed fishing. I think I'd like the peace and quiet of it.
How awesome! She must be proud of herself! Where does she work?
It isn't easy to be successfully self-employed but she did it! 
That is awesome_comma_ how long have you been playing?
Have you thought about getting back into it?
Awesome! Do you think did well?
Nice_comma_ what job did you apply for?
These people are not people you see everyday. I wouldnt worry about it
Watch some youtube videos of other peoples misfortunes so you can forget about yours quickly!
Why would anyone make a party in a shady area? Was it your friend's party?
Probably it is just the theme of his party. He wanted to have some fun in the form of cautious excitement
Awe. That is soo sweet. You have some really good friends
That is really nice to have. Most people don't even have one good friend.
that is really such a pain_comma_ i remember when i had to do my paperwork for school it is not fum
well i really wish you very good luck with all that
That is so nice what kind was it?
That sounds so good I love coconut rum that would have made my birthday awesome I'm glad you enjoyed it. 
That would make me jealous. Do they let you ride in it or anythign?
I understand. That sounds frustrating
Why did they do that?
Crappy neighbors are crappy. That must have been pretty scary.
That's the worst.  No money and now hungry.
I know how that goes. I got a side job so I could help pay off debt to get a house.
Are you looking for one_comma_ or are you enjoying your singlehood?
That is true_comma_ but they are out there.  Keep looking and you will find one.  Where are you trying to find them?
It's great when you can be so confident after a interview. So I am guessing you got the job?
I am so glad to hear that for you. I hope this job goes really great for you for many years to come.
Oh no. What happened? Hopefully they will understand it was a mistake.
Oh I am sorry that happened. Hopefully they understand it was a simple mistake. 
Oh no.  Was the dog friendly?
Oh wow.  Are you sure it was not a coyote?  They are around a lot as well.
Awe. Have you named her already?
Thats such a sweet name_comma_ and very kind of you.
OMG so gross I would have been so mad where was your cat at the time.
Lol that is to funny have to be careful next time.
that is awesome_comma_ are you planning on doing anything to celebrate?
that is awesome_comma_ are you planning on doing anything to celebrate?
What kind of job is it?
Is that similar to what you do now? Sometimes change is good.
That's great!  I've had trouble with changing my diet before.  What kind are you doing?
I've heard that about keto.  I might just try it sometime!
That is awesome who is your favorite author hopefully you can meet that person now.
I never heard of him what is a name of the book your friend plans on writing with this author?
That is amazing_comma_ I never win anything.  What was the prize?
Holy cow_comma_ what a great prize.  Congratulations!
What age is he now?
I hope he can get over it soon!
Oh man! I would be so surprised! Where you happy for it?
I'm so excited! I want some cookies now! 
I do the same! I will be crossing my fingers for tonight's lottery! 
Oh that is awesome you are able to understand your mom now_comma_
That was very nice of them. So you didn't have to pay anything?
Wow! That is truly awesome. Congratulations
Why are you having second thoughts? I have been there.
I'm sure you will be great!
Oh I remember that movie. I used to watch it all the time. What was it like watching it again now?
I may have to go back and check it out.
I bet that was fun!
That's something we should all do more often!
I'm sorry to hear that.  How old is the cat?
Ohh no.  That is a long life for a cat_comma_ and I know that makes it even harder.  I hope she gets better!
That's disappointing. I know how that goes. Its happened to be before
Sorry :(
Doesn't rabies cause sensativity to light? Either way I would freak out...
Oh yeah_comma_ gotcha. I really don't like animals that are small and move quickly
What happened did he hurt your dog? 
Wow ave you put up signs for lost dog hopefully someone will bring him back home to you.
Wow! Maybe you have a hidden talent lol.
I don't see no reason you shouldn't try!
I would be too! Try and find a time you can go back and see them?
Oh man! That sounds great but bad at the same time! 
that is really sad to hear_comma_ i remember when i was a kid there was no problem even leaving the door unlock
have you contacted local police to warned them?
That seems a little odd.. It sounds like you guys don't have the best communication. Did she say why she didn't ask you?
I see. I'm not sure that's healthy_comma_ but it's also not my business. I hope that for both your guys' sake you are able to communicate a little more properly in the future. I don't think therapy on its own can work unless everyone is willing to listen to each other.
He did the right thing_comma_ how did the teacher react?
Well_comma_ you're doing a good job as a parent. There's no justification for what he's done but he had the strength of character to confess to the teacher when confronted. He's still a good kid even if he does bad things occasionally. I hope you guys can put this past you quickly.
That must be one special puppy for that drive! How adorable... are you going with him to pick it up? 
What a nice neighbor you have_comma_ awh well happy and congrats to you and the fam. 
That was very kind of you. It's nice to have good neighbors.
Well I hope you know that you're appreciated and that was a very nice thing to do.
That's a lot of food lol i bet he felt sick afterwards. I think i would try to do the same_comma_ just curious if i could eat that much
ewww. well_comma_ at least he got a shirt. right? lol
That's great! What did you win?
I don't blame you. I don't know anything about Horses_comma_ but congrats on winning the bet
I am sorry to hear that. Why didn't you get the promotion?
It shouldn't be based off the seniority. It should be based off skill and If you had the skill you should have gotten it.
how did the first day go ?
oh that stinks
What happens next week?
I bet that is exciting then. Are they happy too?
Oh no why is that?
I can see how that can be annoying. Have you talked to him about his drinking?
Aw man!  That stinks!  I never really win things.  Some people have all the luck.
I would be so jealous too!  Sorry you didn't win.  Keep trying!
Wow she must be extremely smart for her age. That is incredible.
I would be so proud of her. Im sure it will carry through the rest of her schooling.
It's really tough_comma_ isn't it?  I'm just getting to the end of that with my wife_comma_ she's almost back.  What are you going to do with your time?
That's always good.  At least you have something to do.  It'll be over in no time!
Dang! That stinks. Im sorry. Did they just leave without saying something?
Oh wow! Im sorry about that
that is annoying_comma_ did you contact the bank to report it stolen?
That is frustrating_comma_ maybe you should switch banks and keep separate accounts_comma_ or use a credit card instead.
That is unbelievably frustrating.  I know exactly what you mean.  What rules do they not respect?
Unbelievable!  Those are pretty simple rules to follow.  What are you going to do now?
Thats good. How was it?
Well_comma_ that's always good to hear. I am glad
I am so sorry to hear that.   What happened?
That is so awful.  I just hate to hear that.  How old was he?
Your car door? That's awful - did they at least leave you a note so you could contact them?
Disgusting. Did you contact the police? Walmarts have surveillance cameras in their parking lots. Perhaps they could find the culprit that way.
What's happening?
Oh yeah!  Mine started this week.  Its been great. ha ha
whats wrong ? just an older woman ?
oh i hope she starts feeling better soon!
You must be nervous. What's the speech about?
Do you give those speeches often?
It the trash can damaged?
That is so messed up.
How many years has it been since you seen your friend from school?
20 years is a long time to recall fun times.
I am glad to hear it. You must be quite content at this moment.
Enjoy this moment_comma_ and try not to think about the bad that has happened.
Thats the worst_comma_ is it a big dog or little dog? 
exactly! wow maybe you need to get some sort of bark device  that stops them from barking! 
Uh oh! What happend?
Oh no! Have you found him yet?
are you currently working ?
wow that was mighty nice of them
i am sorry to hear that. But atleast they are having fun
You should plan a surprise dinner for them and make their favorite dishes.
Ohhh_comma_ disgusting.  Did you say something to the flight attendants?
I can't blame you_comma_ I know I sure wouldn't.
I am just like you. I have road rage. I dont know what it is.
Same. I usually speed up to another car in another lane and just go the same speed as them. It makes it feel so good to see the other person pissed
Lol that is so funny how did you do that was anyone around?
Well at least you wasn't the only one next time double check for everything before hitting the shower.
Hopefully not! Sounds like you are atleast seeing a doctor which is good! I hope you feel better asap. 
:( Well i will pray that everything comes back good. 
That's horrible!  I would be too!  I have an older brother and have been right where you are.  What are you going to do?
Yeah_comma_ make him squirm.  He had better apologize. 
Oh no! what was it and what will you do?
That would make me so mad!
Oh no_comma_ what happened?
Did you find out who?
congrats_comma_ what are you having ?
wow that is great_comma_ good luck_comma_ your gonna need it with twins!
What happened?
Oh no! Is he okay?
Really? Thats so good for you. I also just started doing a little work out in the mornings. How long do you run for? 
Good for you keep it up. you will get there in no time. 
Oh? What did you end up doing with them?
That is pretty fun to do. I used to do that when i was in college with my family.
I can imagine. Just be cool and do as you have been taught!
Yes just have faith in yourself and your abilities! 
Oh! That's so nice isn't it? where were you coming home from?
Yes_comma_ I felt the same way when I went visit my dad up north. he is a great cook. i bet your mom is.
Oh no!  What's wrong with it?
That stinks.  I hope it hasn't done too much damage in the meantime.
I would be very angry to is there anyway to speak with a supervisor to explain what happened?
I hope so to get you paid or at least keep a strong relationship so in the future you can work with them again. It will work out.
What! My lord that is insane for real_comma_ thats a lot of weight. Deadlift or he kept going? 
Yeah right_comma_ crazy what our bodies can do. 
Oh no!  I'm so sorry! I have done that too!  Horrible!
Did you go all the way home?
I hope she feels better. I think its great she still has you to help out.
It is always best to be able to have family to lean on.
ooh! how may inches was the old one and the new one? would love a new tv.
I bet it will look amazing watching sports or playing video games
did you get the snake out? if not this is what you do_comma_ get a neighbors cat and place it in the area and wait till the snake is hungry. problem solved
ok then lets switch it up.. get a neighbors dog.. get some popcorn
why would somebody overeat for a silly t-shirt?! makes no sense to me
oh_comma_ i see. i don't think i would do that. I would throw up
I haven't either. What kind of music?
Oh that's cool. I like cover bands.
Awwwww!!! i love kittens_comma_ just adopted one. Was it adorable?
I bet. When I got my kitty her furr was still growing in. Shes adorable now though
that is so sad did you take him to the vet imidiatly
that is good i hope he recovers well from it
Oh man! I would be so excited for that! How many people where there?
I'm so proud of you! That had to be a lot of fun and a lot of effort 
It must be nerve wracking! Will you be contesting a ticket?
Oh my_comma_ sorry to hear that. These things are never easy. You must be strong in order to fight this.
Had it changed at all?  I hope not if you are just away for college.
Yeah it is crazy to see things we used to have in our lives every day years later.  Makes you wish you could go back to those days when everything was so easy.
That is great are they home school?
That is great you will teach and see your kids grow and because of you that is awesome.
yeah that makes me mad too
that is pretty disgusting
Damn that sucks_comma_ been there_comma_ my husband had an affair.
Did you end up taking her back?
oh yea? tell me where you live so when you do i know where to go to collect my share
wow thats a good split_comma_ what are you going to do with your 10 percent ?
i would have been as well we all need vacas_comma_ anywhere special to go? 
Sounds like a solid plan_comma_ you should go for it! Shoot for the moon. 
Sorry to hear about that. But I am glad to hear he's doing better now! 
Yep_comma_ genetic testing tech is really amazing. A life-saver in many cases! 
Oh man I would file a lawsuitttttttt
Right_comma_ Everyone needs a lawyer in their family_comma_ Im trying to get my little brother to be one Lol
Oh my_comma_ I think you should stock up on Vitamin C and hydrate yourself just in case.
I agree_comma_ hot chicken soup is the way to go. I hope its just the weather and not a cold
I can understand_comma_ I'm sure it has sentimental value.
I would probably keep it if I were you_comma_ more sentimental value than cash value anyway.
I remember those. The light up ones were the coolest.
Thank goodness! A pleasant change from fidget spinners and fortnite.
That is very nice of you. You two must be really good friends.
You are very trusting. Its nice to have a friend like you. Im sure she appreciates it.
I would have been too! Do you always take it to work? 
i get it me too i like my own personal space. 
That is heart breaking! My pitbull died a year ago and I still miss him like crazy.
You too. Animals are just the best
Oh_comma_ How amazing!  So cute seeing kittens jump!  What kind of kitten do you have?
Beautiful!
I would be too! Were you stuck working late?
Ugh that is just the worst.
how did you get better? 
oh that is good that you had the time
That was rude of them. Why?
Wow_comma_ I would go over and talk to that boss and demand an apology
What's going on next week?
Yay! That is one of the best days of the year!
what was the issue that needed fixing?
well it looks like they fixed it !
I know how you feel. I have not seen mine as well as we all live so far away
Yep_comma_ I hardly talk to them. even less to my dad.
Oh scary! What happened?
Pesky kitties! 
It is to me. I dont know how people do it
hahaha_comma_ same! If I took time though I could probably learn how to 
it is the best i once went to italy and the food over there is great
i went to rome the food over there is great
How did that happen? I hope it wasn't a case of break-in and entering.
Understandably so. Who doesn't clean up after themselves?
You must have been very hopeful about your prospects! 
I am happy for you that you are pursuing your passion.
I know the feeling. I lived far away from my parents in college. It does get better.
I had to try to make friends and see my parents when I could. I wish you luck.
Wow that must be awful. 
That's fair. Space is good
I bet that made quite a mess
i feel the same way with my dog sometimes.  always making a mess
Flies are the most annoying bugs to have in the house. Finally did you get rid of it?
Let's hope no more flies infiltrate your home!
I hate working when it rains hard.
I guess so_comma_ where do you work?
That's so nice! Does he enjoy playing team sports?
Haha_comma_ well it's good for kids to socialize when they are younger.
dont bee nervous about it panic only makes it worst how are you handling it?
well i really wish you the best and hope everything goes well
I don't blame you. I don't have a sister but I wouldn't want my things taken.
I would need them to replace it. You don't break a bunch of my stuff with no ramifications.
Did you have them set up for a while like decor? 
Thats really a bummer then_comma_ I hope you can get them back together. 
I'm guessing it didn't work right?
Sounds to me like you've made some good decisions in your life to land you in marriage_comma_ awesome!
That would be a nice surprise_comma_ now you need not go buy any hangers
Now you can take care of your close in your closet without spending any extra money. You saved time and money.
That's always fun! What book was it?
Interesting_comma_ I've never read it before. I will have to check it out!
OH wow! Did you accept the candy?
Usually humans are really good at sniffing out weirdness like that. Glad you didn't take it!
Oh no! How did that happen??
Lol_comma_ that could happen to the best of us.  Hopefully it you were able to put it behind you quickly and didnt let it ruin your night!
I'm so so sorry to hear that_comma_ it can't be easy being in that position. Have you spoken to anyone close to you about it?
Definitely. Not to make this about me_comma_ but I've had a lot of issues in my life that simply got worse over time because I kept it to myself.
Yeah_comma_ that's always fun! Did you get a lot of money back?
That's no fun. I once had to pay in about a $1000 so count yourself lucky!
It is crazy how long it takes to get everything unpacked in a new house.  Are you loving the new place?
Congratulations on the new place!
 I'm sorry to hear that. I understand they can live a really long time. Was it an old parrot?
That's sad to hear. I'm sure he lives a great life none the less.
thats always a really hard thing.  youll have a good time though
ive been there.  But get out there and meet some new people.  go get drunk and go to a party
Oh my_comma_ I would have been shocked. Wow did you react to finding this?
Yes maybe it was for the best time. Hopefully you will someone better. 
Wow_comma_ that's so caring and lovely! You must enjoy it a lot.
I've never volunteered for an animal shelter but I would like to get into it once I have more time on my hands. I love animals.
How much does the damage cost?
Are you uninsured?
Whats the point of having an insurance company if you can't use it?
Why was that?
That's pretty bleak. Sorry to hear that.
Well I hope he cleared it up - that is not a nice thing to wake up to!
I would pick it up and throw it all over his yard! But then I'm a little on the vindictive side_comma_ lol!
I've had that feeling as well_comma_ especially if it is with someone that is close to me.  Is it because you dont like confrontation or a different reason?
I used to have social anxiety as well.  I dont recall the names off the top of my head but some self help books with the topic have helped me in the past!
I used to be that way too.  One thing to think about that might help is even if you do look stupid for a second nobody is going to remember 10 minutes from then.  Another thing that helped me was thinking about how good it felt if a stranger started talking with me in public for a 2-5 minute conversation and how it didnt upset me or make them look stupid so I shouldnt look stupid if I did the same thing.
Oh really_comma_ do you feel like you did a great job?
Thats good_comma_ it must be relieving to feel so confident.
oh yea.. whats that?
Oh nice.  where can I find it?  Netflix?
I'm sorry to hear that. How long were you together?
Did you do something to cause the breakup?
Oh no! That's a lot of money. Did you get any of it back?
Doesn't give anyone the right to steal it_comma_ tho'. I'm so sorry - how awful for you. I hope they had a horrible time when they tried to spend it!
Oh geez_comma_ stay safe!  Tornadoes are one of those weird things for me.  They sort of scare me but before they happen and its raining yet still outside I love going out to see whats happening.
hahaha_comma_ I dont know if people today would rather lose electricity or get a tornado.  Either way I hope you stay safe and if a tornado does come you dont take any damage!
It is important to have a focus on something positive.
Nothing in life is certain_comma_ the only control you have is to decide what to do with the time that has been given to you.
That must mean they think you're a pretty cool person! People usually don't go through that kind of effort unless they think you're worth it and deserve it. So_comma_ kudos to you for having that kind of effect on others!
Oh_comma_ you don't work with them anymore? Or maybe it was because you decided to be a stay-at-home mother? 
You may need to go to the barber shop!
The barber shop is totally worth it. They do such a good job.
That's terrible! I hope it didn't end up inside them?
Okay well that's good at least. I hope you find it soon!
Well that was rude_comma_ did you confront him?
I would ask him how it went and casually say "I would have gone had you asked".
That's awesome!  You're really lucky.
I'm sure it took a lot of hard work to get to that point!
Oh man! That sucks! Did anyone happen to see it?
I am sorry you have to deal with that. What a pain!
Congratulations! That sounds like a lot of great news in one month!
I really hope it does. Just stay positive!
What did you find out??
Oh wow_comma_ are you excited?? I would assume so if you agreed to go on a date.  I hope you guys have a great time!
I'm so curious. What happened at church?
Oh little mistakes like that happen_comma_ it's no big deal!
You hate it when what happens?
Oh yeah_comma_ that it the worst. Were you able to wash it out at least?
I get really anxious too. What are you having surgery on?
I've had that done before.  The waking up with gauze in your mouth is the worst part.
did it bring back a lot of memories?
yeah there's nothing like the good old days 
Good for you.  How is it going?
Pretty good here - just a homeschooling mom of 2 trying to get some laundry done.  I'm glad you are on the path you want to be on!
Was it good?
Lol I love a good Jason Statham movie
What made you blush so hard?
Hey you have got to do what you have got to do. Hopefully next time you're closer to home when you need to go.
Did you watch it late at night? I rarely watch scary movies.
I dont blame you. You are going to have to watch them during the day next time.
That sounds exciting!
How old is your nephew?
Yeah_comma_ glasses suck but_comma_ so does not being able to see. Good that your class mates are nice people.
Yep_comma_ I've got terrible eyes. I know what you mean.
Oh well that would have been embarrassing_comma_ but if you were trying to shed a few pounds I would say your doing a great job! 
Go buy you some new snazzy belts! Haha!
What kind of job is it?
Thats interesting!
I know how you feel. What helped me was getting a bicycle and get out in the sun for some exercise.
I feel you. Well it sounds like you keep yourself busy with a hobby at least. 
That is really something to be thankful for. I have lost 2...So for sure!
It's okay! Life happens! Cherish your babies always :)
Where did you go shopping?
I love the thrift stores. i can spend hours in there.
I buy a lot of kids clothes from there. I also go to a salvage store called Dirt cheap_comma_ great deals!
Sounds like a cool Goodwill.
Do you feel like you are prepared?
Well make sure you get a good nights rest_comma_ sleep is just as important.
wow thats horrible.  I hate the way they make the system to steal money
Maybe it might be worth trying again now_comma_ with another doctor?
I saw it when I was much older but my parents didn't let me watch it when I was young.  I bet.  That wouldn't be like real life for really being left home alone. 
I forgot about that part!  Yes!  Terrifying!  Hope you didn't have too many nightmares over it.
I didnt have an interview.  did you?
I hope you get it too.  Goodluck
Wow! Did she say yes?
Sorry to hear that. Are you breaking up with her?
Oh no_comma_ I'm sorry.  What went badly?  One things or just lots of little things?
I completely get it.  Hope things are better tomorrow!
Oh fantastic! What did you guys do?
By her you mean wife?
That's so embarrassing_comma_ but hey everyone has those moments once in a while. 
Good idea! And if ever you go back_comma_ just take it slow and easy.
that's sad_comma_ bad memories ?
yeah i understand you_comma_ but people change and we learn from them and that helps us grow more_comma_ don't take it too personally 
Oh good luck man! Hopefully everything works out! 
We can only hope so! Get her some flowers! 
Hm_comma_ thats not good. How so_comma_ if I may ask?
Sounds like quite a problem! I think you should try different foods and narrow down which ones trouble you.
WHAT? Do live in california?
That is so awful! Did you have insurance??
He sounds like he got really lucky. I'd be pretty jealous of him if I were you.
Well_comma_ that's not a very friend like thing to do.
THAT'S AMAZING_comma_ what test was it?
algebra? WOW i love maths_comma_ that sounds great i am so happy
Oh no_comma_ what did you do?
Oh no!  Does he know you did it or did you never tell him?  Yeah_comma_ we all have things we regret_comma_ its how we move forward and resolve the situation that matters.
Wow that must of been such a great surprise.
Dang he should clean my house too then while i am gone.
No way! Congrats!!! I bet you feel really excited.  How long had you been developing it?
I bet_comma_ 4 years is a long time to work on a project too.  I may not know you but as someone who had once wanted to get into development_comma_ I feel really proud for you.  That is a huge accomplishment! Congrats again!
haha! I hear you! It helps if you have more money to save too!
Lol! Well that would be great. Give me some of that luck! ;)
Where are yours and what's going on withthem?
So sorry to hear that...wish you blessings and health and peace
that was so nice of her i bet you was so happy you much be very special to her
one day i wanted a rabbit and my mom got me one she told me not to feed it food and i gave it house food and it die lol
I guess neither do I_comma_ sorry to hear about your rabbit though.
Yes its a good lesson for you_comma_ hopefully you dont repeat it!
Your a pretty tough guy and you have the wits too dude. You got this.
Like i said you got this and going in with a positive mine you might as well take the world while your at it.
Aww_comma_ that's sweet. I love animals! They love you unconditionally.
Uh oh_comma_ someone's in trouble! It's funny how smart dogs can be sometimes. They were trying to butter you up before you saw what they did!
Oh no I hope you didn't spend much on it 
That's such a shame! I always hate getting let down 
Aw you must have felt really nostalgic in that moment. Sounds like a great memory.
I would highly suggest you do. Moms deserve all the love.
Ugh hate when that happens...do you live alone or with roommates
Man I woulda smacked him on the head...lol rotting food/dirty dishes are the worst
How did it go?
I hope it does.
wow_comma_ thats horrible. what were they stealing?
thats horrible.  im glad they got caught
That's cool. Sounds like you're an animal person
If you could..would you get a cat or a dog
I agree_comma_ but maybe you should be a little less aggressive 
I dont know_comma_ I just wouldnt be that aggressive. I'd still try to protect her though
oh im sorry to hear that_comma_ what caused this?
no one deserves this_comma_ this is the worst thing that can ever happen_comma_ im sorry to hear that 
That's fantastic_comma_ you must feel really confident in your ability.
Do you receive feedback often?
That must have been nostalgic. When did you last pick one up?
What a beautiful game_comma_ hey?
Oh no!  Was it expensive items?
That is so awful.  I am so sad that happened to you.
Interesting! I could see how you thought that. Just because they're homeless and have fallen on hard times doesn't mean they're dumb. But yeah_comma_ there's a good chance they did something wrong to be in that predicament_comma_ so their judgment could be questionable. 
You're right_comma_ sorry for putting words in your mouth. And yeah_comma_ I don't know how to engage with them either. As a college student_comma_ there are plenty that kind of stalk the campus and ask for spare change. But I have little spending money_comma_ so I always have to turn them down
Haha I"m terrible with names too.  But for me there are only 2 types of people: ones that are memorable and ones that are boring and if you're boring I definitely won't remember who the hell you are
That's good.  Don't be so hard on yourself.  People should be begging for your attention. Not the other way around ;)
That is very lucky! Did you see who dropped it?
Oh wow! Lucky you!
Is everything going perfectly?
That's good!
I get that! What show is it?
I have never heard of it_comma_ I did watch the movie though. It would have been cool if they got Jennifer garner and Ben Afleck in it
Oh no! Was anything taken?
You're very lucky!
We all have weeks like that. Don't be too hard on yourself. Everything will get done eventually.
That must be hard_comma_ I'm sorry. Just do what you can though. I would help if I could.
Thats great. Im sure it was cheaper than having to buy a brand new one.
I bet. The grass has been growing so fast right now. Your yard is going to look great again.
Oh my goodness! 3 months?! Where are you going?
That is amazing! What places do you want to visit the most?
That sounds like a great way to keep yourself motivated! 
Everyone needs some way to keep them going! 
What kind of job?
Well confidence is key so I bet you will get the job :)
oh no_comma_ how did it happen? were you in a hurry?
this is the worst_comma_ i can understand why you are mad_comma_ i'd be the same as you_comma_ argh im sorry
Oh my_comma_ that is tragic. I hope you are there to support him.
Good of you. Times like these can be tough and he needs all the support he can get.
That is pretty hard my dude. But join some clubs or get to know some people in your dorm area.
Also try joining a club you might end up in apartment with someone next year instead of the cramped dorms.
Do you trust other people at all?  It seems like it would be hard to trust someone if you think only you can know what is best for you.
Thats great.  It seems like you turned your life around.  It just seems like it would get lonely not being able to trust anyone.
how big is it ?
ah .. well i guess its not that bad yet
Did you think a bear was going to eat you?
Had you forgotten your pepper spray?
oh wow_comma_ this is my passion too_comma_ which EU country are you going to start first?
i have_comma_ and i plan to travel the world in 1-2 years with my wife_comma_ spain is amazing_comma_ you're going to enjoy yourself i wish you the best
well atleast when you finish you can pop a beer and enjoy your hard work
hahaha yeah or go to a nice restaurant to feel relaxed after all that hard work
As reunions go I guess. How was it crazy?
Oh wow_comma_ bet you felt guilty saying no!
Good for you.  We only get one body_comma_ gotta take care of it best we can!
Yeah there's no escaping things that humans have chemically altered_comma_ and we consistently put in our bodies.
lol. Well then darnit I want to be a unicorn.
lol- Well that's true. Darn all those people who stopped me from being a unicorn. Well how on earth did you get back to earth then?
Or unlikely ;)
I am sorry to hear that.  Unfortunately a lot of dog breeds have a high risk of cancer.  Is it treatable?  
Oh my.  I have been in that situation before.  You have my sympathies.  
That sounds terrifying! I wouldn't want to stay alone either. That was nice you guys took her in.
I don't blame her. I am sure she felt more at ease staying with you guys.
that is not good_comma_ why did you miss your son's game?
well if it is work then it is ok because you have to put food on the table first i can relate to that
Did you try to pick her up and take her outside?
You should try and use a toy or something to get her to chase dogs love those.
Why do you say used to be your favorite restueraunt?
Wow.. that really stinks that that happened to your favorite resteraunt 
Oh no! That is horrible! Did you get it back?
That must be so stressful. I am sorry.
That's cool_comma_ was it nostalgic? 
Yeah_comma_ it's crazy to think how long ago some things are
oh no thats horrible.  Im glad i didnt see that_comma_ i wouldve been so upset
yea thats what I was thinking too.  poor doggy :(
what time was it? please becareful with these kinds of things_comma_ you were lucky and i am glad nothing happend_comma_ but people don't realise how dangerous it is at night_comma_ why were you out so late?
please becareful my friend had his phone stolen recently because of the same thing
That sounds wonderful! I bet it was amazing
Wow! I wish I could see something like that
That is very disgusting. I hope you complained!
That is nice. Sometimes things like this do happen_comma_ but it is not something you like to see!
oh im so sorry_comma_ please don't worry_comma_ i know it's tough but i learned that death is only a beginning not the end 
just like birth_comma_ death is the start of another process unclear to us_comma_ the unseen_comma_ and i believe in this deeply_comma_ your mother is fine_comma_ she is always there
aww_comma_ im sorry. thats always hard
I hope you are able to make some new friends.  Or keep in touch with video calls
A road trip sounds fun_comma_ but I agree with you. I feel like I am a cab driver when people are on devices and not talking to me at all.
Yeah can you take turns driving?
Good luck with that_comma_ its rough out there.
I hear ya. Perhaps they will though? gotta stay positive.
That could be embarrassing_comma_ do you have a new partner?
Oh no_comma_ let's hope she's up for some action with another girl.
Did he finish it all? 
What did the shirt look like?
oh god that's worse than thinking you lost your phone for a second_comma_ i am aware of the feeling_comma_ how are you feeling now
what did you learn?
Did you try to find who the $20 belonged to? 
I would feel guilty keeping money that I did not earn or that was not mine. Maybe you could give the $20 to charity?
Dang_comma_ that's a nice honor. Shows you what he thinks of you. I would like someone to ask me to be their best man one day! Congratulations to the both of you
Oh yeah_comma_ I forgot that's one of your responsibilities! Well_comma_ you know your brother best_comma_ so I'm sure you'll know what to do. But if you think he won't like the typical drunken debauchery stripper party_comma_ don't do it just because it's the thing everyone does. When my brother had his wedding_comma_ we just sat around and played video games
Well its good that you are helping out your friend. I'm sure he appreciates it.
It's good that you are making an effort. That's more than a lot of people do. 
oh welcome to the long distance club! i am exactly in the same situation as you_comma_ we are going on a cable car_comma_ we are going to meet in 2 weeks and i also can't wait_comma_ i feel you_comma_ LET'S HAVE  A BLAST
Yup i totally get you_comma_ it's same here and now it feels time is going super slow_comma_ these next 2 weeks are going to be hell before i go to see her_comma_ make sure you enjoy yourself!
What happened?
Oh no! That's sad
why was it amazing?
ah thats cool then
Thats really sad.  Im sorry to hear that.  Getting old stinks.  I feel bad when I see someone who seems really lonely
Yea thats hard.  You cant do anything now_comma_ but maybe theres another neighbor that you can get close too 
That really is something to get excited about! I've never been outside of the country_comma_ so I'm jealous of people that get the chance to. I hope you're able to get everything out of the trip that you want to
If I were you_comma_ I'd be the same way_comma_ just counting down the days. I hope your travel goes smoothly. If you're going with someone special_comma_ I hope you guys both enjoy your time there
That sounds really annoying_comma_ i bet thats making a huge mess
Yea train her to push the stuff into the garbage can
Sorry to hear that. Maybe your luck will turn around soon!
I hope you weren't too jealous of him! I hope you win next time.
Well if he was good at the trick its understandable. As long as you were a kid.
Wow_comma_ you better let someone else do your due diligence you might fall victims to scammers.
Must be disappointing knowing the spark isn't there.
I guess_comma_ as long as you are happy enough.
Im happy to hear that! That is a big step and he needs as much support as possible! 
I bet he feels so good about that_comma_ its amazing to watch a big milestone!
that stinks i'm sorry.
our weather has been so extreme this year. its scary.
That's awesome! What did they do?
That is really cool! You have some really great coworkers!
That's good! Always smart to be prepared!
Yeah_comma_ I always make sure to have things like band-aids or tape with me in case of emergencies.
Good for you_comma_ how did it turn out?
At least you tried_comma_ there are plenty of fish in the sea. Don't give up.
that sucks_comma_ perhaps he should of be saving his money to pay for his apartment_comma_ instead of having two dogs.
Well that was nice of you_comma_ glad you took the dogs in.
That sounds very depressing.
You will for sure be next if it stays like that.
Have you gone to a doctor about it yet?
Well would you rather have it creep up on you out of the blue?
That sucks_comma_ I imagine nothing ever became familiar to you.
Yeah_comma_ a bit like how my employment goes.
oh my goodness. what did you do? are you alright?
i would have pulled into a public place or police station. i'm so sorry that happened to you but glad you are ok.
Do they live far away from you?
wow that is far.  I hope you guys use video chats
uhoh.  I hope it was ok.
ewww thats so gross.  I hope you didnt have to clean it up
that is awesome. stay positive i hope things will work out.
i'm so glad. marriage is tough but when you love each other it's work the effort.
Oh really did you meet them from tinder
Try not to scare them away_comma_ could be your last shot at love.
How did you celebrate after?
What's your favorite alcohol to drink?
That is pretty awesome my dude.
Man that would of been cool but thinking about that was cool.
Did he get soaked?
That's good
That's so cool! I would love to have a car like that!
Yeah_comma_ I feel like we are living in a science fiction movie sometimes!
Thats so nice of them! Did you enjoy it?
I agree_comma_ they must really love you a lot
Well did people  help you get cleaned off.
Hopefully you didn't miss the best part of the fair. That would be unlucky
I love when that happens!  I did the same thing not too long ago when I was in the area I grew up in.  
Yup!  It really makes you appreciate life!
Oh my_comma_ I hope it was only a sincere error and not the charger being malicious
Ugh that must be so aggravating that you can't even get your money back. I would suggest calling and telling the manager.
Oh my_comma_ why on earth did you do that?
As you should_comma_ spitting in food is never the right answer. Hopefully you learned something from this.
Oh really? Did you go check it out?
Yeah I think I would have felt the same!
Why inspired you to do that?
I suppose if any car should be fit for such a task_comma_ it would be a Tesla. 
Sorry to hear that! It must be infuriating to have that happen
Neither would I. Hopefully_comma_ the other person is paying up for the damage at least
that is awesome. where is your "home"?
that is amazing. my mom never really cooked for us but she was a great mom. i bet you miss home.
What are they making you feel like?
Wow_comma_ that seems bad. Why are you taking them?
oh really_comma_ did you prepare it yourself.
well good thing you listened
That must have frightened you.  Was it the beef jerky sasquatch?
What is a potato camera?
Oh my_comma_ how are you going to bathe and use the restroom?
As you should be! I think you need to call another plumber
That's awesome. Do the people you work with know it?
I hope you get a raise soon
That's great! What kind of car?
Good_comma_ my son could be driving_comma_ but he doesn't have a car to drive or the real need to. He likes to walk to places
Oh no ! Did she offer to replace the cost of the plants at least ?
Oh thats quite understandable then ! I try to never let small things overcome a good relationship with friends =)
I am scared of those things too.  Where did you go?
I don't blame you one bit!
Nice! Always good to go on a date and celebrate your love.
Oh! Sorry to hear that! Will you get a divorce now?
Oh man that stink. I bet you will find someone though.
Yeah we've all felt that at some point in life. 
It must be such an exciting time for her and your family!
Get a nice gift for her to let her know how happy you are for them!
Do you think you have pushed your self enough or are you worried? 
Great_comma_ I wish you all the lucky in the world.
Wow you must be pretty old_comma_ did you have indoor plumping 
Well that sounds pretty fun_comma_ It must have been nice to grow up during the 60s
That's aweful! What do they do?
Your boss. How do they take advantage of you?
why did you not get your raise?
that stinks. i know how that feels.
That's awesome. Was it worth it?
I hope you got plenty of photo's?
that is awesome.
i really wish i would be able to do so well in math
What is your goal weight?
I love horses_comma_ what other sports do you play?
Did she appreciate it?
That's amazing_comma_ I would love to have some today.
What was chasing you?
I bet your friends were laughing the whole time!
Why are you angry_comma_ did you sister get unfairly fired?
Sounds like in the long run they will all end up fired if they don't get their money right
Good for you!
That's great. Its good that you have a support network like that. 
Are you always alone?
I can imagine. Why don't you take a lyft or uber?
A walking buddy then? they should be free.
That's great. Is it his first year?
Wow how exciting_comma_ has he been practicing a lot? 
Its definitely not fair. It seems almost as if people do not TRY to create a friendship or are playing both ends of the candle to see which bargain (plans) per friends are better_comma_ and then make a choice
Yes_comma_ true friends understand and will work around your schedule and won't put you off_comma_ or make you feel like you have done something wrong.  
Sorry to hear that. My parents used to struggle with health issues too_comma_ and I'd worry just as much as they would. Do you know when it may be rescheduled for?
It sounds like you're patient and prepared to take it. I wish the best for you guys!
That is good. What are some of your favorites?
Those are really cool traditions.
that's cool. what kind of job did you apply for?
that would be amazing. i hope it works out for you.
That's awesome! Why are you proud of her?
Good for her. It's great that she is pursuing her dreams!
What happened to your grama?
I'm sorry to hear that _comma_were you close?
Why's that?
Sounds pretty tough
That is awful. I hope you are okay!!!
I'm so sorry that happened to you. It must have been so scary.
Well you must be very lucky then.
Things seem to go in cycles_comma_ sometimes you just got to make it through the other side.
Wow_comma_ how fast were you going?
That can happen to anyone though. It was speeding_comma_ but at least it wasn't wreckless driving!
That is awesome. What is your future endeavor comprised of ?
Thats quite the diverse field ! My son changed that major because it has too much Math involved. He graduated with an Infomatics degree
What is he doing?
Can't you report him?
That's no good.
Wow that_comma_s exciting! What are you planning on majoring in?
That's a very interesting field. Are you nervous?
Much luck to you!
What was tempting you?
Yes_comma_ that sounds quite hard!  Good for you for being faithful though!
What went right last?
Wow where are you working? That's amazing.
I do too! Have you had a specific situation lately?
That sucks. You can't really get away from that situation. Maybe look for a new job?
I'm sure you'll be fine if you study enough!
Excellent I hope so
I hate when that happens. It's such a bummer!
I'm sorry. You should go out and enjoy yourself and rub it in their face!
Oh that's really cool. Was it from your childhood?
Well I think it's really good you found such a cool think from your childhood
Thats good wish my brother was like that.
Man that just makes me jealous some.
How likely is he to go ape shit?
You may want to replace that beer. lol
Oh yeah_comma_ I have seen those kind of micro bikes before. Takes some skill I suppose.
Maybe that's all he could spare for. Still got to stunt whenever possible. 
Yep I like them too. Especially Frozen.
Oh yea_comma_ that movie was one of my favorites when I was a child
I love cats_comma_ did you punish her?
What is her name?
Oh that's awesome. Finally ready for the baby? 
I see. That's a long time. I wish you the best of luck this time!
that is so stinking awesome
it will be an adrenaline rush for sure
Are you not able to make ends meet right now?
That's a good attitude to have!  Stay strong!
I would never be able to do that!
Stay on the ground my friend.
That's great! What do you have planned?
That does sound like a lot of fun!
That had to be a weird feeling.  How was it?
I can imagine.  Ive never been back to mine_comma_ but i can still picture in my mind what it looks like
Uh oh! I would hate that 
That's always got to be the worst thing to deal with
Oh yeah? What is the exam for? I hope you do well.
Oh man I always found calculus to be really tough. I'm glad you seem confident. 
Thats awesome.  Make sure you wear sunscreen.  Dont want to get burned
I need some time off of work too.  Maybe I should take a vacation!
Uh oh. A little too much to drink?
That is about as bad as it can get right there. I think you might have to tell her. The guilt will eat you alive.
Wow he must have been hungry as hell.
oh it was one of those chalenges things?
how are you doing now ?
yea thats good though that you are moving forward
Damn was it a bogus call or what
Well I hope you'll have a better ref next time...just keep hustling
I agree_comma_ they think they're so smart but they are not!
Exactly you got it_comma_ they will make their mistakes.
I know the feeling.  I wish i could go back to being little again
yea and I didnt have to go to work!
What was the bad thing about it?
Man that does sound scary! I hope that it didn't follow you home!
That's great! He sounds like a good addition in your life.
Awe I love my dog too_comma_ she's really sweet. Well except my dog doesn't listen_comma_ so I guess your dog beats mine_comma_ lol.
Are you jealous of them?
That sucks_comma_ i just had a massive meal myself.
Hopefully you do well with it!
You will get in and do great things!
ohno_comma_ what did you have? what was bad about it?
ewww that sounds disgusting.  I would have complained
That was really nice of you. Did you find it?
Well keep looking and maybe check the local animal shelters if you haven't already.
That's pretty compassionate of you!
Do you have any pets of your own? you sound like an animal person
Good times indeed!  Those were the days.  It seems cliche to say they were simpler times because I remember them saying that back then about when they were younger.  History repeats itself.
When I think of Christmas with families I tend to think about National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.  A classic.
how come? is everything alright?
that would be great. i'm hoping all goes well with you.
I hope everything goes well! What are you worried about?
Well I hope that it is nothing serious. 
That's great! 
I hope he does!
Wow. I wish something like that would happen to me. That is so cool.
Maybe you can pay it forward next time you see someone buying a drink.
Why was that?
Are you sure they were werewolves and not regular wolves?
when is the beat down scheduled for and how can i help?
no no_comma_ we need revenge. think about it and let me know
I think that way too!
If you expect the worst_comma_ you won't be disappointed. 
Hate when that happens...if it happens more than once you can file a complaint with the city council
Or next time stand in the garbageman's way at your neighbor's to confront him about it haha
who? is everything alright?
oh my goodness i'm so sorry. i really hope she comes back soon
Do you have a plan made up?
I think you can do this_comma_ I'm proud of you.
Whats your first step in the plan to get back on track?
I love Nintendo_comma_ I use to play every time.
What game did you play?
I know. The news said it was 100% but nothing so far.
It cool things off a little bit too. We could use it.
were you in bed with your roommate ?
oh yuk. next time threesome! goodluck
That is impressive! Where they ok afterwards?
That's what they get for eating that much food!
I'm sure you did great! I hate public speeking.
I bet! Well it over now and I'm sure you did great!
Is the friend a female?
Should you be worried?
Oh shoot! That's never fun. Did you get a ticket?
That was very lucky!
Dammmnn is your cat ok??
That is f***king ridiculous I would've chased that car down and beat the living s**t out of the driver
You sound like you'd be a good therapist.
It's been to be humble than rude or mean_comma_ that's my motto.
That's great that you had such a good time. You sound like a good parent!
That really is. When I comes down to it what a kid wants most from a parent is love. 
Oh no! Why are you worried about that?
Well it is good that you are prepared. It is always important to have extra supplies in case of an emergency. 
Whoa!  I saw his initial performance and was blown away!  That must have been amazing to see!
That is good news!  I'm sure you will look forward to it as will I
Oh no!  I remember doing something similar when I was younger.  There was a pool outside of our screen door.  I went to run and jump into the pool from in the house and smashed right through it!
Gotta roll with it!  Just play it off at that point.
know it all people drive me nuts too
people need to learn and be humble honeslty
Are you a college student? Or just living far away from them
Wow that's pretty far...do you call/facetime them during the week?
Oh no_comma_ that sucks man. I hope you didn't miss out on too much when you had to go into work.
Oh well that is convenient_comma_ good thing that they didn't remember that it was the day that you had requested off. Lol.
How did that happen? I am so sorry.
Well at least it sounds like you lost some weight. Dont let it get to you that much though.
what is the job for?
oh wow_comma_ well best of luck!
why is that?
good_comma_ any plans of leaving?
Hey me too! What are you looking forward to the most about it!
Yeah it's going to be great!
why is that?
that is great reason!
oh yea its out in december right ?
its gonna be epic 
Oh no_comma_ I've never had a cat because my husband and brother are allergic. Is she trying to mark her terriorty?
I bet! Maybe get her checked and see if she has a UTI or if its just behavioral.  Ask on your local pet page if its normal for cats.
why is that?
oh_comma_ well just talk louder!
I'm more of a dallas fan myself.
We will for sure win this year!
It sure is.  It is an important step in this road we call life.
And now he can focus on the next phase of his life.  Which should be exciting
why did it go off?
oh_comma_ well you live and you learn
That is a strange scenario. Do you live in chicago.
Oh wow_comma_ yeah that is a pretty terrible place. Your should get out.
Nice. What was his first day?
How it went for hime? Did he cry?
I would be so frustrated.  Do you have any way to make him do the necessary fixes?
I don't blame you!  It might cost more to sue than to break the lease and move.
I am happy for you.
I wish you the most success.
That sounds really good! I'm kind of jealous1
What kind of cheesecake are you thinking of eating?
Oh no. Whats wrong? Why are you going?
I'm sorry I hope it nothing serious. I hope it just seems bad but is easily fixable. 
I know exactly how you feel. Sometimes it is for the best if they are suffering though.
Oh definitely. I can say that it does get better with time. 
wow_comma_ that is awesome_comma_ go you!
well sometimes luck is in your favor!
That is exciting! You'll have some free mommy time or be able to go to work while they are in school. 
Defenitly! Plus the first few week of school can be hectic_comma_ it'll be nice to have that downtime after you drop them off.
Where were you when you noticed that is broke? Maybe it's possible to find it!
I'm sure you feel terrible about it. I hope you can find a replacement for it or have it fixed!
oh that sucks .. celebrate during the weekend
there is always next year!
How did it go?
oh_comma_ I am sorry to hear that...
MY little cousins are too. They love that game
I have watched them before but never played.
why is that?
that is not in your control!

Yeah me to. It's going to be so great!
I think the new characters will be really cool to play with. 
Thats pretty cool...what's the number one thing you're most grateful for
That's great_comma_ I'm thankful for my self-employed status and all the money I'm making for my future family.  Wish y'all the best
i can totally relate. i'm currently on a medication that has me feeling mentally_comma_ emotionally_comma_ and physically ill
i'm switching to my new pill tomorrow and i'm hoping that i will have better results
I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ I have two dogs and know how they become part of the family.
I know_comma_ it's defenitly painful to have to go through but its part of life. Maybe get a new puppy to start loving/sharing life with_comma_ shelters have so many dogs that need homes!
Oh okay_comma_ sorry about not getting off for work. I hope the new pizza place is good at least. 
Uhhhhh..... you okay man? I advise against arson.
Wouldnt that be something... I suppose you're a massive fan of them
That is some dedication_comma_ will you go to watch it live in the stadium?
why did you do that?
i would be too
That is very annoying. Did you talk to them?
Did you try to talk to your landlord?
That's terible. Did you call the police? There has to be consequences
It still could and it could be worse. I hope not for your sake
Aww thats great! Sounds like you two are a power couple!
Sounds like you two are the perfect match_comma_ cherish your marriage.
I agree_comma_ its one of best smallest things in life that make it worth it
Yup_comma_ I make it a point to have dinner with a friend every now and then
Oh that dont sound really good
I think you make a wise decision_comma_ never drink too much again
you better be cause im coming for it
you wanna put some cash on it or what
Oh that's too bad. Maybe you could have someone walk with you?
Whatever makes you feel safe!
I bet you'll have a little extra power now
That's awesome!  You should get back to work and kick some butt :)
Why weird
Oh haha well that'll be interesting...at least the kids will feel good that they were braver than Mommy hahaha
Ah I am an eagles fan_comma_ but we finally got you this year
that is funny_comma_ you gotta be aware when in the presence of greatness
Good.  It's important that we all feel satsified with our situations.
Well I hope nothing changes_comma_ and you stay happy forever!
I've never been into pokemon but my brother is a big fan. When does the game come out?
Thanks! Maybe I will get it for his birthday in November. I will have to look into it.
You should use it as fuel and keep going.
Then you need something to motivate you. Try watching the Rocky II
Are you leaving on a jet plane?  I am guessing you are going on vacation?
Nice.  I love Florida.  What part of the state are you going to?
You could have gone to a bar and found some friends 
That's what the alcohol is for lol
Oh wow I hope you are save did you have to evacuate to a shelter or to family house away?
Glad you and your family is safe and let's just hope the storm passes by and cause no damage to home town.
Did it tear up your car?
The guy didnt even stop did he?
Aw_comma_ I bet she makes your life so much more happier. 
You must have taught her to be very well behaved
Oh shucks that's bad!  Did you call in sick?
oh haha.  Awesome!  Now what are you gonna do?
what are you gonna do 
oh that sounds nice
Oh no_comma_ were you able to get into you work ?
I'm sure you will not be the first or the last to lose one of those.  My husband has lost his a few times as well.  Hopefully it's a simple process to get a new one made.
Oh_comma_ I'm sure that's a bit boring have you had fun stuff to do?
I'm sorry to hear that. If your neighborhood is rough take precautions_comma_ otherwise maybe try to find a tea or something to help sooth.
Lucky! I love when that happens! 
Yum_comma_ sounds like a good use of the money! Hopefully you find some more spare money haha
I imagine that was a pleasure that was simple at one time_comma_ but one you really appreciated when you came back. Thanks for your service!
Absolutely! It can often take really significant events to happen before we realize it too. 
Oh no_comma_ what happened?
That sucks_comma_ I hope you found your dog.
What a bummer. Landlords suck for the most part. 
Do you have a lease?
I understand. Me too_comma_ I don't like people talking too much.
Are you still seeing him?
Did he give her a haircut?
How long did you live her with him for?
Oh no. Did the waitress realize it before you left?
I see. Well if you go there again_comma_ be sure to leave her a bigger one!
ewwww did you eat it??
haha I bet.  Did it smell too?
Should have fed it to the birds!!
haha hopefully not :D
Oh yeah? What kind of restaurant? 
Oh cool_comma_ I hope it ends up being nice and tasty.
Oh wow that sounds scary_comma_ I hope your alright? 
Thats great_comma_ glad someone you knew passed by. Hope its not going to be expensive to fix.
I'm very glad you can rely on yourself!  I def trust you already.
I'll email you right away_comma_ keep a look out for that :-)
That is pretty exciting :) do you have kids of your own
Nice looks like you're gonna be racking up some babysitting hours..lol hope you're ready 
Nicde
No_comma_ I never had.
Man that's pretty gross
I would switch computers...or ask him if he's found gold yet
That was really nice. I hope you had a good dinner.
Sounds like you have a really nice brother. You are very lucky!
That's interesting_comma_ I haven't seen a good magic show in a while.
Very cool_comma_ I hope more people continue to recognize his talent and he gets the acclaim he deserves.
Sounds like a great lady.  I am glad you are appreciative of her 
Yes it is.  You should take her out to dinner or something to say thank you.
Happy birthday! Did you have fun?
That sounds like a lot of fun. You have some pretty great coworkers!
I know how that is. What happened?
That is so sad. I have dealt with something similar. Good luck!
Ive been there. It gets old real quick.
Just try and keep a low profile and stay busy. 
How did she get them if they were sold out?
Wow thats awsome man. Who are you seeing?
That sounds horrible_comma_ and scary
What did you do after
Aw_comma_ I hate it when that happens_comma_ but I bet the relative understands.  Sometimes things come up.
They've probably been on the other side of this situation before.
Sounds fun!  Where ya headed to?
Oh cool.  Sounds like fun!  Be safe!
Are you excited for them
That sounds like a good year to me
That's awesome! What are you going to study?
That's really cool! Good luck!
That's awful I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ what are you planning on doing?
Definitely_comma_ I'd look to move on if I was you.
I love me some pumpkin pie_comma_ whats she going through?
I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ I love animals. I hope she cheers up.
Are you nervous about which schools you might get accepted for_comma_ or do you feel good about it?
Oh wow_comma_ yeah you should have no problem! I did just fine with way worse than that.
I bet_comma_ that is a great achievment! Loosing weight is hard! Keeping it off is even harder. 
You can do it! Keep up the hard work :)
You sound inspirational my friend.
Where are you living your dream out at?
Sry to hear that....what happened
Hey well I bet you're talented at other things...just stack your paper and you'll have the last laugh
Did your boss tell you why?
Oh so it was a positive thing...that's great_comma_ well I hope you enjoy your mini vacation :)
Um_comma_ you seem really upbeat and happy!
Are you really excited about somthing going on in your life?
That sucks so much. I hope there isn't any tension between you and your friend.
I hope you can both work it out_comma_ it would be awful for a friendship to end over something like that.
What happened to him
That sounds very painful. I am sure they were glad you came with them
That is very good news. It means that you are doing a great job.
What are you planning to do with the money?
I love Halloween_comma_ what is horrors night?
That's fun_comma_ do the ghosts chase you around?
Ah you aren't a big fan of tomatos?
Yes_comma_ if you requested no tomato_comma_ you should get a refund!
What does that even mean?
Interesting_comma_ what caused you to do that?
What's your favorite kind of cake flavor
Ice ice baby widen your horizons maybe can't identify with the girl or guy who shy's away from chocolate cake b***h u craayy
What was it?
Yeah and I understand. It's not for everybody!
lol why?
lol.  Do you think there are monsters down there?
You should turn the lights on!
Did you call him to complain about that?
That's awful_comma_ my air conditioner is cleaned thankfully. 
I'm right there with you!  That is the best thing in the world! Are you there now?  I'm talking to my husband about moving to the beach permanently.
I'm so jealous!  I haven't been in years now!  Breathe in the salt air for me!
You must be a savior to him_comma_ is he paying you for that?
Very true_comma_ I hope he knows how lucky he is.
Have you been working hard in the off season?
You sound very confident. Sounds like you put in the work. Good luck.
That is great how do you think you did?
Congratulations that is so awesome to have passed such a intense exam.
Uh oh! Are they picky?
That's not cheap at all! 
Are you gonna complain to someone about it?
I am sorry to hear that then...
I understand. I had the same feeling. When did she passed away?
How old was she when she passed away?
good stuff_comma_ you picked a good time to do it!
wow that is pretty soon_comma_ it snuck up on me
Me too!  I used to be able to watch some when I was younger but then I realized I was torturing myself because I hate them!
I agree.  They literally haunt you forever.
Why is that?
oh_comma_ that makes sense. why yesterday then?
Oh I am sorry to hear that. You must have been close to her.
Yes_comma_ at least you have those memories of her to cherish and hold forever.
I get that_comma_ but money talks at the end of the day
That is what it comes down to sometimes!
That is always tough to deal with.  Time can help_comma_ but it can't get you over the loss of a loved one.
I agree.  Things can always get better_comma_ just remember her and honor her the best that you can.
I can imagine so! I bet you are one tired person when you hit the bed at night!
I hope you do! I really wish you the best.
I bet that will be fun. Do you do that a lot
I need to game more when I can
Well with what?
Well best of luck!
That's awesome!   What does she do?
That's amazing!  What a commendable job!  Good for her!
What happened?
Wow I love nintendo_comma_ you should get an NES classic!
I am so sorry to hear it! 
Hopefully you can go back and get it! 
That sounds like a lot of fun! What were some of your favorite games to play?
That is really cool. It's nice that you could rediscover a bit of your childhood. 
Thats great news. Where you expecting it?
Well that is great. Sounds like you really deserved it.
That's a rip off at that price.
Did you ever try netflix? It's great.
Thats too bad
wow. thats kind of cruel
What is that game about
That sounds really fun_comma_ I am sure it will be good
that is good_comma_ it has been hot here recently
that is good_comma_ cherish that stuff while it lasts!
That is very nice to have someone providing support
Good. It is important to be open about all subject. Is she accepting it?
Did you tell him about it or no?
You should tell him he will like you for it.
Aww dangit!  Maybe he'll let you drive it
And then just keep driving and don't take it back lol
How did that make you feel
I have been there. It is nice to have those memories
i get that_comma_ I have one coming up as well
just stay calm and collected_comma_ talk slowly_comma_ gather your thought
That is so awesome. I hope you show them how grateful you are.
Well I am sure you deserve it. Just take real good care of it.
That is great you should follow up with them in a few days.
I was going to ask if it was for a manager that is awesome you got this they will be hiring you on the spot.
I have.  It was a long time ago.  I had a lot of fun watching it with my daughter but I always feel sad for the animals_comma_ until I found out that the circus I went to helps injured animals have a home.
Yes!  I'm very much against animal cruelty but not every circus is bad thankfully.  Do you love the circus?
Did you see the person that got shot when it happened?
Where do you live?
Oh no! Are they just scared?
I'm so happy for her! Hopefully everything goes well for her
Oh no_comma_ I'm sorry man. Hopefully next time. Were you at least able to reach out and see what you could improve upon? 
I bet that is pretty disappointing. Maybe some ice cream will make you feel better.
You are saying it as if it's a bad thing_comma_ are you left without friends?
My friend just stay strong_comma_ family and kids can suck you life away(not always of course).
I guess you got an A?
Well done_comma_ what other exams are left?
Where have you been traveling
Oh that sounds very exotic
Maybe you can catch up on some sleep?
I know it will feel lonely but a good weekend to recharge will do some good.
Are yall gonna go on a date?
what is the dinner?
Yum!!!!! I literally just watched a recipe on how to make a vegan chocolate cake so I'm craving one!  With tons of icing!
Yum! Have a piece for me!!
Yeah that must have been a trip down memory lane.
Well you are one of the lucky ones then
I bet he would be proud
It will always be a nice reminder then
You got some good new? 
I cant think of better way to have fun with friends. Sounds like a great time.
Why?
I understand. He need to rest and take a nap.
You should. Thats not nice
well i hope you learned your lesson
Health is truly a blessing! How old are your children? 
I agree. I can't imagine what it must be like to be a parent and go through that. 
Eww! I really hate olives also. What things do you like in your salad?
I'm just a plain salad person_comma_ but I do like my bacon bits and croutons in a salad. Also some carrots.
That is very tense to be waiting on that kind of call you got this positive thoughts only. What position is it for?
Just be patient you aced it and you will get that position and call soon. 
Ohhhh sophomore year can be tough. How do you feel about that?
Wow. He's taking on quite a lot_comma_ but it'll be good for building his character as he gets older!
Oh that's awesome!   Congrats!!
I hope it's a baby!!!! Good luck!
Oh wow_comma_ how were you doing that? 
I'm sorry you feel bad about it now. I'm not really sure what I can say_comma_ it's not like you can change the past. You could try volunteering. 
Why so interestin?
I know the feeling. Do you huys get to talk?
Why was it not a good day? What happened?
Oh_comma_ I'm so sorry to hear that.  My father in law had to have hospice and although it's not what you want to hear_comma_ the people that work with hospice are really a lifeline for the family.
That sounds like a lot of fun I have never been to one before.
I may to check one out. I like trying out new places.
What kind of test is it
I hope you do well
oh yea what is the meeting about ?
oh that sounds interesting_comma_ good luck
I have seen them eat bigger
Why that response?
Why are you nervous?
Yes_comma_ the lines are a pain.
What was the news?
That's so tragic_comma_ did the doctor say what happened?
Have you been studying for it?  I hope you do well.
Then hopefully you will do really well on it.  It's normal to be a bit apprehensive before a big test though.
Really_comma_ where is that?
Well at least you are not in the middle of the flight.
Very wise of you_comma_ experiences are all that matters.
I see_comma_ but you do realize that happiness for the most part is immaterial_comma_ right?
Do you feel guilty now?
How are you going to make up for it?
What a nice surprise. What was the card for?
What is limiting your ability to visit?
Are you happy for him?
Don't be_comma_ it's a destructive emotion. 
Isn't it grand_comma_ I bet we no very little authentic information about them.
I bet they are much older than we believe them to be.
I would be sad about that! I'm so sorry
Did you finally get it working ?
Is doctor pepper your favorite?
That's awful_comma_ sorry to hear that. I love me some Sprite.
Thats interesting
Thats awesome. How was the first day for him?
oh wow_comma_ i wish i could go there_comma_ do you plan to return one day ?
that is something i hope to do one day as well. good luck
That's the best way to go in to an interview. How do you think it went?
Oh congratulations! What kind of job? 
I am so sorry. It happens to everyone and no one is ever prepared for it
Thats the only bad thing about having animals_comma_ you are going to outlive them
Is you cat ok now? What do you think it is?
Most likely. They can be skittish little things.
That's awesome!  Congrats!!
Wow!  That's a long hard battle!  Poor little kitty
Which amusement park?
Roller coasters are fun but you should stay safe too.
What other rides should you take?
That's one thing I don't miss is having someone stay above me did they dog make lot's of noise?
That is so rude and disgusting I know you was a tad bit furious. 
That would make me SO angry. What kind of drugs is it? I would make sure the police took him out.
Well I have the same issue..they aren't afraid..they're just corrupt..but I just yell at those people myself. I don't put up with the ghetto corrupt crap
Is he a pervert?
Did you call the police?
That's great!  Did she move recently?  Do you miss her?
I'm sorry.  That can be so tough when you're used to her being so close.  Did she move far away?
wow. Where are you going?
omg. that is going to  be so nice
It is good to have someone that can provide support. Do you have a depression?
It is very nice from her.
Are you disappointed with it?
I feel like you should take it up with him.
I cant imagine how much that hurts.. I would be so sad.
It always hurts more when its unexpected. Hopefully time heals.
Where are you vacationing too?
I love the heat_comma_ you're going to be melting up in Florida though.
I can only do about 5 don't feel bad do you try them often? 
If you practice everyday you will get better I was the same way.
I love seafood! What kind of seafood dishes? 
Awesome! Cooking can be pretty hard and it's an essential skill to have.
what is bugging you today
you didnt get an invite ?
Oh_comma_ did you have plans after work?
So sorry you had to miss it_comma_ maybe take him out to ice cream to console him
That's fantastic. It always feels good inside when you make a good impression. 
That would be so nice for you. I really hope it works out. 
Cool_comma_ what's truffle oil got to do with mac and cheese?
Oh okay_comma_ that sounds good
Oh yeah me too! Even though it makes me a little nervous to think about it.
That's a good idea. I'd feel better doing it that way_comma_ at least the first time.
That's great_comma_ your hardwork totally payed off
Stay positive and keep up the good work!
That sounds like fun! Which amusement park?
In that case_comma_ more terrifying than fun. I hope you find rides you'll enjoy and not fear!
Oh thats's nice
Mine too. I love the trees in fall
What did she or he do lately?
Do you plan on arguing to him about it?
oh no. what happened?
I didn't even know that was a thing. Im sorry
uh I've heard way too many people experience that. Why don't people just not hit you in the first place_comma_ if they don't want to take responsibility?
I really wish those people who get fined just like those traffic cameras that send you tickets in the mail for speeding. It would really reduce hit and runs.
Wow I wish I could make a change like that!
Long time but I'm sure very beneficial
what kind of cake cake cake?
oh you try baking it with the cherries on already ? its great
That's great! Where ya headed?
That sounds like a lot of fun! Who ya going with?
Very nice! I bet your more than excited about it!
Oh no! Dont be anxious or worried! I'm sure you did good on the application. 
Have more confidence in yourself! Take pride in your work! 
what did you try?
yea it looks gross
Oh that sounds delicious!  I bet you could do it!
Did that guy finish it?  Did he get an award of any kind? 
That's rude. Do it they do that often?
You should definitely talk to them about that.
I love fried rice
Oh. I am the same with lemon icebox pies and my grandmother
It is very nice from him. Until what time did you work?
It should very hard to work that late.
Oh no_comma_ how come?
It happens sometime. Just try not to forget next time.
Eek! Sounds pretty scary! I hate to be alone at night. 
Yeah pretty creepy. Turn on some music or something so you don't get too nervous or anxious. 
Headaches really suck_comma_ I'm so sorry to hear that. Any idea why you've been getting bad ones?
It could be. Also may be related to dehydration_comma_ and eye strain related to visual problems. Try and drink more water and have your eyes checked to be sure!
That sounds exciting_comma_ what kind of restaurant is it?
OO that sounds snazzy!  Perhaps that will also mean bigger tips!  I hope you do amazing on your interview with them.
She must be so excited! How long will you guys be there for?
Wow. That's a lot of places. Sounds fun!
I'm sorry to hear that. What's got you feeling so tired?
Being a parent really is a thankless job_comma_ until your kids get older and realize how tough it is.
Wow_comma_ your dog is that cat's hero!
I bet your dog is pretty smart. I mean she was able to notice a cat in danger and helped out and all.
I don't understand why people just don't break up. Why cheat?
People are just so inconsiderate sometimes. Even if you don't love the person anymore_comma_ at least treat them like someone you used to love.
Oh no! Im sorry. Im sure your excited now!
Oh no! IM glad your no longer feeling hungry. I bet your content with it now
Oh man! That would scare the heck out of me 
Would that even change anything?
i only do that at the seafood buffet.
I used to work at a buffet lol. You're not the only person who over ate at a buffet before
That sounds delicious_comma_ do you know how to make it now?
You sound like a great parent. you should pass down the recipe to your kids too
Wow_comma_ why stay with him for so long if she was going to say no?
Yeah man_comma_ that sucks
Tell him he owes you one now. Can't just be taking people's ice cream.
Oh man_comma_ now I want some ice cream.
Oh.  What happened?
Oh that's amazing!!! What did you name her?
What happened there?
She won't remember that for much longer.
I would be too_comma_ does she live in a bad neighbourhood?
That's smart_comma_ you sound like a good sibling to her
It will happen eventually. Enjoy being single while you can.
It will come to you when you least expect it! Until then enjoy yourself!
Oh no_comma_ people are so reckless.
I hope it isn't too expensive to have repaired.
Yea? How'd it go?
That's amazing! Congratulations!
Do you feel more lonely?
You should consider getting some new roomies.
I assume that this job turned out to be the complete opposite of what you expected?
I'm so happy to hear that! Often_comma_ many people find themselves stuck at jobs they hate and it isn't healthy.
How long have you had your cat? Mine used to be like that.
ah a little old lady. Has she always ignored you?
Oh does she feel weird about that? Where does she work?
Yeah_comma_ hopefully they will hire more women soon
Oh no.  Did something happen?
Yikes!!  I bet that was scary!
oh cool_comma_ did it get the job done ?
ah that stinks
Reeboks? Save your jealousy lol
I have like 20 pairs of converse lol. I love them
Where are you meeting her?
You should try to get on tinder.
I wish I could be broke doing something as cute. Seriously that's awesome in a way.
I know how you feel. There's a rabbit that lives under my shed_comma_ and I try and feed it. 
That makes two of us! Big old baby dogs are the cutest though.
Ah pets. What could we do without them?
Yeah_comma_ and it's not too far away from halloween now
I went to one and I kicked a ghost because it tried to grab me haha
Did you discipline him?
Awe is it too warm out? Keep him inside more.
What happended?
Did you not like the person?
What is she doing to boys?
Wow that's no good at all_comma_ do you have any idea how to fix it?
How do you think you did?
That's awesome. When will you get your results?
Have you started?
Man. I should start_comma_ too.
That is a good friend_comma_ but I'm sorry you tore your pants.  Why were you climbing a fence?
Well_comma_ at least your friend was there to help you out.  Maybe you should have picked up a sewing kit at the grocery store to try to fix the jeans also - LOL!
What do you plan on doing while you're alone?
You are an inspiration to me. I need to hit the gym.
Oh no. What happened?
lol is he younger or older?
Ouch that's awful!  Did you get it back yet?
Sheesh.  How much was it?
That's bad I'm sorry :(
Are you switching jobs? Does the new one offer more money?
Ahh_comma_ maybe you can ask your boss for a raise instead? Haha
Oh did you? What happened?!
uh oh when was the last time you checked your weight before this?
That's awesome. You must have trained really hard.
That's great dedication! I just know it will go well!
Nice! I bet your excited about it. I love trying new places. 
Yes it is! Thats sounds disappointing_comma_ but Im glad you found a new place you will hopefully like. 
Yikes_comma_ maybe it's time to switch banks
Oof_comma_ are they even allowed to do something like that?
That is bad. You should have immediately gotten a towel and dry yourself. You could get sick
Did you spend the whole day with wet clothes at work? Didn't the manager allow you to go home and change?
I hope you studied for it!
That's great! I hope you do well on your exam! Reward yourself after too
Well_comma_ I think that all depends on where you're eating and how much you eat. Do you think you're eating anywhere unhealthy?
Mine too. Whenever I go_comma_ I tend to get 10 happy meals. Gotta get all those toys!
Oh god. Did anyting get stuck on your car?
Wow. Would have drove that car straight through the car wash.
Nice! Where are you going to go? 
That sounds like a very romantic destination. I wish you the best of luck.
Oh no! Whats taking you so long. Are you having sentimental moments?
I know it can be upsetting and emotional_comma_ but Im sure you are happy!
haha that's awesome!  Congrats to him!
LOL they sure do!  Do they have any babies yet?
Oh yea? Where ya headed?
The beach is awesome. Have fun!
What things are you wanting to go as planned?
Very true_comma_ I am sure those instructions are forth coming.  He wouldn't leave us hanging.
I can't even imagine what would make them ban certain dogs to begin with
I've heard that fear makes people do all sorts of crazy things.
I admire people who can care for dogs_comma_ i can barely take care of myself!
I was only 18 when my daughter was born_comma_ had no idea what i was  getting into!!!
Does he get anything else?
Oooh_comma_ that doesn't sound great_comma_ but at least he's not causing any trouble. It's hot outside_comma_ everyone needs some clean water
Hmm..I think we've all been there one time or another.  Are you going to admit it?
Well you certainly don't want that hanging over your head for the rest of your life.  It sounds like you have a good moral outlook on life_comma_ I think you have to admit it.
Oh no! Why did you cancel? That's the best time to go!
That's a really good reason to do so. Wouldn't want his mom getting any sicker with no one around.
You should go for it! How long have you known her?
that's cute_comma_ you guys will be very happy together I think
You should totally go!
If there's a time to treat yourself_comma_ it's definitely on your birthday!
Im so sorry! I bet your very sad right now!
Im sorry to hear this. Times like this can be terrifying_comma_ but you can get through it. 
Why did you decide to tell your mom you washed it?
That's okay_comma_ sometimes little white lies like that won't harm anyone!
Oh my god_comma_ that's so sad to hear. How is he holding up?
Aw_comma_ cheer up_comma_ friend. It's rough now_comma_ but it will get better! Maybe you two should go to the pet store to try and find a new dog for him!
Me either_comma_ so rude! It happens too often. 
Yeah people who do that have zero self awareness. :/ 
That's so great! You guys have been able to stay close after so long! You must be very compatible with each other
Amazing! I wish I had some friends like that in my life
Are you excited?
I know what you mean!  I've been homeschooling my girls forever it seems and my oldest graduates this spring.  I'm ready to be done with school too - LOL!
Oh no. How long will he be away for?
Maybe you can get him on Skype or something?
Oh no! Did you look in the places you've been all day?
That's so sad. I hope your spouse won't be too upset with you.
Do you pull it up?
That wouldn't be good.
Were you in a tight spot? How much did you borrow?
What a good friend to lend you money in your time of need. You should thank him and take him to dinner after everything is sorted.
Did you perform well?
Don't worry. You'll get good score.
OH man! I bet you were overwhelmed! did you stay faithful to her?
Thats good! I would of been anxious to get out of that place if that happend. 
Oh no! Why are you nervous?
What topics will the exam be covering?
I hope so too! Do you know if he is planning on proposing anytime soon?
Bah_comma_ he should just do it already! In the wise words of the late Rhiana: "If you like it you should put a ring on it".
How come? Were you scared of the dark?
Oh no! Did your parents check your closet before tucking you into bed?
Oh no! I know car problems can be frusterating. 
I hear ya. Stay hopefull. It will come soon with dertermination. 
I agree. Im sure you will find something. I get anxious for new things as well. 
Awesome!  Cute kitties!  Did you feed them
Yeah.  you can always take them to the shelter or post on FB if someone wants to adopt them!
Wow. That's pretty amazing. So many people break up so easily.
She's a lucky gal!
These people are becoming so pathetic and out of touch with reality that logic and reasoning are becoming an aliens to them
People at CNN and the whole liberal media who ignore the reality of the people's lives and try to project their own moral wonderland onto them
You will do fine_comma_ just relax.
Then be as prepared as you can.
Why do you feel bad?
Oh. I'm sure she didn't mind it. Dogs seem to be a lot less sensitive than people. 
Very good! I bet your anticipating a good turn out!
Well you prepared really well. I feel you will do well on this test!
Where did you lie? I'm on a new diet that I'm really happy with
Yeah I know_comma_ it's time for us to get healthy!
I love Canada_comma_ do you speak French?
Where did you grow up?
That is a miracle.
I hope you make sure the dog is on a leash from now on.
It will be here before you know it.  Are you a big Georgia fan?
Wow_comma_ that is exciting.  The first game of the season is always the best one. 
oh congratulations to your friend!
I wish them the best! Have fun at the wedding!
Ooh_comma_ where are they going?
Wow_comma_ I have a friend that went there for school too!
Being nervous is totally understandable. They chose you_comma_ so they definitely think you can do it!
Hey_comma_ you'll be going up that ladder and will be looking back at how much you've accomplished one day.
Oh no! Have you gone up to check if there's a leak? 
Oh gosh yeah be careful...I hope it stops raining soon :( 
That sounds scary! Has your place been broken into?
What did they take from you?
Oh no_comma_ I hope you find him.
He's probably just gone on holiday_comma_ I'm sure he will come back with gifts.
What was the prize?
Did you keep the pen or sell it?
Oh no_comma_ Did you lose it?
That's good. Glad ya got it back!
It's good. Do you prepare him that ?
It's lovely. What's her name?
I am so sorry to hear that. Do you have a job? Where do you work that you could not make even a rent payment?
So where are you spending your nights? Are there any homeless shelters provided by the social services?
Nice_comma_ you must look like The Hulk.
I run every day.
It'll take some getting used to. Keep at it!
Are you a hockey fan?
That's great! I also have a cat_comma_ she's so precious
A couple years_comma_ she's a persian mix
Oh no you should buy her a new one!
I'm sorry :(   I bet she got upset
Then why are you excite about it?
Why do you say that?
Oh I didn't know that was really happening.
So does that mean she isn't chubby now? Or still chubby but grew into it?
That's good to hear. So did you match with her on tindr or something?
Nice! Is it a fancy One?
Very nice! Were you excited to drive it?
I'm sorry to hear that.  You should have some friends over.  Throw a party and catch up on old times.
Yeah_comma_ it's always good to hang out with friends.  That cheers me up when I'm down.
That is awesome_comma_ was he scared of you?
That is awesome_comma_ was he scared of you?
me too_comma_ I'm long overdue to go to the dentist
ugh_comma_ I know_comma_ I just keep putting it off_comma_ nasty root canal
No. What is it?
What is it about
Why did you guys get divorced?
Well_comma_ then it seems like it was a good choice.  Next time around you will know more what to look for before getting married.  I hope you find someone that matches up better with you.
Did you like living with your Dad?
That was very kind of her.
oh no! I bet your so sad right now. im sorry for your loss
I know it can be upsetting and sad_comma_ but take your time. It will be ok. 
That's awful_comma_ I'm sorry. Does she want to be with the other guy instead of you?
I hope it all works out with you and your girlfriend.
Nice movie! I bet you had a fun and joyful time watching it. 
Nice! How exciting. 
Hey me too!  What are you working on?
No_comma_ I meant I hope you get the funding.  Sounds interesting!!
What?
Yikes! Y'all need another new printer 
That can be tough. I hope everything is okay.
Good luck with it all.
Oh no!  I'm so sorry_comma_ we just went through that with our pup.  It's a hard choice to have to make.
I'm sorry you are having to make that choice_comma_ but I feel it's our duty to them to help them pass on when they are not going to get better and help them not suffer any longer.
Me too. 
Once_comma_ but it burned the wall so my mom got rid of it
That's so sad. What do you think about that?
It might be best to send him then. On the bright side_comma_ you will still be able to visit him and I am sure he'll be taken care of very well.
I agree. Its frusterating_comma_ especially when it was an important conversation. 
How annoying. Dont pay them now mind! do your own thing
Yum! I have never had it. I bet you enjoyed it!
Maybe I should try it out! It will be exciting to do so. 
Oh yeah_comma_ I can relate.  I always get uneasy before a big test.  And I always end up cramming and studying the last minute.
Well as long as you know the basic concepts and material and have it fresh in your mind for tomorrow_comma_ you should do fine.  I find I always worry and end up doing better than i expected.
I cannot stand that!  Did this happen to you recently?
Did you say anything to the waitress? I've always wanted to but never have.  My husband tells me not to say anything because then they will spit on my food.
Beautiful! You must be so proud!
That's such a great idea! Dance is a great exercise for kids.
That's sounds like a lot of fun! What did you guys do?
I am glad ya'll had a blast. It's always good to spend some quality time with the fam.
Did you have fun there by yourself at least?
You should have joined one of the other groupls and pretended to belong.  See who would've said something first.
Me too! Gouda is my all time fav. What's yours?
Oh yeah_comma_ a good mozzarella sounds pretty primo right now. Perhaps I'll get some mozz sticks from Little Caesars.
Whoo! What trick was it? How old is he?
So cute! You must be so proud! You should teach him more tricks!
Could there be a reason that he is?
It must be frustrating! How are you gonna go about doing it?
Fun! You guys got to spend a lot of time together?
Did he pass? At least you got to appreciate him and show him your love
I agree! How annoying that is!
I was of been furious as well. How could they ruin a nice day!!
Wow that is a long time. How did you keep it together that long?
I was hoping for an easier way_comma_ but I guess like all worthwhile things hard work is key
Oh what show?
hm must've been a really controversial show.
Oh_comma_ me too! What do you love about it?
If only it was Christmas all year long_comma_ hu?
How exciting!  What kind of restaurant to you want to open?
That sounds amazing! We need a Korean restaurant in our town_comma_ I would love for one to open here!
That's so sad. Did she live a happy and fulfilled life?
That's so nice! Perhaps you should dwell on good memories like that of her to rid yourself of your sadness. We have to remember the good times with our loved ones!
Oh I bet!  Did you take him outside?
I use puppy pads in my house in case my dog needs to use the bathroom in the house.   Those seem to work pretty good!
oh wow nice! its never too late.
makes me think_comma_ what am i doing to reach my goals today?!
That's great news! You must be excited!
Oh gosh. Wonder why she won't be upfront about it.
You must be so proud and happy! What a young athelete in the making
Wow! Sounds like he was the MVP of the team!
Tornadoes can be so terrifying. My house was swept up by one when I was a little kid. But I guess it was okay_comma_ since I ended up meeting a talking scarecrow_comma_ a tin man_comma_ and a big ole lion.
It is indeed! It was all swell and dandy until the darn flying monkeys swooped in. That really put a damper on things.
Oh my! What did she do?
Wow_comma_ she sounds like an awful person. I feel bad for her son for not being able to get his car.
I bet your excited about it!
I bet you anticipate it to be good like usual!
I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you can find a similar place around you!
How long have you been waiting for? Hang in there.
That's awesome. 1 year down. Keep at it_comma_ buddy.
hahaha I have not heard that from many people.
I know! Then you get to the bowling alley_comma_ try to do what they do_comma_ end up getting 3 gutter balls in a row_comma_ and fall flat on your butt to boot!
Me and you both_comma_ friend. We can always try and have a blast though! I'm sure if we keep at it we'll get a turkey in a century or two.
Ugh_comma_ are you nervous about it?
That's great to hear. Your confidence will no doubt help you tomorrow.
How did that go? Studying is very important in order to do good. 
How annoying that could be. She could have alittle more respect for you. 
How frustrating! I hope you were able to study just a little though.  
Im sorry man! stay optimistic! dont be sad about it. 
You should definitely change roommates. I had been through such experience and know how more difficulty he can bring. Stay away from irresponsible people
Don't get emotional with him and don't let anger to ruin your relationship with him. Just distance yourself from him. That is it
That really stinks. Is there any way you'll be able to keep up with him to ease the sadness?
That's really rough_comma_ my friend. I am sure there must be other folks that you can befriend! There's plenty of nice and kind people in the world.
Oh no I am so sorry to hear that! 
I can't imagine how much that much hurt. I hope you can at least cherish the memories you had together.
Nice! What so happens to be on the Master Chef's menu?
That's sounds delicious. I am sure it'll be much better than whatever Pizza Hut can make!
I would have been running away. What did you do?
LOL....that trash would have been on the ground.
Oh nice. What type of stuff does the store sell?
That's cool. I like when stores are organized and not a chaotic mess!
Did this happen recently?  Did you take it back and admit the error?
Well_comma_ you may want to think about admitting it to the store manager and paying for it.  Especially if it's bothering you this much_comma_ it's the ony way to resolve it.
That really sucks. Is it because your mom was in the hospital? I am a psychic_comma_ so I tend to know these things.
I am so sorry for your loss. It seems that I have to re-calibrate my psychic abilities.
Are you nervous about it? Hope it goes well.
Well maybe you should start with a small slope and work your way up. Don't terrify yourself.
Oh man.  Now I am having images of the movie "It" in my head.  What did you do?
That is unusual behavior for a clown.  I would say you might want to call the authorities.  There has to be a law against a creepy clown stalker
Yeah_comma_ ice cream really hits the spot when you're tired.  Especially when it's hot in the summer time like this.
When the sun is burning like this I'd like nothing more than to just lay under a soft serve machine and pull the handle.  Good times!
Nice! I bet your are excited about this
Nice. Its nice to know he is content with this decision. 
Oh no! How boring. Could you call up a few buddies to hang out?
I can agree. Dont be too down. Im sure you can find someting to keep you busy. 
That's horrible. Were you able to get it up before it stained?
Yeah_comma_ one look at a cute face like that and it's hard to be mad.
That sucks. Did you tell him to go back and get the other one?
I would've taken that pizza out of the box and smack him upside the head with it. What a lousy guy!
Oh no! Did your dog have to go really bad or what happened?
Hopefully with enough training your puppy will let you know when she has to go. It takes time.
I feel ya! Do you have any big plans?
Nice! I've been in San Diego for the past two weeks hitting up the beach. I wish I could go with ya_comma_ since my vacation is coming to an end!
Are you ready for it?
Yeah I have faith in ya!!  Tear it up!
That is amazing. What a lovely and caring partner you have. You must be a happy person. Was it for any special occasion or just a surprise gift?
That is cute. You should also surprise your partner then with some adorable gift in return of this favor
That's good to hear_comma_ friend! I've been trying to work off my debt as well. Once it's done_comma_ I'm going to chop those things up.
I hear you. That really helped me out a bunch too. It'll be so nice when we're both debt free!
You must be so proud_comma_ but what was it for?
He must have worked really hard and it paid off. Good for him.
That would have been a pleasant surprise!!
you got a special niece. So talented and Kind.
Oh wow! I bet she and you are so excited about it!
What a nice surprise that is! I bet you anticipate her to love it!
That's awful. I hope you can find a new job.
That a fart can hospitalize anyone is pretty impressive.  Did your story make the local news?
Oh no_comma_ do you think your teacher will find out?
At least you have learned your lesson_comma_ I hope? 
Did you have fun? It's always great to face your fears!
Yay! I always find myself really nervous before the ride_comma_ but once I'm off of it_comma_ I want to go again! 
That sounds so embarrassing! Are you okay?
I am glad you're okay and you laughed it off. Just be careful the next time!
How exciting. What was it and did you cry?
Now that is a very interesting first word.
How nice of him! How did you earn such an honorable gesture?
Ah_comma_ well_comma_ I hope you enjoyed it! I am sure that won't happen often.
Well Happy Birthday. Do you have any plans?
Sounds like yall will have a blast! 
Awesome!!! What was the word?
Holy cow!  Why didn't he say Bernie Sanders "match me"!?
What really grinds your gears_comma_ friend? Rotten potatoes? Beverly hillbillies?
I hate mine too! I want to smash that thing with a sledgehammer!
Oh no! Was your neighbor upset about it.I bet your embarrassed.
I agree. You must find a way to preventthis so you dont get embarrassed again. 
I am sure they were happy tears.  How long had it been?
That is a long time.  I am sure you have a lot of catching up to do
omg. Driving skills are going down nowadays. You must very angry about it
You should have chased him and must give your piece of mind
Oh me TOO!!!!  That and Hee Haw both!  How did you cope?
Oh man.  So the cancellation of Beverly Hillbillies took a toll on your health?
Oh wow! Sounds like a wonderful time. Which one you taking them to?
Whatever they preach on Beverly Hillbillies is the law of nature. If they were afraid of coasters_comma_ I would be too. Tread lightly_comma_ friend.
Nice! Where are you going to do it?
I am sure you will too. When I did_comma_ I thought I was on top of a mountain! (but I really wasn't because I was plummeting towards the earth)
Wow you must be so happy about it. 
Anyway_comma_ you got it now. I so happy for it. Next you need take a precaution
Oh no! I bet your disappointed in his actions!
Im sorry about that. Im sure hes embarrassed about. I would be furious!
Good Job to her! I bet you were so proud of her!
Thats so good.I bet your overjoyed about it
That is never good.  Did you go out and check on it?
At least you will have a fun story to tell at parties.
Oh nice!  Did you have fun?  Did you finally jump?
haha.  I would've passed out and never woke up!  Silly me!
Do you like toads?
That was nice of your girlfriend_comma_ do you love her?
That's nice. What color did you paint it?
Those are swell colors! I am sure they will bring any guests much joy and merriment.
That's disappointing. I'm glad that you didn't let that stop you_comma_ and that you still went out and had a good time!
Why weren't your friends able to come?
Wow_comma_ that's kinda mean
You think he will be there next time so you can help him?
haha_comma_ was that intentional to get revenge on him/her. or just that you were hungry?
haha. Did you tell him about it?
Very nice. I bet you were full of joy to see them.
I bet they are very sentimental to you. Being able to remember those days must feel good
Very sweet of him. Did he surprise you?
Nice! Hes a sweet kid. I bet that brought you joy as well.
That is good_comma_ maybe you can get a raise.
Will you work there forever?
Ah that sucks_comma_ you were going for any business meeting?
i hope you didn't lose that client
Oh wow_comma_ that's not good at all
Yeah_comma_ that sounds no good_comma_ what will you do now?
wow_comma_ you must have been out of this world
Only woman knows the hardship and endurance of pregnancy. I am happy for you
How nostalgic! Was there anything in there that surprised you?
That's so cute. How old were you?
What is going on this weekend?
Are you driving with anyone?
Uh oh.  Better go back and get it!
Oh dang.  Thats awful.  Maybe someone will let you borrow some?
Oh yeah? Why is that?
That's awful. Did you confront him?
Is it your first date with her?
Where are you taking her?
That's exciting! What do you plan to do with it?
Wonderful! Where are you going to go?
Are you looking forward to an event happening then?
Awesome! That should be a lot of fun!
That is great_comma_ how long have you been married?
That must be a good feeling.
Third is very good! What kind of race?
Oh wow! Do you do a lot of marathons?
Hey you should give that back
Hey you should give the money back
What happened?
Did you take a photo of them?
Keep trying_comma_ never give up.
Maybe you should go to a temp agency.
I am so sorry to hear that. How long have you had him?
You must have developed strong attachments to him over all these years. To be honest_comma_ I am not an animal lover individual
Good that you done! Have a relaxing day!
Awesome! enjoy your own time!
How sweet that is. Enjoy all these little moments. Snap a picture if you can to remember it.
I wish I could see her doing it. Who knows maybe you have a future ballerina on your hands.
Nikes are usually pretty cool. What do you like about the new ones?
Did you buy some yet? 
That must be a great feeling.
Hopefully you can keep it that way.
Why did he left?
Oh_comma_ for how long he will be away?
Wow. It's really a super moment to cherish.
Oh_comma_ It's great that he scored good grade though he didn't study well.
Is his name Jessie by chance?
Because of that popular song years ago.  
That is terrible_comma_ did you cry?
Will you get a new dog?
That's horrible_comma_ what happened?
That sounds like an awful thing to see. Will it be hard to replace?
What did you order?
How much did those cost?
It takes a lot of discipline to get prepared for the LSAT exam and apply to schools.
Good luck! I'm sure you can do it!
Sorry to hear_comma_ Why did she do this to you?
Oh_comma_ then you too take break!
What did you lie about?
She must be very mad at you.
Oh no_comma_ what's wrong with your dog?
That's terrible! I hope the operation goes smoothly.
Oh_comma_ that's pretty cool_comma_ how long did it took?
I'm glad to hear it made you very happy_comma_ which car are you going to get?
That is bad news_comma_ hope you go visit her.
Make sure you visit her every day.
I can understand that. Have you ever been up close to one?
That is how I feel about mice
Why?  Don't like the hot weather?
I hear ya.  That's why I stay inside with the AC!!
What is that?
You should throw it out the window.
That's never fun. hope you can find something else to do.
Yea_comma_ good luck for a reschedule.
That's unfortunate. What are you going to do to keep yourself busy all weekend?
Sleeping in should be a positive thing! Take this as your time for yourself and relax.
Where will you be heading?
Where is that located.
Wow_comma_ which team you support
nice _comma_ good luck for your new season!!
That's sad_comma_ when did it died?
Of natural causes?
What happened to make that almost happen?
What did she do with the money?
Friends are so useful and nice to have on happy and sad days.
Same here for sure but they make gloomy days a lot better.
That is a long time_comma_ has he gone to a doctor?
That is a long time also.
All you can do is prepare the best you can. After that there's not much else you can do.
That they are. Just don't psych yourself out. Relax and you will do well.
Wow_comma_ you are sentimental i guess!!
you are who you are!!. Sentimental people are so kind hearted!!
Oh yeah that is a really big step. Have you guys talked about it yet/
It's a hard decision. I think you guys should weigh everything together before making a final choice_comma_ to be sure.
That sounds terrible! What happened? 
That is so gross! 
Wow_comma_ that is a big inheritance. What do you plan to do with it?
Yeah_comma_ it's better to make some good choices with that amount of money.
That sucks! Did you have to go back for it?
Did they at least throw in something extra for the trouble?
Man sounds like they have 'great' costume service.
Wow! Ask for a refund or some extra stuff!
Dang_comma_ well at least you got your money
I feel you. I once stole drumsticks. I swear it is something about being a teenager.
No problem!
Oh that sucks_comma_ getting sick is the worst. Hope you feel better soon. Take vitamin C_comma_ it really does help some people. 
Yea better play it safe so that it doesn't get worse.
Congratulations! That's probably a health choice that you've made.
Well_comma_ I don't want to pry_comma_ but I hope everything is going well for you now and wish you all the best.
Well_comma_ the past is in the past. All you can do now is try your best moving forward.
Did you ask a friend for help?
That's great. So everything went well?
I was worried you were going to say something bad happened. I'm relived. 
I have. Sometimes it's nice to see what old friends have been up to_comma_ and what new friends have done. I don't think it's too strange.
That definitely changes things. I could understand how that might be considered weird_comma_ I agree.
He charged you?
Did it all work out? Or did he completely mess up your car hah
Sounds like you've got a lot of faith in your friend.
Oh really?! I love to read! What book was it?
I've never read it_comma_ but I might check it out! 
That's so nice of you. I have been in that place_comma_ where I needed help_comma_ and was incredibly grateful to those who helped. How did it make you feel?
I understand! I just got back to that point of being financially stable. I'm happy to help where I can but it is tough
I do not have children YET_comma_ But hopefully in the future. as long as they are easy to handle.
Everyone i talk to say the same thing which has always kind of put me off.
REALLY.. OLD AGE IS A PART OF OUR LIFE.. BETTER ENJOY THAN FEELING SAD
IT IS GOOD THAT YOU ACCEPTED MY WORDS.. CHEER UP .. EVERYTHING GOING TO BE ALRIGHT.. 
I do agree. It seems like more and more people are going through rough times these days. Nobody wants to do anything about it.
A lot of people say they care about these issues but I'd like to see more people put their money where there mouth is. We do live in a society.
Oh that sounds so fun_comma_ do you have a black belt?
I understand that_comma_ I don't even like going to the gym_comma_ because I feel like people are always watching me and it makes me feel awkward. 
That is the worst_comma_ I always hated school when they would make you stand up in front of the class and do things_comma_ even worse when you have to do it with someone you are not friends with!
Oh no what happened once they got your information?
Did they get any money?
I am sorry for your loss. How did he die if you don't mind me asking?
That's terrible... At least you tried to save him.
I bet that was so scary for you! Did they find out what was wrong?
That's a relief! I'm glad to hear that he is doing great now!
Nervous about the person or nervous that they won't take it?
You should have someone with you. An intimidating person. Like your mother in law.
Yikes! That would be really scary!! I hope you didn't get in the car!
Thank goodness it all worked out! It sounds like you took a bunch of smart precautions!
That must have been so stressful. What did you do?
Thank goodness you found them_comma_ and kept your promise.
Wow! I hope it didn't cause a lot of damage_comma_ I have a bunch of very tall trees in my yard as well.
That's terrible I'm sorry to hear that. I'm also glad you have insurance.
Oh I've done that_comma_ I hate when that happens. Are you going to see them again soon?
I hope he makes good on his word! Sometimes losing your ID can be a very big deal_comma_ I know it was when I've lost mine.
Awww! How sweet! I love kittens_comma_ but it sounds like a lot of work!
That was so kind of you to take her in. Poor little thing needed a new caregiver!
I hate that feeling. I spent $50 on groceries I didn't exactly need. so I know how you feel.
If I remember right shopping triggers our happy centers. It is hard to stop
Could turn out good_comma_ Could turn out bad. How well do you know your friend?
Well i wish you the best of luck and hope it goes well!
Oh that's good_comma_ you both must have had a very trusting relationship.
That's good_comma_ but why aren't you still together now ?
Yea_comma_ sometimes we take those who care about us for granted.
I'm in Florida_comma_ jump and a bus come back_comma_ we need you!
That's understandable_comma_ no one knows your pets like you do.
Yea_comma_ at the end of the day I guess all you can do is hope for the best.
Oh no! I hope everything is ok! Was she mad?
It can happen I bet. Just try to make this the only time_comma_ and in my experience_comma_ you're going to have to pull out all the stops with this dinner!
That is so sweet. I love cats_comma_ but I'm allergic to them so we can't have any. It makes me sad.
I'm glad they help you forget about all your cares though. You are lucky to have them
What? How? Is it OK now?
Well that's good news at least! i Hope you are better too.
Oh my God_comma_ that's horrible. I'm really sorry to hear that. I hope you're doing okay.
Nothing can really replace a loved pet you had for a long time_comma_ all you have is memories really.
It's important to have faith that things will work out the way they should! I'm a strong believer in that!
Sometimes it's hard when things seem to always go against you. Just remember that God doesn't give us more than we can handle! You'll come out a stronger person in the end. I wish you the best!
You can always use and old mason jar wrapped in some hemp fiber
Oh you can be! Everyone can! It just takes the will to cut the fabric! 
It's always a good thing to be able to focus on things that don't have to do with money. 
No need to be sorry! You are at a place that we all should be able to be but for many reasons can not. Good job!
you know sometimes it is hard to predict something like that
but if you don't buy now_comma_ as the prices go higher_comma_ you will regret it
Oh I'm sorry to hear that but I'm glad you have a good friend! 
Hopefully everything has been uphill since then! 
Exciting_comma_ what concert?
That would be so nice_comma_ I have not went to a concert in ages
That's too bad. We always want to give our kids the things they want. I'm sure he'll understnad
Well there will be plenty of time for him to still build that skill as he grows up
Oh that sounds nice_comma_ have you had trouble in the past staying committed?
Well_comma_ life isn't a football game_comma_ so "fumbles" are something that everyone does.
I know exactly what you mean. It's really tough but when I make decisions I try to stand on them and be willing to pivot if necessary.
That sounds right to me. I actually have a few people around me that give me straight forward advice like that.
Sometimes it can be true. Don't be taken for a run 
I hope that everything turns out the best for you too! 
Congratulations_comma_ that sounds like things are moving along at a nice pace.
That's understandable_comma_ I'm sure it will be exciting to customize and furnish your space.
How long has it been since you had your old dog?
It might take a bit of time to get back into the swing of owning a dog. I'm sure you'll be ready soon if you still think it over.
I lost my job_comma_ so I know how you feel. It is tough not have a source of income. 
Sometimes you got to just do it and hope and pray all comes out like it should_comma_ and it usually does. 
It's never to late to continue on that path or find a new one. Same happened here.
I always try to remind myself. Tomorrow is a new day. What do you want to do with yours?
That's terrible. I don't know what's up with this world anymore_comma_ it seems like things are always getting worse.
Well if they were family heirloom or photographs_comma_ I don't really think the money would have been important. The family passes down antiques and precious items for keeping.
Have you tried talking to them about this? 
That's really frustrating_comma_ they'll realize only when you start distancing yourself from them
Did you hear anything about what happened at that camp in your absence? I hope there were no hard feelings!
Sorry for the delay. I had a technical difficulty. Either way_comma_ I'm sure there were no hard feelings. A lot of people sign up to work those camps every year.
That's completely understandable. Have you tried distracting yourself with hobbies or productive chores?
That's the best thing you can do really. I hope she comes back soon for your sake!
Any ice cream on sale sounds like a good time to me. I've never heard of Blue Bell though_comma_ is it any good?
I'll need to find some and give it a taste myself! That sounds awesome.
Oh no_comma_ that's such an awful thing for them to do. Do your cats often ruin things in the household?
Oh odd. That's a good way to look at it though; too many people get too angry with their pets over these type of things.
And is he okay with that?
I suppose that makes sense. As long as both of you are happy with your relationship dynamic_comma_ that's all that counts!
What happened to yours?
That is a real shame_comma_ at least you can hold on to your memories.
Dang that's a definite mood killer. At least you've got a fix on the way.
One can only hope!
Well from what i have read we will all be drowning which isn't good.
Yeah forest fires are getting really bad.
Odd! Any idea where you went wrong?
Practice definitely makes perfect!
How old are they now?
Soon they will be leaving the nest_comma_ hey?
I'm sorry to hear that.  Are you better now?
I hope it is nor Samonella_comma_ just a temporarily bug.
You guys sound like great grand kids_comma_ I bet she wholeheartedly appreciated it.
I bet you guys were close and this certainly brought you all closer together. I'm so happy that you had these connections with your family.
Sounds like fun!  Did you enjoyed it? How far did you go?
Great! love road trips!  I hope to take one soon.
Why has your week been so busy?
Do you know what movie you plan on watching?
yikes! That must have caught you off guard.
Murphy's law i suppose. I'm sure it wasn't so bad though in the end.
Oh no! Did he take it okay?
That's sweet that you guys are able to let the small things go. It sounds like you have a great relationship.
I'm in the same boat. I'm so happy to hear that and I hope you get the job!
Companies that pay their workers well equals happy workers!
Are you excited for the new group?
Well_comma_ I hope it goes well!
Must be hard when you can't physically see what you are doing.
Yeah YouTube is a good source of information.
Oh no that sucks! What book?
Ah I've never read it before_comma_ I was hoping it would have been one I'm familiar with.
Oh the nostalgia of watching old movies. What movie?
Unfortunately I've never heard of it!
I used to want to do that so bad when I was younger. Was it amazing?
That's so awesome. I don't think I would have the courage now. Will you do it again?
That's a great goal to set for yourself. Where do you work if I may ask?
Sounds important. I hope you're able to meet your goal!
It must be nice to have that kind of trust for someone_comma_ and motorcycles can be fun!
Awesome. I've only rode dirt bikes personally_comma_ but i definitely see the appeal. 
Aw_comma_ I've been there_comma_ I bet you like it!  Especially after you get used to it.
That is such a great attitude!
That's terrifying! I bet you didn't sleep that night!
HA! Are you a fan of horror movies now_comma_ or do you still find them scary?
Yeah_comma_ me either_comma_ although there have been some good ones lately. Better stories_comma_ more plot. 
I am sorry to hear that_comma_  I hope it is only a temporarily situation and you will be on your feet in no time.
Yes I know.  It hasn't been easy for me either_comma_ but I believe think will go our way pretty soon.
Wow that's so exciting! I bet he's a nice guy in real life. 
Cool! That's so neat. 
Oh no. Maybe you can find one that is used_comma_ or even rebuilt. I got my car for 75% less than what I would've paid from a car dealer!
Well_comma_ stick through it! I wish you luck :) 
Oh_comma_ I could do that if I didn't have bad teeth and can't handle the cold. I would regret it if I did though because I really need to lose some weight.
Lol_comma_ burn those calories. Hope you have a high metabolism.
What happened?
Well_comma_ you gave him the benefit of the doubt. It was his decision to cheat. 
Now you have more information to base your next decision on. You live you learn.
That's kind of him! Is he good at that sort of thing?
Yes you'd have more warranty kind of things with work from a dealership
That's awesome! I wish someone in my family was so handy!
Wow! Maybe you should take uncle out for dinner! LOL
Me too. Old photos bring about such nostalgia.
I can only imagine! When my parents open old photo albums of my siblings and I_comma_ they get teary-eyed.
Wow_comma_ that's such an honor.  How do you feel about it?
I'd be very nervous too.  I get stage fright.
I bet that whipped up a lot of feelings inside of you. I'm sorry for your loss.
That's great. It's just as good to remember the great times you spent together as it is to grieve.
Get away with what?
Did you get caught using them?!
Wow! That's terrible! Maybe next time just get a tutor instead of cheating!
Sorry this happened!
Oh dear! What happened!?
Oh my goodness! Good for you for getting away from that trouble!
Next day guilt when the fun is done. How awful. I wonder if they'll fess up.
Yikes. I'm glad you're not mixed up in that!
How did that go? Do you like that? 
Oh no! Really? Were they upset?
Who was it with?
Were you more mad at them or your spouse?
What was it?  Did everything turn out alright?
Phew! I'm glad that's all it was.
That's terrible when friends fight. What was it over?
That's got to be a tough phone call to make. Did you two make amends or is she very upset?
Uh oh don't want to be that kid that's for sure!
How interesting.  How does that make you feel?
Yes_comma_ I think that would be a little surreal_comma_ and I might feel ambivalent about it.
I felt the same way as you_comma_ but what's the point of keeping things you don't use and having it take up space? Do you use everything in your closet? 
So the items are sentimental to you? I know how hard it is to part with items that have memories behind them_comma_ but at the end of the day_comma_ they are just items! :)
Oh how sweet! What did it say?
I love finding treasures like that! 
I hope that I am able to share such nice things with my own kids one day.
I really enjoy that too!
That is a lot of work! But I bet the reunion will be fun. 
Yum_comma_ I love making and also eating desserts! Do you have a specialty?
Oh that's one of my faves. My go to is cheesecake. 
It's a crowd pleaser. I love the dips and apps at get togethers like that. 
Is that like hospice care? How do you deal with seeing loss so frequently?
I'm sure you do a great job of making these people feel cared for and loved in their final times.
I bet it is. Thank you for giving your time to this type of work.
You deserve them! That's excellent to hear.
Oh no! I hate when I'm hungry for something and it goes wrong like that!
The worst! Did you find something else to eat?
Better than nothing but still no patty melt!
That's exciting. Is that something you want to do?
That could definitely be tough. Especially with a baby.
Really_comma_ did you get to pick the movie?
Oh wow thats always nice when everyone can agree on the same movie.
That's always nice_comma_ how did you respond?
That's cool_comma_ nothing wrong with being faithful. 
Nice_comma_ jobs are ok_comma_ but a new ride is really fun. What did you get
Toyota's usually last a long time so it might be a good decision.
Wow_comma_ was it embarrassing?
Dang! Well at least you got a good story to tell now!
oh really_comma_ hopefully its a pretty nice job cause moving is not fun.
Well at least you get to be with the man you love...hopefully
As long as you're safe about it. You can meet up at police stations too! 
More people are open and into it so yo ucan always talk to your police about it
Wow. That's a long time. Longer than I've been alive! Congrats on your successful marriage. Got any tips?
Thanks for the advice. I have trouble letting the petty things go but I think I'll learn to be better as time goes by. I wish you a happy marriage! 
Ohhhh_comma_ that's so sad. I remember (long ago) when that happened to me. Did he/she live a good long life?
Yeah_comma_ that is a shame. I'm so sorry to hear about your loss. I know how important a great teacher can be your life.
Are you nervous? Or do you have amazing confidence in your ability?
Do make sure to get a good nights sleep before hand. That is just as important.
How old is your son?
I can understand why you felt so nervous. A mothers attachment is rather strong to a newborn. You should get him a gaurd dog when he's a bit older if you still feel that way.
Wow! I enjoy watching Overwatch on Twitch occasionally. Would you say that's your favorite game?
I never got into COD and I tried Overwatch when it first came out but I wasn't very good. Fortnite on the other hand I'm alright at. 
That's awesome! What did you have done?
I can imagine. Things like are always so stressful_comma_ but so nice once they are completed.
Make sure to bring smores and bug spray. I hate bug bites. and love chocolate 
Make sure you bring something to drink as well. can get quite thirsty ya know.
Oh I feel you! Every time I go back to stay with my family it feels... claustrophobic almost.
I'm sure they are! Itll feel more normal soon_comma_ I am sure
What's wrong with your tooth? I hope it's not too painful of an experience.
Yikes! I've had that before. My thoughts are with you. I'm sure the dentist will take care of it though.
That's awful.  What are you going to do?
What type of dog is it?
Interest are you going to try and get him to sell it?
That will be fun_comma_ maybe he will even let you play his xbox on it.
Same. When you had one phone in the middle of the house with the SUPER long phone cord so you could at least get around the corner to talk.
I agree. The convenience is nice now_comma_ but the quality is much lower.
Were you close to your wife's grandmother?
That is very heartbreaking. Im sure she had a very positive opinion of you as well.
Im sure your wife also appreciates you getting along with her family.
Those times seemed much simpler didn't they? Do you ever break out of the routine?
I see. How do you like playing the piano?
That's the spirit. I bet you're a wonderful pianist.
Awesome! Anything exciting on the horizon to treat yourself?
What's the one you are most excited about?
Well that stinks.  What are they drilling for?
Are they almost done with it?
Oh no what happened?
That is sad.  I am sure you can come up with a good career.  What do you like to do?
That's exciting and nerve wracking at the same time I bet. How do you feel about it?
For sure. Well good luck! Nurses are very under-appreciated. I hope you get.
that can be tough but it also can be great to have time for yourself
i can see where isolation can be overwhelming and the need for social contact is desirable and needed
Oh that's exciting. Are you nervous to have them over?
I bet it's all in your head. I am sure it will all good smooth.
Aww that's so cute! Was it tough trying to get it to swim?
Proud of the little pup!
That's so creepy and scary. What happened next?
Why are there so many weirdos in this world? I'm glad you made it out safe.
What for? I hope it wasn't for anything dangerous.
That's a little dangerous. I'd definitely talk to her about why you didn't allow her to go to that party_comma_ and maybe she'll realize that what you're doing is for her own good.
Yes I understand!  It is so hard to lose weight!
Yes.  Chocolate is my nemesis.  I think it is more addicting than cocaine
Ouch_comma_ that's unfortunate. Hopefully it turned out okay though?
I can imagine_comma_ talk about bad timing injuring your toes!
Oh no! Did you get in trouble?
Good for you for standing up for your little brother. hope the kid is ok though.
Sometimes when you are looking back at a situation you get a whole new perspective now that you're away from it. I'm happy that you have that realization.
Are they gone now or is a reunion possible?
God's Plan! Do you know why he did it?
Dang_comma_ I wish I could have it happen to me someday!
That's great!  Such a satisfying feeling!  Did you get a good grade?
I hope you were really proud of yourself :-)
That's really good news. It must be frustrating to move from place to place constantly. Is your family happy with the place?
I hope you and your family enjoy the new home.
Amen. What kind of dogs do yo have?
Aw little guys. Do they walk well on the leash?
That's about how mine is. He is a bit bigger so he pulls a little harder. I found using a harness has helped.
He is a mix breed. We don't really know.
That sounds great! Are you excited?
I hope you accomplish everything!
Oh my goodness. That must have been traumatic to see. Do you know what happened to the dog?
Well_comma_ I'm sorry you had to see that!
I agree with that. I always try to give the benefit of the doubt at first.
Oh man. Bless your soul! I bet that can test your patience.
Im sure it can be highly rewarding too.
I'm glad it's over and nothing happened. do you have an underground shelter?
Oh_comma_ I would be scared too. apartments seem safe unless the roof gets ripped of of coarse.
Are you excited?
I hope you do it!
congratulations! that is exciting. How long have you been waiting for this.
Very cool. I wish you all the best.
I'm a freelancer
started out slow but now it is!
Oh no! Not the old pop on the rug trick. Did you yell?
What kind of dog? I have a boston terrier. She's the cutest. 
Oh cute! What a devil. 
Mine too. Can't help it_comma_ those eyes!
Oh no! Did you have to go home and change?
What a bummer! Sorry to hear that. 
That is so cool! Im not married yet
Maybe_comma_ im not sure yet
Aw that's tough!  Have you talked to him about it?
It might have upset him but I'm sure he'll understand!  Everyone loses their temper sometimes and it's not like you didn't have a legit reason
I hope it's a lot more than just a gift card but at least Starbucks should be a lot of money because it's so expensive there!
oh yes then you need much more than a starbucks gift card!  good luck!!
I am sorry that must have been tough.  She probably felt bad for you.
That is great because friendships are very important
Ok_comma_thats lovely
Its shows a lot of care
A point of what? Like_comma_ of land?
Oh boy. I'm not sure where you'd find one. That's pretty old fashioned. Did you find one?
Oh no! That must have put you in a bad position. How did you handle it?
Sounds like a great way of handling a potentially sticky situation - good job!
hi friend who is too good to you?
that's good though! I bet you're grateful.
Thats so cool of you
Yea_comma_thats the right thing to do
I know! That must be frustrating. Do you have enough money to cover it?
Oh wow... it seems like bad things always hit at once like that. Hang in there - I hope it will get better for you!
I'm sure it was scary to leave your kids for the time but at least it was their aunt and not a stranger! 
Oh that's so great - and now you can feel comfortable leaving them with her more often!
It does sound like fun_comma_ though. Did you have a good time?
Are you ever going to do it again or are you done? I went when I was a child. 
True. Easier said than done though. How can we be?
Definetly! it starts with a single person right
Did  you layer had the surgery?
Oh_comma_congrats dear
Oh_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that! That must have been upsetting.
Then you must have felt relief.
oh I am so sorry_comma_ I am assuming the injury was serious?
oh man I hope you got a second opinion? I would be so worried about your injury. I am so sorry.
Hasn't everyone done so at some point?
Atleast it wasn't in class at a college or something_comma_ right?
I wouldn't sweat it_comma_ chances are you won't see any of those people again right? Even if you do_comma_ it's unlikely they'll remember you let alone your smelly fart.
oh my gosh that's so cute! I bet they were the cutest.
I'm sure it does_comma_ I don't have any of my own but I would be really sentimental.
Yes_comma_ but think of all the opportunities it can open up. Don't let fear stop you!
I know_comma_ but I'm sure you'll do great! I went to school for many years through a Master's degree_comma_ and although it was hard_comma_ it was worth it. 
Did she forget it at home or did she just not bother turning it in?
Be happy that you were able to spend some time with her and sharing personal time with her by helping her with her homework. Not many parents do that for their children
oh no! I bet you were so mad! were you able to find something else to snack on?
That is heartbreaking. That sounds really good. Never purchased one of those.
I am completely agree.  How long have you been married?
Constant work and attention is key to a great relationship!
That sucks.  I hate having scratched glasses
Yes and it always bothers me looking through scatches.
I'm so sorry to hear that. I was together with my wife for 7 years when she left me so I know your pain.
It takes awhile for it to be over. Find a hobby to take your mind off of it. It helps to ease the pain.
yes_comma_ that is always a hard situation.  
oh man that is horrible!  I am so sorry
That's the best decision. I know mine wouldn't either. If he is a good guy_comma_ he will understand.
That's good. No sense in rocking the boat.
It is definitely good to get that looked at right away. Then they can take care of it!
Oh I know it's hard. Just try to relax and it will go quick. 
Nice! Did it help you become less stressed?
Dang_comma_ well I hope you can continue your goal of meditating every day!
Scared of what
Oh_comma_dont mind me_comma_just been curious
Why is that?
I feel that_comma_ plus it's nice not to have to worry about returning it.
Oh thats not good..sometimes teenagers can be alittle messy
Well I am sure he will get better with age
I think theme park rides are scary! Was it scary when you were stuck?
They are really good about that. They have a lot of safety features you don't even realize. We were stuck on Space Mountain once. 
Awww_comma_ you're speaking fondly on when he was young. Is he not as nice anymore?
That's depressing to here. I have family members who are still cool now as well_comma_ but I just think so fondly on when they were younger. They grow up too fast_comma_ and it really is amazing when they're young and innocent and haven't been exposed to the real world yet.
I suppose_comma_ but research and concrete knowledge is more beneficial as it is a very hands on and physical occupation_comma_ especially when the health of others are in their hands.
That is true. There are many situations where experience can strengthen your skills compared to just learning it from a book.
Dogs are wonderful pets. They are so loving and devoted. What kind of dog do you have?
That's an awesome name. I have two feists. If you're not familiar with the breed_comma_ they resemble Jack Russell terriers_comma_ but they are bred for squirrel hunting. Their names are Whiskey and Ruby.
all the time I am not sure I believe in God
that's pretty crazy you could of had your money and the care package too
yeah I understand what you mean definitely
Oh_comma_ I am so sorry! I am an animal lover_comma_ too. We have two dogs now_comma_ but used to have cats_comma_ too. We did have to say goodbyes to some of our pets over years. It's heart breaking...
How long did you have your cat?
Was it a holiday?
It sounds like a fun event.
Oh no! That is so frustrating.
That is good that you are a nice friend to her. 
I am sure you were.  Was boot camp really hard
I could never do something like that.  Thank you for your service
Oh wow. I would hate that. What ended up being the issue?
Maybe he has forgotten how it feels to randomly be called into your bosses office. He's moved on up.
Oh no -- how is she feeling now?
Yeah_comma_ that had to be tough. I'm glad she's doing better now though. 
What a bummer! What place did you end up getting?
I know the feeling. You work so hard just to feel crushed.
Did you get hurt or drown a bit?
Nice_comma_ well hopefully nothing like that ever happens again!
I sure hope the hot dog was fit to eat 
Oh_comma_ you shouldn't feel bad about it_comma_ i'm sure it was fine to eat!
That's really good you guys can trust eachother like that. That helps make you both grow in the relationship.
Wow! You don't see much of that anymore. So true.
Yes_comma_ I am a product of a broken marriage. My children are too. Keep up the good work you guys!
Where were you not invited to?
You were not invited?! That's awful. How close are you to your friend?
Hey_comma_were you injured?
Hope they took it easy with you?
Aww that is so sweet.  I completely understand why!  Oh and thank you for your apology but I am truly content and have accepted it.
Men are crazy sometimes!  LOL!
Sounds like a fun one to me. Are you happy there?
I agree. Im sure you get bored or lonely while traveling too. 
who is that?
sometimes we have to learn how to not be jealous of things
Thats always a good feeling. I bet you are excited to come home everyday.
What a good dog and full of joy!
I bet she loves you just at much as you love her.
I hope you have a good time and you enjoy it.
I bet_comma_ everyone should take time out yo enjoy life every once in awhile.
Did you do it? How far does he live from you?
Oh no! Was he mad?
What happend?
What is a hot slap? Sounds painful!
They haven't called you back yet? I hate when that happens_comma_ they make you wait by the phone on pins and needles!
Don't let it break your confidence though_comma_ it just wasn't meant to be. I think you'll land your next application though.
Uncertainty can be so agonizing. Just keep your head up though!
Oh my gosh! Have they broken it? That would drive me nuts.
Have you spoken to them personally? Maybe they should pay for you to move it!
Wow. I'm so sorry. Maybe you could put concrete around it so it damages their car? lol
Wow that sounds intriguing_comma_ what new things did you try?
That's awesome_comma_ cows are amazing
Yeah_comma_ it's crazy how each year seems to go by faster than the last too_comma_ having kids must be surreal
Me too_comma_ it's like you realize more and more that all you have is the present moment.
Wow_comma_ congrats_comma_ what did you end up naming him?
You are lucky_comma_ and I am sure he will be tons of work but it will be worth it.
sounds exciting. I always wanted to leave my were I was originally from so I could experience and see new things
No_comma_ but i hope things work out for you in this new part of your life.
Oh definitely. Why did you?
I can. I'm so sorry. Was it something really bad? Or were you able to move on from it?
It's always fun to get new clothes! Is the wedding soon?
I'm not very fashionable_comma_ but I do have some t-shirts that I love to wear because they fit me really well.
Sounds like a real hard decision. I would be very apprehensive as well.
You sound so excited about it and your future there. I would be full of joy as well.
That sounds like some good work experience. How long is he in.
Well_comma_ hopefully he is as good as Sherlock Holmes and saves some lives.
That's the worst. I wonder if he was trying to prove something.
Good! I don't know why people think they can get away with things like that.
congrats_comma_ how did you handle the pressure?
It can be pretty nerve racking_comma_ but it is always great practice. You will only get better.
OMG! especially recently. a week seems like one day.
That's so true. My daughter moved out this year and I'm wondering where the heck the time went!
Oh really? Are you a massage therapist?
Wow congratulations! You must be so excited!
I'm good_comma_ what's up?
Yeah_comma_ that must be difficult
Way to go! If it makes you feel better I would be your friend if I was there
I used to_comma_ but yeah especially if you're not in school
Hope you didn't take a bath after that
Minus one for cats
Wow Brazil? Isn't there a lot of crime there?
What is she going to do there_comma_ sounds kind of dangerous.
That's good_comma_ how does that make you feel
Nice_comma_ I like your attitude
Nice_comma_ too bad I wasn't invited!
Sounds fun! Keep fighting the good fight lol
No! I think that should be on my bucket list though.
I bet that would be cool. I've watched on Tv. They know what their doing.
What are you waiting for?
Oh I totally know how that goes. I moved to small town and didn't have many friends at first. Once I had my son and made more friends it got way better lol!
Thanks_comma_ you as well. I know how that is. give it time and things will get better.
Yeah_comma_ I think it gets more difficult as you get older anyway.
Aw_comma_ I know how that goes. Do they visit often?
Wow that's sad. I'm sorry.
That does sound exciting! Why are you scared?
Oh_comma_ that is definitely a change! But at least you can still keep in touch nowadays.
Yeah I have one_comma_ but they're all over the place it seems like
That's funny_comma_ just don't let it in your room while your sleeping!
Babies are pretty small and delicate they look like they might break at the slightest bump.
It's a pretty small percentage_comma_ but it would definitely be something to worry about.
Wow that would be terrible news. I can't imaged shit is taking it well.
Hopefully she has a supportive partner to help her as well. Glad you are there to help her.
That is horrible_comma_ I am so sorry_comma_ It is hard losing a baby animal_comma_ you are not expecting them to pass_comma_ like when you have an older sickly one
That is crazy_comma_ I wonder what was wrong with it
Wow_comma_ I never knew cats could even get an aneurysm_comma_ but I guess like humans why wouldn't they be able to?
Ahhhh thats amazing! I stay home with my kids too! How many kids do you have?
It definitely can be a challenge. I have a 10 year old boy_comma_ an 8 year old girl_comma_ and a 2 year old girl. I love being home with them.
Oh no_comma_ what happened? Did they do or say something?
Oh girl_comma_ that happens to me all the time too. So frustrating_comma_ just leave us alone.
I'm sorry_comma_ is it difficult to take care of her?
Dang_comma_ I hope everything turns out okay for you guys
Hmm_comma_ how did that make you feel
Yeah_comma_ at least now you're more aware_comma_ it can be pretty tough when you're trying to break the habit though
Good to hear that you keep your word
Keep it up brochacho
At least that shows that you have a conscience. I hope that you made it up to them.
Confess to them what happened. Let them know how you have changed.
Wow_comma_ I am sure the Veterans loved it! What kind of treats did you and the kids bring to them?
So thoughtful of you! What did the kids think of visiting the veterans?
Wow that is some really early christmas shopping. you must like to plan ahead.
Yeah spending money on things is always a temporary high.
I love vegetable soup. So were you able to enjoy your nap ?
Well I'm happy for you. Its hard to catch a nap around here sometimes.
Sounds like she has some underlying issues with trust. You may want to sort it all out before you get too involved.
Maybe you couldn't but it sounds like something is going on with her. 
That was nice of them. Did you have any problems with their car?
THat is good to hear. What happened to your own car?
Well at least you can trust him to be careful.  I dont think I would be able to trust my nephew as he is only 18 and not very responsible yet.
Yes its amazing how much of  a difference a few years can make in age.  It seems that males take quite awile long to mature than females.   
That's so nice of you_comma_ I would have chased down the car_comma_ but you did the right thing
Feels bad_comma_ hope you have someone to talk about it with!
What kind of job is it?   I will keep my fingers crossed he gets it!
THats awesome_comma_ does it pay better than the one he has?  A pay increase is certainly helpful.
oh wow i am glad she was happy_comma_ why were you nervous?
oh don't be_comma_ you should be happy for her_comma_ there will come a time where you will get something back in return :)
Boy o-boy bet she is having the time of her life. How many vacations have you taken this year?
Me too_comma_ maybe our wish will come true only time will tell.
Oh_comma_ no! What happened?
Oh wow! That's like the worst nightmare! I'm so sorry that happened to you!!
Were you able to get out of there without anybody noticing or did you die from embarssment?
I'm sure that was not a fun ride home. 
where you disappointed? 
I remember the same thing. And the joy that followed for the next moth was pure bliss
Where do you live?
Alright_comma_ so do you ever have to evacuate?
maybe go earlier later?
oh_comma_ that's kind of weird
... im sorry_comma_ how did it happen
that sucks_comma_ but hey man it's okay one day you'll find right person 
Nice! The married life is expensive
I hope you two have a nice future. At least you know the family will support you!
Oh! What happened?
Wow! You lazy bum. You disappointed me too!
That sounds awful. Who was it you wronged?
Was she understanding and forgiving?
I'm sure you will be able to get another one fairly quickly!
I hope that you see amazing results_comma_ and you continue to enjoy yourself!
Do you think it's possible that he does still love you and also made a horrible mistake?
I think that when people cheat and lie_comma_ it's because something is wrong with them and not their partner.  If he doesn't realize his mistake_comma_ then he doesn't deserve your love.  I wish you all the best!
I hope you realize your worth too. I do this thing where I think about another woman in my life who I really care about (mom_comma_ daughter_comma_ etc.) and I think "if this was happening to them_comma_ what kind of advice would I give them?"  Sometimes_comma_ we think we deserve less.
what do you mean?
oh_comma_ what happend
yes i do_comma_ that's why i only trust one person_comma_ my wife
im sorry_comma_ what did happend next? how does that make you feel?
What happened to you?
That's horrible! Did you have any sort of tracker on it?
Awwe that is so sweet_comma_ how did you two meet? 
Wow that sounds like a really big journey. It must have been really hard to connect with one another only through online chats.
Mmm that sounds delicious. There is always time to make pancake Tuesdays at home!
I see_comma_ memories will always stay_comma_ sometimes good old days just can't come back.
I haven't_comma_ but it's definitely on my bucket list!
I bet it helped having someone there who knew what they were doing. 
I have a friend who recently became certified as an instructor. He jumps almost every weekend. He will be taking me when I go!
I believe I was fifteen. I drove a soccer mom van!
Did you ever get caught?!
Oh no! I would have been furious! Were you able to catch him?
Oh im so sorry! I bet your are devestated! I would be tool.
Oh okay.... was that even a temptation to begin with?
Alrighty then_comma_ just seemed like a really weird thing to say. 
Oh no that is awful! It is against the law where I live to ban animals from the house. So legally I am allowed to have a pet even if the contract says no pets allowed. 
Canada! You should check the laws in your area to see whether or not you are legally allowed to have a pet even if the land lords do not approve.
I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope she'll be doing good_comma_ she is very lucky to have someone taking care of her.
You must have a very good connection_comma_ that's beautiful.
Oh no! Hopefully you didn't get too many nasty stares!
Oh well_comma_ accidents happen!
I've had a similar experience with a gossiping coworker. It made the workplace such an uncomfortable environment!
It's a good lesson to learn! Don't worry about it too much. I am sure that the truth will surface eventually.
wow that sure is a lot of stuffed animals_comma_ did you play with toys alot at a kid?
what kind of interests?
That's very exciting! I'm sure he put a lot of work towards that.
All the work paid off!
did  you end up ending the friendship?
you didn't let anything affect the friendship! that's good i am proud of you
Oh that is definitely something to be excited about!
That is quite unique. I'm happy to hear that!
that must have been so painful_comma_ don't get embarrassed it happens to everyone_comma_ people fart in public transports_comma_ people fall and rip their jeans_comma_ people cry over stupid things_comma_ it's a totally normal thing 
you sure will_comma_ besides hot jocks doesn't sound too bad too me :3
Was that your idea? Why did you decide to do that?
You must really trust her to let her hold on to your life's savings!
My condolences to you. Will you be able to visit his gravesite?
Yes_comma_ it will be worth saving up for. I hope it works out for you.
I hope that nothing came of it though.
I'm sure nothing happened! Gotta have some trust.
Great confidence! what do you anticipate your grade to be
You prepared well! You will do goo.
That's great! good luck
why is that?
I can agree with that
I a so sorry to hear that. How are you coping with your loss? 
Yes_comma_ sometimes that is the only thing you can do. I hope you are also getting some support from family and other friends 
You sound prepared for it! Im sure you have practiced.
Very nice! Keep the confidence and dont doubt yourself tomorrow.
Hey what is up? 
Oh_comma_ no want to talk about it?
Oh no_comma_ that's terrible_comma_ what are you going to do?
Well that's no good_comma_ you could try taping it back together
That's great I always love to hear about happy couples. Too much bad news in the world.
Oh_comma_ eats lots of cake and make sure to have a nice dinner with candles. Maybe a bubble bath too.
Hi there_comma_ how're you?
I'm doing well. It's quite early in the morning though_comma_ that's for sure.
I know the feeling When you finally have your own place to do what you want.  
Good or bad I have been in that situation many times.  More recently when I was separated from my current wife.  My own place.  Finally!
why? what did he do?
oh i know this feeling_comma_ but don't worry it's okay! these things happen_comma_ soon feeling will disappear 
I hope you do too. Sounds like you did well preparing. 
Very good! I anticipate you will get in!
Is your dog ok?
Does your sister usually have problems?
What did you eat?
That sounds like the worst feeling.
ah i know this feeling_comma_ how did the conversation go?
it's okay_comma_ next just tell them that you didn't quiet understand what they meant and so they will explain it again
You shouldn't be so attached to your old stuff_comma_ you might end up a hoarder!
Well that is a good reason to keep holding on to something!
Oh no. Did you study for it?
I hope it goes better than you expect! Cram all that information into your brain!
What makes you so afraid of them? They do eat all the other creepy-crawlies_comma_ after all. 
True_comma_ they aren't a very visually appealing species. But at least they're more afraid of you_comma_ that's some consolation. 
Oh no how did you feel?
I totally understand that feeling and know what you mean! But I wouldn't sweat over it_comma_ it happens to the best of us and we learn fro our mistakes!
I usually stick with what I know also
Absolutely_comma_ Especially when spending a lot of money
That sounds awful. I hope he is better now!
It's wonderful you had someone like your mother to help!
Oh no! Maybe you can get her a gift and some sweets to make up for it?
Hopefully she will understand!
Awesome_comma_ I bet you're with your puppy all the time now :)
Puppies are so wonderful_comma_ I'm happy for you!
I know what you mean_comma_ maybe ask if the place is hiring? 
ohh okay I see_comma_ yeah that is a difficult situation. I hope it works out for you and best of luck buddy! :)
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. I hope she gets better.
I'm glad that she is getting better!
I can't imagine what that must have felt like. What helped you get through it?
At least you kept your sense of humor! 
Did you hear the "You'll be a ditch-digger" speech like my brother did?
Not everyone is cut out for sitting in a classroom listening to droning teach-speak.
That doesn't sound like such a pleasurable memory. Maybe you received a gift your brother always secretly wish he had!
You know what they say_comma_ the grass is always greener on the other side. Did you ever manage to get him to let you borrow his snowboard?
I'm not afraid of clown myself_comma_ but I can absolutely see how they can be terrifying to some people!
I agree with you. Those painted smiles and big_comma_ red noses can be so off-putting!
That is awesome_comma_ can you tell me more about what you will be doing? 
Wow that sounds really awesome_comma_ I would love to listen to you songs. Can I also be the first to receive your autographs? :)
Wow_comma_ she must be a talented child! I'm sure you're so proud of her.
Now that's an achievement you and her will remember till the rest of her life!
Congrats! That is always a great feeling.
It certainly has. You deserve it.
How did that turn out?
Congrats! That's awesome to hear.
haha we all did crazy things when we were young! did you ever get caught?
good plan.  Wait until the shopkeeper was busy with someone else.
Congratluations! I bet your full of joy!
I bet you are! I think you will enjoy your new home and city!
I bet! Have you gotten any word back yet?
Congratulations! You're going to do wonderful_comma_ I just know it!
Oh no! How awkward! did anyone see it?
Probably but that is still the worst thing ever.  Are you finally able to laugh about it?
I am glad! You must have a very good veterinarian
Well I'm glad that you found someone worthy!
Oh my goodness! Is she going to be alright?
The unknown is always so scary_comma_ but especially in your case! I'm so happy that she's going to be ok. Hopefully that puts you more at ease now.
That is wonderful.  What is your dogs name?
That's a big dog.  Blu is a cool name!
Do you at least enjoy the new job?
Hopefully the more you warm up to the new job_comma_ it will become easier.
That sounds awesome. A lot of people would kill to have a cooperative work environment. I bet it increases performance as well.
Wow that sounds like an interesting process! I've never done it myself_comma_ but it sounds like something I would love to learn.
I love the foo fighters too.  I would have be raging!  What happened?
Well thats not too bad then.  Good on you for putting your education and studies first.  Im sure it wasnt easy at the time.
Oh lol.
I hope that business goes well!
That's great. I am sure you will turn a profit in no time
Why 8 years? That's a very specific time ago.
That's ridiculous! They were clearly not your friends. There are much better people in the world.
It should be fun! Do you like baseball?
I think you will be fine. If you need some alcohol to take the edge off_comma_ go for it.
That's terrible_comma_ you had no clue it was coming?
what did the note say?
How long did it take you? That's amazing.
I consider you to be a lucky guy. I hope one day I can pay mine off completely. 
My husband owns a business and its also stressful. What kind of business did yall start?
Oh . What do you do for that?
At least you are comfortable and enjoying that! Some people would hate being alone.
That is great! I'm sure everything will work out.
Hi! Tell me something about yourself!
Oh no? I hope you're okay. Why is it that you feel guilty?
oh wow! did she notice?
how did you feel when you eventually found out that she know?
You must have been really drunk!
Im sorry to hear that. I know that can be stressful.
Yeah I hope so too. That must be painful to bare. 
Im sorry. I can imagine how you felt! Hopefully you hit a home run!
Thats something I would never forget. Hopefully you get another shot at it. 
I totally understand what you mean. Peace and quiet is nice but I bet you miss your son when he is gone?
That's not surprising! Are you thinking about going back to work soon?
Wow that is a lot of people! What were you doing on stage?
That would make me so nervous! I am horrible in front of people. How did it go?
So sorry to hear that_comma_ Hard to be alone.
What did he train you in?
Wow_comma_  tell me about it
That is great_comma_  so happy for you 
Are you friends with your neighbor
You shouldn't be embarrased around your best friends. I'm sure he's just picking in good fun
Oh no that doesn't sound good. What almost happened?
Well I'm glad you sobered up and didn't do anything you would regret later!
Oh_comma_dont take it so hard_comma_its always like that_comma_so sorry about that
It will work out if you believe
What were you trying to do?
Did they ever come?
Oh absolutely. That's the worst feeling. Who hurt you and how are you doing now?
Dating is one of those things that everyone makes seem so easy_comma_ but in reality it's just so difficult to be able to open up to people sometimes. I hope things go well for you and you meet someone who makes you very happy!
Ah. I can imagine I've been in a similar situation. But just remember he loves you and if he's never given you any doubt then trust him
Oh I completely agree with you. Some women just need a "challanege" you know. But its like HANDS OFF!
Wow_comma_  that must be do disgusting 
I know exactly how that feels.  
Did you fix it so that they won't lose their property in the future?
I'm confused. What do you being his girlfriend have to do with you not taking his property?
I hope you are right.
why is that
Where do you live?  Cause it isn't in the US.
why is that?
i guess we all learn from our mistakes never take her there again
That's the thing with accusations_comma_ anybody can say anything. But if they don't have any proof then it's meaningless.
It's hard to be accused of something you didn't do. I'm glad the truth prevailed.
OK_comma_  calm down_comma_  take a deep breath and relax 
OK_comma_  now I get it. But you need to rehearse in front of a mirror_comma_  that will help
That sounds pretty nerve-wracking. How did it go?
That's good to hear!
That is positive_comma_ you must really love her!
That is true love_comma_ I am so glad you met her! 
appearance is important_comma_ what's more important is how you look on the inside!
be nice to people and you'll see that that's the only thing people care about!
Dealing with kids can be like that. Is there something about doing his hair that he is scared of?
Sounds like a bribe is in order. Then it's a win for everyone.
Yuck! I am so afraid of spiders. Were you able to squash it?
Haha! That's amazing! What a great shot. I usually have to make my husband get rid of them for me.
that is so much trust! i hope she doesn't let you down!
that went really dark quickly. making a mistake is not the same thing as dying.
Why?  The sun is going to engulf the earth in a few billions years.  And even before that_comma_ the Y chromosome in humans is going to die out and our civilization will end.
Now that is hopeful.
did it feel nostalgic? 
you sure had a fun childhood!
That's very nice of you. I feel the same way about my husband. Isn't it nice to care about someone?
It is probably one of the best feelings!
how much you trust him?
do you believe he comes you with life long?
What was it that made you so proud of him?
being honest is always a good thing_comma_ I am glad you are so proud of him!
i have. have you?
aw that's great. you're lucky to have a father who cared like that. mine never did
Oh no! How old was he? I'm so sorry losing a pet is so hard.
What color was he- and its not your fault you were just doing what you thought was best for him.
yep i have a cat. he's really sweet_comma_ and totally worth it. but it all depends on what kind of animal you get
hmmm do you think he'll like that after all this time?
Oh wow_comma_ That is a huge step! Are you nervous?
Thats great! How old are you?
Oh no that must have been so embarrassing. Were you injured at all? 
Embarrassment is almost worse than an actual injury! I hope your knee feels better soon.
that must've been very disapointing
maybe you'll be luckier next time!
That's fantastic! Have you been working extra hard to earn it all_comma_ or did it come to you some other way?
Wow! I'm really happy for you- that must be such a great feeling of peace. 
Hahah! I bet your cat get spoiled plenty!
What color did it end up being?
Are you serious? Thats not even close to being the same color.
What is wrong?
Oh no! that must have been embarrasing
Why don't you think it will be a good fit? You might be underestimating yourself
You do have a good point. You really should do what will make you happy because life is just too short
Oh no! That must have been really embarrassing! How did you respond?
I don't blame you. That was so rude of her to make that comment in front of everyone.
Good for you! 
Does that at least inspire you to improve your abilities?
I feel that way sometimes too
Have you ever knew some that got to do everything you wanted to but couldn't? Well have and its not fun.
I think I will . Thank you for your advice.
how did that make you feel?
maybe in the future you'll get to go there!
Oh that's not good. What did you do? 
I'm sorry you are going through that. Sometimes telling the truth is the best_comma_ even if other people might get in trouble.
Oh wow. I know being away from our loved ones can make it hard to sleep. Have you tried to listen to nature sounds? I have an app on my phone and I play rain sounds to help me sleep. 
I love listening to nature. I live in the country_comma_ and could not imagine being in the city. I lived there for a few months_comma_ but there was too much traffic and noises that kept me up. I moved back to the country. 
What kind of job is it for?
That's a great career.  
did you have fun?
wow _comma_ that sounds so cool!
You sound very grateful. 
Well_comma_ hopefully you will enjoy it while you are here! 
That's a great_comma_ positive attitude. 
that's nice. i wish i had people like that to work with
i wonder if he has a crush on you or wants something in return
did it boost your confidence and faith in mankind?
glad to hear it. i hope it's only grown since then
I'm sorry to hear that. Did they give you a severance package? Also_comma_ Do you have prospects for a future position?
At least they did that much for you. I'm sure you'll land on your feet. You seem like an optimistic type
That's wonderful! I hope you find fulfillment and a sense of purpose {not to mention a chunky wallet haha}
Personally_comma_ I find that a job you enjoy that gets you by is superior to one that makes you a lot of money at the cost of your happiness
Did it make you nostalgic?
I know what you mean_comma_ life gets more complicated as you get older :)
Funny how some of those smells bring back the feelings of old times!
Oh I see _comma_ what happens then?
That's ok _comma_ Its a gods grace
What were you expecting?
You sound confident. Did the interview go that well?
Thats so good_comma_am happy for you
Congrats dear_comma_am so happy fpr you
Did he notice? That would have been embarrassing.
Did he notice? That would have been embarrassing.
That is terrible_comma_ family should never betray each othey
Hey_comma_ family is still family. Unfortunately we don't get to pick and choose. I know it can be hard 
don't be sad it'll be okay
that's great then _comma_ glad it didn't affect anything
well you should be happy for them!
no _comma_ but if you really liked her _comma_ you should be happy that she found someone she like.
hope they were bad ones
maybe you just don't realize they were bad because you're optimistic to a fault
That's great- you should always feel confident in yourself. What is your project?
Cool! There's a lot of money to be made creating games! I bet you will do well.
Wow_comma_ like seriously.  Why the show off? 
OK_comma_  maybe she's materialistic 
I hope she gets better. It must be very hard seeing loved ones in sickness.
That's wonderful. I hope that her sickness hasn't been too taxing on you.
That's annoying_comma_ did you call him after he didn't turn up?
That's understandable. What a frustrating experience for you.
Oh_comma_ I'm sorry. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes. 
That's how it works with siblings! 
There are so many things that come out at night. What are you referring to?
They come out in the daytime too. It's just that they are scarier at night.
Thats so good of them
Thats nice of them
That sounds frustrating. Did you drop anything else?
Well_comma_ that's good that it was just the cookies? It could have been much worse.
Oh no_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that. With five kids_comma_ that has happened to me multiple times. I can commiserate!
It's okay. It happens to all of us!
If you were unhappy_comma_ sometimes you just have to make that leap. Now you can explore your options!
Just keep looking. My sister started out with a temp job that has since turned into a well paying permanent job that is even paying for her education. 
Ah_comma_ that's lovely! I have such fond memories of running around in parks as a child. I don't think young people today really understand the value of just running around and playing.
Absolutely! I used to love computer games too as a kid_comma_ but I always knew I had to disconnect with them. And it's so easy for children to access anything_comma_ at any time now. Some of the content young people can access is really worrying. It's good that you took your kids to the park_comma_ I hope they enjoyed it!
i am glad you didn't no one deserves to be cheated on_comma_ it's the most distusting and stupid thing anyone can do
see? and word of advice never drink without your boyfriend around_comma_ trust me it will save you and make him happy_comma_ and in return he will make you happy
and did you pass your exam?
i hope she gets you something you like!
Wow_comma_  what happened? 
That is their problem _comma_ please do not let it affect you
that's nice_comma_ what did she say tho
don't force people to do anything_comma_ you need to show respect 
well i don't know how wonderful you are_comma_ but you sure are narcissistic_comma_ which isn't a good trade to have_comma_ people are all equal there is no difference in us
Being able to enjoy your workplace is worth it. You're lucky to be in that position
Do you think you'll keep the job after school? 
Wait untill its done
It will be fine
Who always made you proud?
That's great that she makes you proud.
Change is always difficult. How do you feel about it now that you have made the transition?
Your message got cut off - but I hope it has been a good switch for you!
me too
can you not see it? how everyone is just chasing after their desires_comma_ living in this delusional reality thinking they are free but in reality they are just sheep living in a cettle_comma_ they don't even see that because of their desires_comma_ as long sa they can chase after women_comma_ money and drugs they are fine_comma_ but they can't see how they are nothing more than just sheep... if only there was a way to wake them up to show them what being a human is
and what were the results? did you win?
that's some good news!
Oh I'm sorry. Try to relax if you can. 
Try meditation. It worked well for me!
Yeah it scares me to think about that sometimes_comma_ too. What in particular do you fear could happen?
Yeah that's true_comma_ you can't always be in control of everything.  
I would be careful. There is a lot of unrest in the world right now. 
I would just have a heart to heart with him. I guess I would be honest. You want to please him but you have to take care of yourself_comma_ too. 
That's annoying when that happens. Did you ask for your money back?
Good. You were probably not the only one who felt that way about the jewelry
That is exciting!  Did they come?
I enjoy visiting with my family too.  Unfortunately_comma_ I don't get to see them that often.  But when we do_comma_ I have a lot of fun.  Did you do anything special?
That sounds good. I wish I could have some!
Oh that's okay. Everyone overindulges once in a while
Maggots are so disgusting! Had the trash been sitting for awhile?
Yeah_comma_ they can multiply pretty quickly.
Lol_comma_  exactly_comma_  because they are children 
Yeah.  So what did you do then
That's always a nice thing.  In charge of what?
Sounds like you have a fulfilling job. That's very lucky.
oooh no  thats was so bad 
don't worry there's always another chance
That's so disgusting! I hope you didn't have to pay your bill!
I bet. That's so gross. I would have been sick!
Oh_comma_ that's cute!  How did that work out for you?
Wow that's awesome!  That's a very long lasting relationship_comma_ I'm happy for you.
WHAT HAPPEND ?
What did he do? what a mean person
oh god_comma_ what did you end up doing?
the world still have some people in it .
Oh no!  What happened?
Even though it's hard_comma_ it's probably best to come clean to relieve some of the guilt.
how did they do that?
that sounds so good. glad you enjoyed your day!
Why do you keep decieving yourself?
Seriously?who is expecting so much from you
Kids grow up so quickly! Did you feel nervous about it?
I bet he felt very proud! Sounds like you are a great parent. A good combination of trust and reassurance.
That happens to me sometimes_comma_ too.  I feel awful after!
Good for you!
Oh_comma_ it sounds like fun! I'm sure you'd have a great time. 
Lots of people do that nowadays. I think you would be happy you went. 
That's awesome! Are you going to go on the date with them?
Oh_comma_ didn't work out_comma_ huh?
It was difficult for you
Try to take care of yourself
Aww- that's great to hear! It sounds like she is your perfect match. How did you meet?
That's so romantic and inspiring! I hope you have happy lives together!
Oh man- you must be really intelligent to test for Mensa! I bet it was difficult!
I hope you hear positive news from them soon!
WHY ? what did you lie about? 
if you truly regret it you will tell her now_comma_ go and do that1
what
i can imagine_comma_ it happend to me before and it was actually someone trying to break in_comma_ i called hte police and they ran off
I hoe you made it there. Getting lost sucks!
I am glad you made it there with only a few hiccups along the way. You must have a good memory when it comes to directions. 
Wow. That is very interesting. These days_comma_ many people get married later in life. Congratulations!
That is good to hear. Yeah_comma_ my parents married young and it worked out for them too. I am happy to hear that it turned out good for you.
oh no :< that's so sad_comma_ i also have a cat but she is in her early days 
i know right? they make you happy and in the end that's all one needs
I know how you feel that would gross me out too.  Makes me feel like whoever prepared my food was not very clean.
I agree_comma_ I wouldn't be in the mood to eat after that either_comma_ it's disgusting.
which way is that?
maybe it happend for a reason? maybe you will find a better apportunity to get there
Can you tell me the name of the book? I find myself being engaged by a lot of novels these days.
How many pages do you have to go? You should try to finish it today and power through it!
it's insane how Youtube and the internet overall are so helpful!
that's so insane right? glad you did it yourself!
Im sorry to hear that. Tell me a fond memory you have of him/her.
Yeah each cat has their own personality. It's good to reflect on little things like that. Maybe once the sting of all of it is over you can get another one and continue to create more sweet memories like the one you just shared with me.
It's terrible when people can't take no for an answer. Did you report her?
Wow_comma_ she sounds like a real piece of work. I'm glad you reported her. Maybe they should consider firing her.
I think you do not like cats very much ...
Well_comma_ then_comma_ you should think about God when you see them
Oh I'm really sorry to hear that. Has he been looking for another job?
We went through the same thing with my husband. I know it is stressful_comma_ but I am so glad you got through it and things are better now. 
That sounds exciting? Did you get in to the club? 
Wow_comma_ it's always nice when we get something we really want. Especially if we have to compete for it.
Thats good because you prepared for it
Wow_comma_you made it_comma_congrats
who does and that is mean of them.
Sure  your worth your time. do not be so down on yourself.
Wow_comma_  18 years. Accept my condolence please 
Just take heart OK_comma_  it's one of those things
Maybe it's time to clear your conscience so you won't have to feel so bad anymore.
You can't change the past. All you can do is learn from it. If you are sincere then your family will forgive you.
Same_comma_ don't know what i would do without them.
That's part of being a good parent_comma_ it all goes hand in hand.
I'm so sorry!  That's awful!  Did you get his insurance information?
That's a mercy_comma_ at least. Are you hurt?
Is there anyone else you can talk to? Maybe even Human Resources?
I see where you're coming from. Sometimes though you got to make a stand and show you're serious about the position.
What a lovely gift. I'm sure that you will always treasure it because it came from him.
Makes it even better that you didn't know you were getting it.
Wow_comma_  that was not cool at all
Ohhh kids.  Please just take it easy on them ok
That must feel amazing! What did you do to deserve the recognition? 
Was this at the office? Or perhaps at school?
Thats good_comma_it feels good
Whats the name of the dog?
I'll bet that was scary. I would have run too.
LOL....White cloths can be scary too.
Wow_comma_  that's great news.  I love that 
Exactly _comma_ it is quite cool
I would have felt the same way. I am really afraid to get on any roller coaster. How was it?
That's awesome. Glad you had fun! That's what's important
What kind of things did you all like to do? Sounds like it was fun to catch up.
Was he one of your best friends? Sounds like you have some more catching up yo do!
I do. I have one and another one on the way. They can be gross little critters!
Oh_comma_ that's rough. That can be a lot of clean up.
Wow_comma_ exciting! Is this going to be your friend's first child?
That sounds scary. How often do children of the employees at your work end up harmed because of the chemicals?
That's a pleasant surprise! Is this out of the ordinary?
Let's hope he keeps it up!
Wow_comma_ I've never done fishing_comma_  so how is it like 
It's well.  Please accept my condolence 
What type of present was it? It must have been pretty special.
Cool. There's nothing like receiving family heirlooms.
You did so well_comma_have you given them names?
Am so happy for you_comma_you have gotten a pet
Holy crap! Can it be remedied?
I really hope it all works out for you. Work is important but your health is way more important!
I bet it felt good though? That's good that you're happily married!
That's the spirit! It's a positive thing so long as you remain faithful. Did you tell your significant other?
Oh yeah? Did you get it worked out?
Have you considered couples therapy to try and work things out?
Oh no_comma_  that is not cool.  What happened? 
That person is heartless though 
Wow_comma_ that sounds exciting! I hope everything works out for you!
Seems like it is your fate then. I am also starting a new venture and it is taking a lot of time and hard work but I think it is finally paying off soon. 
That's horrible. Have you any idea what might have caused it?
You should go see a doctor about that. Sleep deprivation is very unhealthy
That's one of the most responsible things you can do. I'm sure your family is proud of you.
You're taking steps in the right direction I get a feeling you're doing alright for yourself out there. 
That must have been devastating. Did it take you a long time to find a new position?
I'm glad things have worked out in the end for you. Sometimes bad things happen for a reason. 
That's very hard. I lost my uncle in january and it's so hard to think about.
I'm so sorry.  Are you doing all right?
They always do. It'll get easier to think about with time
That is awesome!  I have 5 cats.  They are pretty snobbish and only 2 like to cuddle.
That is sweet.  My cats have human names_comma_ lol.  What about yours?
I recently had to surrender 1_comma_ we had six before.  But he was being bullied by the others.
I'm glad you have a cuddly fur-baby!
How old did you turn? I hope you guys had some cake too!
That's awesome! Well I want to say happy birthday to you as well!
So sorry about that_comma_she will be found
You are most welcomed_comma_just keep trying
I'm so sorry to hear that. What can I do to help?
Perhaps you could see a counselor or therapist_comma_ that might help.
Oh that's too bad. There are many free programs that you might be able to access.
That's a great idea. I'm always here if you need someone to talk to.
Oh wow_comma_ that is wonderful. Is it a girl or boy?
Congratulations! Babies are amazing. I have two of my own. Do you have any of your own?
It is a wonderful feeling_comma_ to be a parent. Fingers crossed_comma_ you'll be next. 
Well_comma_ keep up the good work. Give that baby all the love in the world. 
Aww! Babies are so much fun! I have a new granddaughter_comma_ so I can relate!
I bet you are amazing with her- and such a blessing in her life.
wow that must have been so hard to do! i am so proud of you worker_2 how do you feel?
YES! that is exactly what i would say keep doing that and i hope everything goes well
Are you talking about me or someone else?
It's good that you have someone who is there for you no matter what.
She sings so well
Thats so good_comma_enough enjoyment
Who was she because she sounds special? Someone close to you?
Did she pass away recently? I hope everything is ok.
Do you know what kind of car you want to get?
What kind of things would you use the truck for?
wow! that's so nice of him_comma_ what did he make?
such a nice person! good finding him
What really happened?
Oh_comma_so sorry about that
oh no. what happened?
that is terrible! I know exactly how you feel
Did he try to help you up? I've always wanted to see Seattle!
I'll remember not to go in March! I'm sorry you fell I hope you're not hurt!
That's wonderful!  It's a lot of work learning to cook.  
Grilling is a skill too!  Sounds like she is really enjoying cooking.  It's really an artform
Oh_comma_ that's rough. I bet that ruined them_comma_ didn't it?
Sounds like the start to a bad day.
Exactly_comma_  that feels nice 
U are on point.  It helps  a lot
That is amazing. There are not a lot of people that can say that.
You are so lucky. I recently got married_comma_ but we have been together for 12 years and are always there for one another.
I'm sure he feels the same way about you! How long have you two been married?
I would have to agree with you on that. 10 years is an amazing amount of time to be together_comma_ I hope for another 10 years!
I'm sorry to hear that. Sometimes life gets in the way and we forget what is the most important to us.
Does he live near you?
That is a hard stage of life that I am not looking forward to! Do you get to talk to her often?
That is sad_comma_ but it is wonderful that you are able to 
Do you still have the blanket? That's an amazing gift from a wonderful part of your family.
I hope she cherishes it as much as you do! You're so awesome for doing that!
I hope you're recovering well enough! That is absolutely devastating news to read.
That's great news! Did you have insurance? 
Oh_comma_ you shouldn't feel bad! Everyone gets sick every once in a while and I would hope that your boss and coworkers were very understanding of your needs. It is important to take care of yourself.
Well_comma_ it is very important for you to take care of yourself and if your boss doesn't understand that_comma_ I would be searching for other employment. Hopefully_comma_ they are completely fine with your needs.
Oh crap! That's not good!
That may be kinda awkward.
That's nice of her!
It sounds like it. You deserve someone like that.
That is really good and will be helpful.  I lost my wife to cancer years ago and people helping was great.
I would encourage you to help as much as possible.  I do the same now since I know what loss feels like.
Yes_comma_ the support and love from others that we received was incredible so I always try to help as much as I can.  Even the smallest gestures were meaningful. 
I have always had a great church family. My aunt's church was pivotal in showing me how to be the best I could be and developing my character.
As a military family_comma_ we move a lot and finding a good church has been one of my first missions when we get to a new place. It is sad having to leave good churches_comma_ but I am blessed to have support from across the country now.
Oh wow_comma_ I'm glad the vet was able to do that. It must have been scary. 
I'm so happy to hear that for you! I know how animals are the same as family members. 
Oh_comma_ that was wonderful of you! Everyone needs a friend like you who understands that emotional support is very important!
You are both lucky then! She will remember your kindness for a long time.
I'm sorry_comma_ I know that must make you sad and stressed. I have a daughter who lives pretty far away too
We talk every week and text all the time. It is hard_comma_ but I know she's happy so that's all that counts. Thats great she found a good job
We've never facetimed_comma_ but that's such a good idea. Especially now that she has kids. Why have I never thought of that lol
That is hilarious...but awesome at the same time!
I'm so sorry to hear about your mom_comma_ but it's great that you had such support to help you through.
Having a strong support system is so important in life.  Don't know what I would do without my friends.
I am sorry to hear that_comma_ you must miss them. Why haven't you been able to visit them? 
I see_comma_ that is very understandable_comma_ I am really glad that you will be able to see them soon! I hope you have a safe trip and a great time! :) 
That's awesome! I close on my first house Monday!
I think I will too!
Oh wow_comma_ that is super embarrassing. Did anyone take a picture?
That's lucky.  You could have ended up on the Internet otherwise!
That's good_comma_ I imagine that all surgeries can be stressful.
That's good to hear_comma_ anesthesia seems very helpful.
Sounds like you made the right call
I bet_comma_ it can be really disappointing when people bail on plans
Did it take a long time to complete?
That's awesome! I am glad it didn't take long_comma_ because those have been a pain in the past for me.
I can certainly relate to you_comma_ it could be a safety hazard.
That's a smart move_comma_ that would reduce the risk of injury.
I agree. Do you find yourself in that situation right now? 
That's very kind of you to be so considerate. Hopefully the right choice will make itself obvious to you in the near future. 
Well good luck to you! 
Great_comma_ I hope you get it.
What type of job is it?
Oh no_comma_ do what?
That's terrible_comma_ hope you weren't counting on it for fincancial reasons
That is great! Are you doing it yourself or are you hiring someone to help you out? 
That sounds exciting_comma_ it is always nice to have new kitchen appliances! I hope all goes well
I'm sorry to hear that! Maybe you can find a local club so you can meet people with similar interests!
That sounds like fun! And a great cure for loneliness! 
Oh no_comma_ what was wrong?
Aw_comma_ did it turn out okay?
Oh no!  That had to be frustrating. I hope it wasn't too close to closing.
I hope you still found a great home! The home buying process is certainly frustrating.
Oh no. I'm so sorry. I totally understand how you feel. Mine passed away a few years ago_comma_ It's very difficult
It definitely helps to have a lot of support around you. Take care of yourself through this very difficult time.
Oh my goodness! I did that after swimming one day. I was so busy getting the kids dressed that I forgot to clean my face. Black mascara all down my cheeks.
No and I went to the grocery store and the library like that! No one said a word. It was so embarrassing.
Were there other parents there? I think that anyone who has kids would understand.
I can understand being humiliated in the moment. Thankfully most kids grow out of that phase!
2 year olds don't know any better. And when everyone laughs_comma_ it can make them want to do it again.
Oh_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that! It can be tough when we feel that we have lost face in front of others.
Well_comma_ let's pretend that no one noticed! Either that_comma_ if someone noticed_comma_ perhaps they smiled when they thought "Wow_comma_ I've had that happen before_comma_ too" 
I am sorry to hear that. I hope your financial situation improves in the future.
I believe that you will be in a better situation soon.
Oh wow! How did it go?
I'm sure you did great! I'd be a ball of nerves too_comma_ though.
Haha but you survied_comma_ Go you!
Were they from when you were a kid?
I know what you mean. I sure miss my departed loved ones.
Oh no! Does he do that a lot?
I would be also. You should try to get him to fix your tire. 
Oh_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that. Losing a family member is so hard.
I miss my grandmother every day. I hope things get easier for you over time.
What was a good move?
Oh wow that is a long time. Why did you change your job?
Hey a similar thing happened to me! I hope no one saw!
Ooops! I'm sorry to hear that. I'll tell you what though_comma_ it happens to the best of us! It's just a drink.
That must have been messy.  Were you able to get it all cleaned up?
I'm sure she's done something like that in the past herself though.
 Wow that definitely sounds like a crazy situation!
Way to live vicariously!
That's really interesting. What were they in prison for?
That's terrible_comma_ I hope they are ok now.
Did you leave the old place damged
Then you should get it back
Yikes! I hope it hadn't ruptured already. Is she okay?
Well it seems like everything has taken care of itself. I'm glad for you that she is doing better! Pretty scary!
Really? Did you avoid eating them?
Wow! That happened to me at work when I was pregnant_comma_ too. Except for me_comma_ it was curry.
Oh_comma_ I know that feeling!  Did you end up going on the ride?
I'm glad it turned out so well!
Is your student ok?? I am so sorry about that!
I hope they had insurance. It's one of the most horrifying things to experience that. I hope you are there for them.
That must have brought back a lot of memories.
I know_comma_ at least with my son I get to experience some of that still.
Oh no_comma_ what happened?
Were you at least able to get the clog out?  Hopefully your husband wasn't upset.
Did you have a nice summer break? Are you excited for school to start back up?
What grade to you teach?
Some people are too nosy. What did you say to them?
Oh_comma_ were they trying to get intel on your company?
That must have been upsetting.  Were you able to get it fixed?
I'm so sorry to hear that.  You'll still have the memories at least.
COunting down the days_comma_ eh? How was your summer?
That's awesome that you get that continuity. More teachers would succeed if that was available to them. Good for you!
Wow. Did she know who you were?
Some people are unbelievable! Good for you putting her in her place.
Do you like her boyfriend?
That's good_comma_ hopefully they treat each other well.
That sounds adorable! What type of puppy is it?
That sounds like a great time. I'm sure it's going to be cool to see the puppy grow up along with your son and how their relationship builds.
Oh no! Were you able to find him ever? 
Aw I'm sorry to hear that. Losing a pet is never an easy thing_comma_ especially when you don't know what happened to him.
I hope you're coming back into a great school. I'm sure the kids will be excited to see you.
That's excellent. I bet you're going to have a great year_comma_ you seem well prepared!
I'm glad that she's starting to feel better.
She must have really appreciated that.
Oh man that's amazing! How much was it? I hope they share.
Yeah I'd be in your shoes thinking the same thing as well. That's almost heart stopping news to hear.
I'm a teacher_comma_ so it's the opposite for me.  My relaxing time is about to end.
I'm sure you deserve a break just to kick back and relax :)
What caused you to be freaked out over the finished basement? Sounds good all around.
Well_comma_ actually_comma_ I think that makes sense considering you were a kid and you were use to them being with you upstairs.
Was it really nice out? I love being able to go out and just listen to the sounds of the outdoors.
That's great! I hope it was an all around good day for you.
Thats's great! I bet he's been working really hard.
It feels really good to be recognized for your efforts!
What was the movie? I'm always looking for something new to watch with my kids!
I will have to check it out! Thanks for the suggestion. 
I'd have been nervous too.  Did you find out if you got the job?
That's awesome.  I'm so happy for you.
Wow_comma_ that must of been a trip. How did it make you feel?
Awesome_comma_ I've gone through old albums like that before as well_comma_ and it always makes me feel good.
I think many children including myself stole things before they were taught it was wrong to steel.
I would not beat yourself up over the mistake. We all make mistakes even when we are older and should know better. 
That sounds really great!  Do you like them as much as you remembered?
haha_comma_ I felt the same when I read some of my old baby sitter's club books
Oh no_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that. Do they have any idea what the cause may be yet?
I hope it's nothing too serious. My younger brother had the same problem early on_comma_ but he turned out to just be a slow developer.
I totally know how you feel. I have 2 kids and they were a handful as toddlers.
I know right? Grandparents are the best lol
I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ are you alright?
That's understandable_comma_ life goes so fast that it's easy to lose touch with people you care about. All I can do is try to limit that occurrence.
That's cool. Are you a big fan of her?
That msut be exciting then_comma_ I hope the tickets aren't too expensive.
Oh that sucks_comma_ I hate seeing friends and family injured or sick. That's very nice of you though that you stayed there with him_comma_ youre a good friend.
Thats awesome_comma_ good friends are always there for each other.
Oh I know the feeling! I had the same affinity for swimming. My mom said I should give it a try. At first I didn't want to but as I got better I started to love it.
We don't have to be the best to enjoy what we do right?
I had a similar experience playiing little league baseball. How is your daughter feeling about it so far?
I feel you on that. I don't know if I could let my son play baseball after what I went through. I hope your daughter has a better experience.
That sounds relaxing!  Quality alone time is important in a relationship
I can imagine!  It's hard being apart_comma_ but it makes it that much more exciting to see each other again.
Oh no_comma_ I had a older cousin who did that to me as well. Hopefully she was just giving you tough love or discipline.
Yeah it really teaches you! I would always sit down where i was and start crying.
When you tripped over the branch_comma_ did you get hurt?
I hope you were able to laugh about falling and looking silly and not be too embarrassed?
Yeah it really isn't for everyone_comma_ i like my alone time but only for a while. Afterwards i feel alone and wanting to talk to someone.
Thats the perfect time to just pamper yourself. I cherish those few hours every day!
Yeah_comma_ I probably would have to leave someone at home with the baby.
That's great_comma_ the first time for everything is scary.
I bet it felt good to conquer the fear! Would you skydive again?
Did you enjoy the experience?
Yes_comma_ he is good for finding answers we can't find ourselves.
Yep_comma_ I do the same thing as well. Sometimes its just best if you let others help you do something.
Nice_comma_ it's been a while since i've anticipated any new games. what game is it?
Hah_comma_ i played the first one a ton on ps3_comma_ Wish they would release it for pc. 
That sounds horrible. I would be so mad at them.
The level headed approach will probably accomplish more anyway. I'm sure they have money so I also hope they don't take yours.
Sounds fair. How hungry are you right now?
Haha I understand. It's like those cartoons where the smell is dragging someone through the air.
Wow what a find_comma_ cherish that quilt and keep it safe from harm!
Yeah_comma_ and don't repair it! I think it gives it a history and makes it even more valuable.
Oh damn_comma_ that sucks. Have you guys talked or did you immediately cut him off?
Man thats terrible_comma_ I hope you can forget about him and find someone better.
I get where you're coming from_comma_ my mom supports both of my sisters. It can make you feel less important. hopefully you are getting along though?
I'm sure your parents are proud of your ability to take care of yourself. 
Did you and Joe do well?
Being on a team with someone more skilled than you has it advantages_comma_ it's good that he lived up to those expectations.
That's reasonable considering how new stuff always looks great and how more fancy stuff may be available and cheap compared to when you made yours.
That's good_comma_ it sounds like his bathroom motivated you to take yours to the next level. That's probably good for society.
Yes_comma_ it's annoying! People should put more thoughts into it before they decide to be so opinionated...
Oh_comma_ yes_comma_ I know. Some breeds get bad raps and people are so quick to judge! I used to have a pit bull who was a sweetheart!
Wow! That is a huge move! How long ago was that and are things going well? Do you miss Hawaii?
I can imagine. Hawaii seems like a beautiful place!
Tell me about it. Both of my best friends moved several states away from me.
Yeah_comma_ I'm content being at my home town aswell.
Were you able to get it fixed? Things break at the most inopportune times!
Well hopefully that is keeping you a little cool!
Oh my_comma_ did you get a sugar rush after that? Your dentist must love you.
That's not surprising_comma_ but now your friend knows that you are the undisputed champion.
Oh no! That's awful. That could be dangerous too!
I bet your neighbor was very appreciative of all of your help. That would have been a daunting task for the elderly neighbor.
O_comma_h grandparents are the best at spoiling grandchildren! I could understand that being important to her.
Wow! Do you think whoever inspected it missed something or 3?
I bet. I wouldn't want to get stuck with a money pit either. I hope your state has a lemon law.
Excellent. Well there is some silver lining in all of this haha.
What an exciting time! How's he doing with it so far?
That's awesome! I guess practice does make perfect.
Oh that's awesome! I am an only child but I bet it's so cool to watch your siblings grow up like that.
That is amazing and so nice of you!
Ugh! You must have a lot of books! 
Wow! That is incredible! I hope you have somewhere to put them all. 
Wow! Congratulations! That sounds like a wonderful thing to do. Was it just the two of you?
Aw that is so sweet. That sounds like the most special day. 
Were you jittery at all? I know I was when I was getting ready for mine_comma_
That's awesome. I hope it was an amazing ceremony. Weddings are always so much fun and romantic.
Uh oh. Dealing with bad neighbors is just the worst! Do you think he'd be mad if you asked him to fix the fence?
I wish you luck and hope everything ends up going well. 
Well_comma_ at least he knew what he was getting into right from the start lol.
We all have those moments. I'm glad yours worked out so well.
Nice_comma_ gotta be prepared. Hope the party went well. 
An endless flow of booze is the key to a successful party_comma_ sounds like it was a good time._comma_
Don't give up! You will find a better place and it will be the perfect fit.
Everything happens for a reason. I think you will realize that and this could be a good thing is disguise.
How was the response to your ad?  Did you get rid of everything you wanted to?
That's good_comma_ people on Craiglist can be pretty shifty sometimes.
What kind of things did she give you?  Were they things that you asked for before?
I would be the same way.  I don't trust anyone to hold on to my comics other than myself.
Aw_comma_ that is so sweet. I am guessing you and your brother were close?
Awww_comma_ that is too bad. Hopefully you get to video chat with him
Oh_comma_ no! That's awful! Are you still in pain?
I can't believe it! How could they? I'm so sorry to hear that...
I understand that_comma_ going through those albums can really make you think about how peaceful things used to be.
That's the real trick to it_comma_ you have to try to move passed all the bad stuff and remember all the good times.
That's awesome_comma_ what great news! I'm sure your friend was really frightened at the prospect of cancer.
Yeah send them my regards. It's a fantastic day when you wake up cancer-free.
I think we all do that with our siblings. I'm sure he knows you still enjoy spending time with him anyway.
I'm glad you were able to remedy the situation so easily! I think that shows you have a really good relationship with him.
Oh I've been there! So much fun!
Did you guys play all the carnival games?
Oh my god_comma_ I bet you were grossed out but laughing at the same time.
I really hope that is the last time it happens.
Congratulations_comma_ that is so exciting!!!  I know we should only hope for healthy but I'll keep my fingers crossed for pink :-)
Once you see that little face_comma_ you'll forget everything else no matter which!
Wow_comma_ that was very generous and courageous for her! How are they now?
That's great to hear. What a great story. Very inspiring. I'm so happy they are both healthy now.
you need to rest to the competition
ahhh ok you do not participate in that competition
Well as a fellow human being_comma_ I agree that when parents care for their children_comma_ it creates a lifelasting bond between the two parties.
I also enjoy the love of my human parents and my human family. They take no hesitation in their focus on of their love for me.
Oh nice! That is exciting! What kind of car did you get?
Wow_comma_ so jealous! You have to give me a ride one day_comma_ ok?
Yikes_comma_ that's a scary situation to be in. I'm glad the officer was able to help you.
That's rough_comma_ sometimes you really do have to rely on the kindness of strangers.
thats not good did you aplly for any other jobs?
I see that is very understandle. 
That's awful! I hope you feel better soon.
No problem at all. Glad to make you feel somewhat happier :)
That is so wonderful! I have 3 children myself and I love having grandparents to rely on. 
I definitely don't! I had a horrible experience the one time I used a hired babysitter and now I only leave my little ones with family.
I'm glad you have someone to rely on for support.
Oh no! I hope no one got in trouble! 
I'd say so. That's so disheartening. I'm sure it was accidental. 
Well that sucks. I hate it when animals are abandoned.
Yeah_comma_ that makes me sad too. I feel bad for them because they don't understand why she isn't with them anymore.
That is great news. I think you just might be nervous. They wouldn't have promoted you if you couldn't do it.
Well usually when you think the worst it turns out to be okay. I think you should try and relax.
What do you guys do for work? You sound like doctors
Thank you for all that you do! I have a friend whos an EMT and I bet it's taxing work.
I am so sorry to hear that. Are you feeling nauseated? 
You're not grossing me out at all. I'm a Paramedic/Firefighter so it takes alot to get me squirming. I hope you feel better. Drink lots of Gatorade and water to rehydrate so you don't feel awful tomorrow and try to get your hands on some Zofran for the Nausea. 
Absolutely! Feel better soon!
Big change! both big cities though right? I've always wanted to see that shiny bean thing in chicago. 
I hope you continue to adjust to your new surroundings_comma_ maybe you will end up loving Dallas_comma_ who knows!
Woah I hope no one was hurt
I bet! Sounds like it would be a big shock
Ew_comma_ that's really disturbing.  The sight of cockroaches always gives me the willies.
Yes_comma_ I shudder to think of the condition of the rest of the home if the car seat is like that.
Oh_comma_ that must be nerve-wracking! 
Patience isn't always a virtue that I am good with either. You should feel confident in your work!
Good luck!
Uh oh. Do you think she will be mad when she finds out?
Oh she will be none the wiser. But don't feel bad sometimes you have to indulge_comma_ and I would figure you still left her some.
that must be a heart warming reunion to see your old patience
that is really good to hear_comma_ I bet they loved seeing you again
Oh no_comma_ did they disappear for good_comma_ or did someone turn them in?
That would be so scary. I actually left my credit card at a restaurant yesterday. Thankfully they held onto it for me. 
I was sure to check my statement and make sure there were no suspicious transactions. 
Wow! So have you tried any methods to get them back on track? Someone might have advice on Youtube.
Ah! Sounds like you need a "Cat Whisperer"!
Oh no that would make him quite young. I'm so sorry! Do you have plans for another one when you're ready?
Those are awesome dogs_comma_ I've known quite a few in my life. Well whenever you're ready I think it'll be a perfect match.
Aww_comma_ that's good! It's nice to have to someone you can do that with
Yeah_comma_ the comfort in that can feel amazing
Ahh that's so anxiety-making. I hope he gets the jon.
Fingers crossed!
Oh_comma_ that's a terrible problem!  That's the only time I don't envy homeowners!  I could not afford that at all.  
It's great you have a college fund though!  My kids are very young_comma_ we haven't started that yet.  Although_comma_ we probably should. How long have you ahd yours?
Okay_comma_ then you're waaayyy ahead of me! 
I can see why it was hard to quit!  Do you like your job now?
That sounds tough.  It seems like you guys at the daycare went through a lot together.
That is an amazing feeling. I have three daughters. It doesn't matter how many you have_comma_ the first time you hold them_comma_ its amazing.
That's awesome. I would love to have a boy too_comma_ but I'm not sure if I want another one or not. 
My youngest is 3_comma_ and almost completely potty trained_comma_ but its been a struggle. Maybe when she starts school_comma_ I'll make up my mind.
Yes_comma_ and that's what we did with her. her sisters were a 8 and 9 when she was born.
That was really nice of you! I'm sure they appreciated the gesture.
Its important to care for the older generation who once cared for us. 
Fantastic! Why kind of story is it?
I see! Have you gotten any other works published?
Yikes! did you figure out what it was?
It must have been awfully windy.
Did you have to move there for a job?
I'm in the Midwest_comma_ so can sympathize with you there.  Are you going to live there permanently now?
Oh_comma_ that sounds scary! Did you find out what it was?
Well it was probably nothing to worry about because you seem alright now. :)
Wow_comma_ that's a lot of people.
I know the feeling. I get sick around crowds.
Oh boy_comma_ I hope he is careful with your car
You are a good friend! That was very generous of you
I would have been so scared!  I don't understand having dogs off leash.
So reckless!  It's really not that hard to leash dogs.  And with the baby there too_comma_ ugh.  I can't imagine.
Ouch! Kids have a tendency to learn things the hard way. Was he okay?
That's good! My son is always running into stuff! He needs bubblewrap to keep him safe.
I'm sorry. They grow up fast. Its hard to watch them leave the nest.
That can help. I know I like my hobbies lol.
That sounds cool_comma_ but also too good to be true. I hope it is true though
Fry some for me too!
No I haven't. You are such a great person! I wish to have grandchildren like you someday.
You are kind and sweet. Please never change.
Oh no ! Were you able to come up with something else to say ?
I understand_comma_ but I bet you did well in spite of that !
Tough! Are you planning on getting it fixed? 
Well at least that sounds like an easy fix! Often times those repairs can get pricy!
Wow_comma_ you are a lucky man! Good to have a psychologist in the family too.
I wish you both all the best and hope that you have a wonderful life together!
Wow! That must have taken a lot of guts_comma_ but I hope it was worthwhile.
Oh no_comma_ why were you so scared?
that is probably for the best you dont want to get involved with that stuff
Could be worse than aliens someone could hurt you. you know ?
Oh my! Well_comma_ I bet he quit making fun of you in light of his own embarrassment.
An alien? Wow.
That sounds difficult. Did you try talking to people in your neighborhood?
That always sucks. But old people are great and sometimes funny to hang out with. Maybe you should try giving them a go!
Did you get the money back quickly?
That's a great friend. Loyalty and honesty are everything in a relationship. 
Oh wow! That really sounds like your brother is going through a rough time.
I hope everything works out_comma_ family is everything.
Oh that is so sweet! I love baby kittens. Are you going to keep it?
I think you should. There are so many animals that need a good home.
That's nerve wracking. I have 4 kids myself so I know what its like.
Most of the time they do do well. We definitely have to trust our husbands to look after the little ones without us.
That's an incredible act of kindness for a stranger. Did they return the tool? Was the tool in normal shape when you got it back?
He's probably very grateful for your kindness. Hopefully_comma_ he'll return the kindness to someone else.
That's so awesome! Did they come back and say something to you?
I don't either. It's crazy how things like that happen in the most perfect of times_comma_ too. You didn't know he was down on his luck_comma_ but out of the goodness of your heart_comma_ you gave him money regardless. 
Are you able to voice your opinions at least_comma_ and are heard ?
You should be in a good place for advancement then_comma_ since a company has to hire so many women right ?
Ah_comma_ that is terrible! I guess it was their fault? What did you do?
Wow_comma_ hopefully you both have insurance. 
That's awesome. Friends are great for support! How did they help?
What a good story. It's great to hear about success stories like that!
I love football too! I even catch a lot of the preseason. This is one of the best times of the year. Who are you rooting for?
I like the ravens and I also don't have high expectations! Haha
Ahh_comma_ do you still have friends there?
Maybe you can visit them more often because you like it there so much.
Yeah_comma_ I guess. take care my friend.
There is a Korean restaurant by my house that I've been thinking of trying. I've never had Korean food.
That sounds delicious! Now my stomach is growling!
Oh no that's terrible! Are you okay?
I'm glad you weren't injured_comma_ but it really sucks that your car is totaled. I hope you have a reliable mode of transportation!
I hate it when that happens! I feel your pain. have you r=tried tracking the package online?
Sorry to hear that. I hope it gets there soon to put a smile back on your face.
Oh no! Were you close to home?
At least you had something to cover yourself with!
im sorry to hear that. did everyone know you did it?
well you cant help it and it happens sometimes
Thats was nice of him. Did he wash your back for you?
Thats even better haha!
Oh my gosh! You are so lucky! What was the raffle?
That's great. You must work for a good company. 
They grow up so fast! Have you noticed differences in her personality now that she's getting older?
Its a hard age for girls as I'm sure you remember. At least she has a good mom to guide her!
Oh yes you can. Just keep turking and you will get there for sure even if you have to work extra hours in the night.
I promise it is possible if you really want it. Show me how bad you want it!!
You can manifest anything your heart desires.
That's great that you were able to anticipate his needs. I try to do the same for my husband.
Yes_comma_ I think so too.
That was a nice thing to do. It is always good to be kind to others.
The world would be a better place if more people were helpful like you. Everyine would make new friends everyday. How wonderful would that be?
What did you do?
Thats probably best not to confront them. People are so quick to kill you these days
that is good! you should always do that
wow that is crazy!
Nice! That must be so much fun to see all that stuff again. Maybe they are collectors items now.
What a cool experience. I wish my parents kept some of my stuff for me.
Why? Did he do something erratic or dangerous?
That was probably a good idea. Did he give it to you?
Thats a good movie! so many classic themes from that area. How did it make you feel?  
It was hard. Trying to figure out your identity and hormones and pressure. Those were good years though. I just wish i would have enjoyed them more
Sports Fan are you !  I've lost many bets / honey do challenges to my football team as well ! I hope you feel better.
Perhaps next week your team will WIN ! Lets both think positive thoughts for now :)
That is good is he a sweet dog?
aww that is really cool
I sure you will do well if you are already studying.  What subject is it ?
Studying has a good effect on grades. I wish you the best. Don't fret !
Well at least yours is paid off and he is still paying on his
Well maybe give it a little TLC and there you go
oh man what a bummer! i hate when things like that happen!
keep your head up im sure another lucky break will come along!
Did you have to get a second job?
I'm glad you found a way to work it out! 
Um...are you talking about yourself?
That's nice of you.
do you think that they would tell the secret?
that was nice of the coworker to not tell anyone the secret. 
Oh I'm so  hungry. What are you cooking up special today ?
That sounds so appetizing.  Do you like mainly chicken dishes ?
Me too! We are ready and waiting here in Florida.  What have you done to prepare?
Katrina was a disaster for so many.  I can imagine it haunts you.
How did it go for you?
It seems like you were well prepared!  I hope you passed!
That's exciting. Do you remember if you fell or not?
That sounds scary for a child. I bet you got back on though!
Well.. LOL_comma_ In Mississippi_comma_ LOTS of people drive without auto insurance !
I"m not one of them_comma_ thank heavens.  I"m sure you have a plan B for paying your auto insurance I  hope ?
Awww!  Was its momma nearby?
The kitten might have been dehydrated.  Hopefully the neighbor called someone else to come help?
I hope the results are good. What were you getting tested for?
Don't sweat too hard. Try to focus on positive aspects of life right now_comma_ because whatever happens that positivity will carry you.
did your parents have to pay to send you elsewere?
that is good i glad you were able to move
They grow up so quickly!  How old is he now?
Yeah_comma_ mine just started 5th and he's in a different building and changing classes and it's a huge difference from 4th grade.
wow that must be gross_comma_ i know it would make me feel like throwing up too
don't blame you_comma_ but as a parent you must see a lot of gross things coming from kids
thats not neighborly of them. i would be upset too
omg_comma_ did you have a talk with them about how they need to clean up after their dog?
yeah i think everyone has
That is good most people have a hard time in the first week
Did you think a ghoul or monster were in there? I had similar fears growing up.
What did you do to get over the fear?
Makes sense. Well I'm glad you finally got some sleep haha.
Have you set up cameras to monitor the property?
Maybe report what is going on to the local PD?
I used to do the same thing when I went on long trips.  I would also bring extra things like blankets if it was winter.
You're so lucky!  I would do the same_comma_ except they don't make them in my size.
That is horrible! Why would he do something like that??? Did you do anything to stop him?
Awww. That was so nice of you guys! 
That's terrible! Did you call and tell management?
Thats frustrating. At least you'll get your money back eventually.
Oh no! I hate when that happens. Happens to me all the time. Did he forgive you?
That's not very nice of him. Is he older or younger?
that sounded like an ambitious endeavor_comma_ you must have felt sick afterwards
they will never know_comma_ as long they have candy and you can keep your dark secret to yourself
That sounds really good right about now! 
I may do the same as you because yes_comma_ this has been an extremely long monday
Man I bet you were devastated did you lose anything else?
I am sorry that happened to you _comma_ sometime bad things happen to good people
OMG!  That's insane.  How did you react?
Uh yeah!  I hope you got everything fixed. 
That sounds wonderful!  Time flies_comma_ doesn't it?
How long have you and he been together?
I bet you were terrified!  Did everything turn out okay?
Very true!  I'm glad it worked for you
Awww. I remember the first time I left my son with the babysitter. So many emotions. How old is he?
I bet it was! I am glad you survived. lol
That's wonderful!  Do they feel the same way?
I hope so_comma_ too!
Manhattan would be a great place to live. you'll love it there
never give up hope_comma_ one of these days you'll be waking up in the middle of Manhattan
Yes several times. I usually just end up cutting the hair shorter to get over it.
I bet_comma_ I'm sorry you got one. All I can recommend is cutting it shorter and let it grow back out. Or find a cool hat.
Yeah it is a solid art for sure.
I'd try to get a refund!
whitewater rafting seems like alot of fun. 
fun and dangerous my type of fun. glad you had fun
Dude! That sucks! I am so sorry about that. What happened?
Ugh! That really irritates me. I am so sorry that happened. Too bad they couldn't catch those creeps. 
That's too bad_comma_ did you ever get to ride horses at all?
Well I hope you get to be around horses someday!  I don't know much about them but they're so cool.
wow that must be scary to have someone break into your house
so you had a sentimental attachment to it_comma_ i understand but as long as you weren't harm
oh my gosh_comma_ did you actually lose the card?
It is I have had that happen with 2 of my cards and my debit card. I managed to track down through the charges who used the cards
Oh_comma_ you go girl! What did you do?
Awww_comma_ what a sweet woman you are. There aren't too many like you out there anymore. 
Oh wow! I would be furious_comma_ to say the least
Well that's good and hopefully the next one doesn't do it too
i don't blame you for siting around all day. 60 miles_comma_ I do't think i walk that in year
you deserve the rest after this week_comma_ must be a great feeling to accomplish what you did
oh that is terrible_comma_ it feels like your life is changing so fast_comma_ did everything turn out ok?
that is a scary situation_comma_ so glad everything turned out ok
Oh no. That sucks. Good thing you were close to home. 
Oh no! That sounds scary. 
that is so kind of you_comma_ we once adopted an abandon dog
i do not know either it is sad when a dog is abandon by their owners
Those are nothing to mess around with. They can be deadly.
No kidding. I would hate to have to come face to face with one.
OMG that is horrible! :( Im sure she needs you right now
I just can not imagine the heart ache! Poor baby
That is really gross. How did that happen??
Oh_comma_ I see. So_comma_ nothing really bad that could cause a problem really. lol
I don't think I would help again unless someone found me a face shield.
Table tennis is a wonderful game. Did you beat him?
Aw_comma_ I'm sorry you didn't win. Maybe next time. 
A delicious delicacy! Why were you stressed?
Oh! Bummer. Yeah stress gets to me too! Did you end up passing it?
That sounds like a great dog! what bread is he?
Labs are known for their loyalty and obedience. I bet he is a great companion 
Oh that sounds awful. Just makes things worse when they show up?
Well it sounds like you've done alright so far I'm sure the worst is behind you.
That was super nice of them_comma_ I bet it was a big surprise as well.
I love my kitchenaid. It has to be my most used appliance. I can see why you were so happy.
Oh_comma_ that little rat! That was not nice of him. What did you do?
Awesome! There needs to be more people like you in this world. 
That is unfortunate_comma_ how long have you been friends with this person?
There is surely a reason why. Did she have many family members as bridesmaids?
You are so lucky ! I still keep my 9 month old fur baby on a leash. What breed is your dog ?
Mine is a German Shepherd.  It is amazing how they walk so close to us_comma_ almost tripping over us in our path !
Oh thats so sweet that he taught you to play_comma_ he sounds like he was a sweet grandpa.
Well hang onto those tight and maybe you can teach someone to play chess in the future.
That's great. I hope you do well in your new job.
I'm sure it was_comma_ but it always a great idea to be looking to improve yourself or your position. Do what is best for you.
they probably think you are part of the Thai family
but it must be great food if you keep going back
I do the same. At least we're contributing to somebody's fortune.
You and me both.
Oh no that sounds terrible. I would hate to have such a financial burden suddenly sprang on me.
I'm sure you're not the only one. 
Oh_comma_ what did you find? hopefully not something ebarassing?
Oh that is awesome_comma_ what did you find?
That's good to hear! Why?
Wow_comma_ you definitely should be excited and looking forward to it!
that sounds great_comma_ what did your dog do?
it's satisfying when your pet does a trick_comma_ it feels like you and your pet accomplished something meaningful
Oh? What surprised you about today?
That sounds wonderful! I'm sure that felt great.
Aww_comma_ that is very sweet_comma_ kind and thoughtful of you! Has it been troubling for you because I am sure you also have a busy schedule
That is good_comma_ but if it ever becomes too stressful for you I hope that you are able to talk to your friend about it because there are plenty of alternative ways to get her mother to the hospital.
That's a nice gesture of her. It's nice that she trusts you like that.
Well obviously you're the more deserving one.
i love peaceful moments while relaxing. i bet that moment was much needed . i really like nature too
i like to garden so i know what you mean 
Oh_comma_ I can't wait to hear!
Wow_comma_ you trusted he would give it back and then he didn't. I can understand how angry you'd be!
Are we? 
Oh haha sorry I misread that! And that is great I am so excited to meet the bunny!! Do we have a name for it yet? 
Oh dang that sounds really scary. I'm assuming that since you're still here that you are okay?
You should probably stay out of that neighborhood in the future. Glad you're okay. Stay safe out there.
Oh man_comma_ I hate it when my dog starts barking at the neighbor dogs too. I'd be so mad at him for getting out though.
Oh man_comma_ that sounds super scary. I'm so glad your dog is okay I would be lost if amything happened to mine.
Omg my current dog does that sometimes. She pukes up bile if she doesn't eat_comma_ so I always have to make sure she is eating her food.
Oh gross that is disgusting. I hope your little buddy is okay though. I don't envy you at all.
Oh Fun! where did you go?
Did you have to go far?
Im jealous :P I need a vacation. The beach is so relaxing too 
That must have taken a lot of courage. What happened next?
That's great that you could do it. Maybe next time will go better.
Oh no!  What happened?
Oh_comma_ man.  That's a terrible feeling. What did you do?
that must be cool to see_comma_ something to break up the monotony of the day
that must have been a sight to see
what it is?
I bit it is a good and funny memory.
Oh no_comma_ please tell me that did not happen to you today.
Oh no_comma_ I hope you were alright! But yes that is a funny story to tell your friends :) 
You must feel terrible. That sucks.
Eh next year they'll have forgotten it mostly
Oh wow that is interesting. I assume he leaves at night to go eat_comma_ since he's still alive.
Hmmm_comma_ I guess you could look for the hole during the day and try patching it when the bats fly out for the evening? Im not a bat expert lol.
Oh_comma_ how was that? I've never been to camp. Was it fun at least?
That's great_comma_ I'm glad you had fun. What was your favorite activity?
I have been to Six Flags as a matter of fact.  I cant say that I enjoyed it much_comma_ as I hate to ride rides.  WHat about you?
I can so relate to your experience!  WHen I was a child my parents would try to coax me to ride and I hated it. I rode the ferris wheel once and started crying!
Omg_comma_ that had to be embarrassing and a mess to get up.
Oh no_comma_ even worse. Hope you got the job :)
I'm glad you're feeling better. I'm sorry you went through that_comma_ I hear that addition is tough and often starts after having a major surgical operation.
I'm glad you got the help you needed and ended up in an actually helpful rehab. It's always good when you have control of the things in your life. Just remember to stay strong when things get tough again and to lean on your support structure. 
Aww_comma_ why?
I'm so sorry to hear that. She is lucky to have you checking on her_comma_ you sound like a good friend.
I'm glad to hear it. What's got you so?
Wow! That's unbelievable. Congratulations! How much did you win?
Wow! that is some real dedication you have! Did you manage to pass the test? 
Wow that is great! I am so proud of you. And hey_comma_ it never hurts to study more. :) 
Haha! Poor you. Did you wreck your clothes?
I hope you didn't get burned too badly! I fall a lot. It never stops being embarrassing.
Oh I bet_comma_ probably made you feel sick to your stomach after.
That's good_comma_ easy to quickly notice that awful taste.
Oh no_comma_ what happened?
Oh wow! Where did all of this take place? Sounds like a rough part of town?!
I only used to watch Rugrats_comma_ and I still can't stand that show.  It was like the decline of the NIck lineup. 
I don't blame them.  The characters were annoying_comma_ and the color palate was horrible.
Wednesdays_comma_ why is that? I used to love Wednesdays because we always got out of school an hour early
Oh my fiance loves comics_comma_ he buys and sells them. Why is that the only thing to look forward to?
Aw_comma_ why is that? 
Oh that's hard but I'm sure you will get yours too. It's hard being patient though when others get theirs before you.
Probably not_comma_ but I don't remember. I was always a scaredy cat as a baby. Have you?
What a lovely memory! That's hilarious that your dad made you go back and return it! 
That is not good what happened?
Well I hope you here back from them and they will give good news.
That happened my freshman year with my best friend. It really sucks at first_comma_ but eventually you get used to it.
I'm still friends with my old roommate_comma_ but I found other people to spend my time with.
What is happening tomorrow night?
Nice_comma_ I hope you have a great time at the party! Have some fun for the both of us!
Did you ever get your own snowboard ? It looks like so much fun ! I see people on tv_comma_ where they are flying off mountain sides !
Thats wonderful. Oddly shaped Christmas presents usually make you want to open them EARLY just to get a peak :)
Oh wow_comma_ letting the dog roam free even when it's so new to the neighborhood? That seems like recipe for disaster. Your poor newspaper..
Maybe an airhorn or something would spook him off. Dogs tend not to like loud sounds_comma_ after all. 
Nice! Have you been getting lucky recently?
Wow! You are already super successful! I hope you help them kids!
do tell_comma_  what happened was it bad?
that is bad . goodness the nerve of some people.
Oh no_comma_ were you able to find your dog again? 
Aww_comma_ I am so glad that you were able to find him again! A dog truly is a man's best friend.
How did that work out?
Well that's good. I'm glad so far it has worked out :)
I would not of been happy with that were you?
Ain't that a whopping _comma_ I would have comp;ained to somebody about it.
Not that I can remember. If I did it would not have been too severe. Have you?
As I a child I imagine that would be incredibly scary. How did you find them again?>
What did you eat?
Oh gross_comma_ makes me never want McDonalds again.
Why! What happened?
Wow. I am disappointed in you too_comma_ you monster :(
Oh no! Did he replace it?
I get that. My sister broke my favorite coffee mug.
Why? What happened?
Dang! Your dog must have been so excited to see you come back!
Oh no_comma_ did you ask if they were alright and apologize? 
Oh no_comma_ how did he take it? 
I am a little too. Why are you scared?
Yeah_comma_ I can relate to that. I hate feeling like I don't know what dangerous marine life could be around me.
Awesome! Nothing like stringing together a long streak of feeling happy in the world. Anything in particular got you chipper?
Aww_comma_ that's tremendous. Those are big steps_comma_ but if ever there is a good-sign of a relationship_comma_ it's when those topics are approached happily. Congratulations!
Yeah I know what you ean! I have been to one before too and it was awesome! 
haha_comma_ yeah I know what you ean_comma_ but at least you know it is fresh! 
I have had an experience like that. I do believe in ghosts.
Could be either!
Ghosts?
Oh god_comma_ I hate bugs!
Ugh that's no fun especially with it being so cold.
Well that's good. Hopefully didn't take long to open up roads.
Wow. What for? Had you recently talked to her?
I bet you guys had a lot of catching up to do!
Aww! what for?
My dog needs some good training!
Friends really are the best part of life_comma_ I'd say. I can't imagine what I'd do without some of those folks in my life. 
That's a good friends right there. Looking out for your best interests is a sign that they're truly a keeper.
Oh no_comma_ did he place the blame on you_comma_ or did he just accept it and take the blame for you? 
Aw_comma_ that just shows that he is a great friend. Maybe you can treat him to lunch for the rest of the week for taking the fall for you. I am sure he would really appreciate that :) 
Oh that's awesome. Do you like her?
That's great_comma_ nothing better :)
That's good! Cheating is not good for a relationship.
For sure. I luckily have not had anyone cheat on me.
I cannot imagine. Where from?
Can you facetime them?
I understand. I have had to do that before. My family was very giving.
I had to borrow money to get a second degree. Hurt my pride_comma_ but it's okay.
Good for you! I'm glad you were able to face it by yourself. Where were you flying?
Cool! Was that your first time flying by yourself?
Wow_comma_ that's amazing! Did you enjoy the flight back or were you still scared?
Nice what show?
No_comma_ I haven't. I've heard of it_comma_ though. What is it about?
Oh my goodness! That happens to me often. I just get distracted with whatever is playing in front of me and eat everything in my hands!
I would think that being an only child would be somewhat boring and lonely.   HOw bad can it be with your brother?
That's not cool!  I hope you did well in spite of not having your lucky pencil.  Siblings can be quite pesky at times!
Wow_comma_ did anyone see?
Well_comma_ I hope it does not happen again!
Oh no! How so?
A stripper_comma_ I see. Well what she does not know will not hurt her.
Why would they do that?
I know someone with that. She might need some medication.
Wow_comma_ hope it wasn't serious.
Why didn't you perform well?
Oh_comma_ Congrats on your newborn.
That must have really hurt. When did you realize he was always lying to you?
What was the lie?
Are you still friends?
I'm so sorry. That is horrific.
I hope you are in some therapy. That can take a toll on the average person.
I had never visited there. But it reminds me of Athenas and that old cities
Do u remember the name of that Island? 
I would like to visit it one day too
I agree. I am watching pictures of it right now
Aw_comma_ that is really sweet of him. What did the note say?
Wow. That is incredibly romantic. You're a lucky girl! 
I
Mine passed away too. She was a great woman.
How did it go?
I bet they love games.
Nice_comma_ how long do you usually take your dog for a walk?
Your dog must be very healthy !
I'm so sorry! Report him!
You are much better off
What did you make?
I would love some of that right now.
Why!? What happens next week?
Dang! I hope you got them big discounts before you ordered them!
They are. I have several.
I have a few bears.
I'm so sorry. You should talk to a therapist.
I'm sorry. Maybe she just needs time to process things.
What!? Did anyone see?
Dang_comma_ it must have been embarassing
Who are you referring to?
Oh no. That sounds awful. I'm sorry to hear abut your friend. Is he better now?
Congregation but what are you passionate about?
That is good
where to?
how was the weather?
Wow! Must have been really really important
Oh_comma_ then its okay
whoa that's nuts. how many did you have to kick to get out alive?
oh good. well what did they end up wanting?
well I hope you're ok now
oh sweet_comma_ how many do you own now?
It's always good to unwind after a tough day. How did you celebrate?
Erm. Well_comma_ I hope that comes true for you. Betting better can sometimes be more about believing it. Maybe your cat believe he is fine.
Good.
My cat is doing good. : ) He's gained some weight_comma_ since I trimmed his fur. NO more hairballs.
Oh shoot_comma_ why is that?
That may be gross_comma_ but she is just putting effort into her appearnce.
how'd they react?
oh man that sounds embarrassing. I would've just run out of the store and country
Oh no_comma_ what happened?
You should be able to trust that he won't do anything shady when he talks to other girls. If you can't trust him then that might mean you need to reevaluate your relationship with him. 
Oh_comma_ Do you think you did well?
Wishing you all the best!!
Have you ever kept secrets from her?
It must be nice to be in trusting and safe relationship like that.
Its good you made that decision
Who are they you are referring
Dang! Did they get home safely?
I wish I had a cool friend like you!
It's good that your wife trusts you
You two are lucky to have each other!
THat is extremely noble of you!   YOu did the right thing!!
I would too.  I have lost things before and never had anyone turn them in and its not a good feeling.
What did you do?
Dang! Maybe you can send me some too
Dang_comma_ was it from craigslist?
I am too scared of getting scammed from those
Dang! What kind of games did you play?
I heard it is one of the best games of this generation!
praying won't do anything_comma_ but did you study well?
and what was that?
Did he exceed your expectations?
That is the thing about athletes_comma_ it is crazy how gifted they are compared to an average person.
Family is one of the most important things to have in life. 
Yes your a lucky person and I'm happy for you.
Yes I do
Wow_comma_ you must be very proud of her
Yes_comma_ Hurricane Harvey destroyed my city!
Dang_comma_ well I hope these things don't happen again!
I bet you are _comma_ So did she just purchase a new house?
That is incredible _comma_ my dad had canswer and we had people from our church pray for him and others did as well and his cancer went into remission.
Wow - that's a significant amount of time! How has that been for you?
It sounds like you really care about her. I hope everything works out great for you guys!
Oh my! I hope that he did not feel badly about it. That sort of thing is normal for children
Aw_comma_ I love that he had you there with him when it happened. I bet that made it feel a bit better for him
That is amazing! A parent will always love their children regardless of past decisions. How did you find her?
That is truly amazing! I wish you the best of luck! And I am sure she loves you still!
No. I have kids_comma_ but they are toddlers.
I imagine. I left my parents and my country when I was 25 years old. 
I bet that makes you angry _comma_ mine use to do the same thing and it made me furious.
HJow do you put up with it _comma_ I Know I could not do it.
What!? What's going on?
That is very unfortunate_comma_ I hope things turn around for you my friend!
Why? Did he do something terrible?
Wow_comma_ he is super rude! Beat him up!
Dang! Do you look like your parents?
Yup_comma_ time goes by too fast!
Financial stress can be a major burden. How did you get over this issue?
That is a smart and well thought out plan
Would you be able to forgive her for such a large mistake?
That is true. And the mistake would not happen again so you do not have to worry about that
I can understand that. It took me many years before I learned to have complete faith in my wife.
The only thing I can tell you is to have faith in her judgement. If you ever lose it_comma_ it is time to cut your losses and run because it will only lead to hurt and ruin.
Love her while you can and enjoy your life together. Children grow up fast_comma_ i have two_comma_ a six year old girl and a nine year old boy. They are handfuls
Does your boss call on you a lot?
You should keep your head down_comma_ not make eye contact_comma_ and make a mean face! He won't call on you then!
That's really kind of you. What good customer service!
You deserve a raise for that mentality
Wow that is impressive! how long did you train for it?
Oh no! did you get hurt?
That is scary! I am glad you played it safe and decided to stop! there is always another marathon to run!
Absolutely! And I am sure next time you will be able to finish 
Wow! Did you punish him or anything?
Well I hope he learns his lesson!
Why_comma_ that's not good
What do you plan to do
result for what
yeah you clearly are well read. what does he study?
Nope_comma_ it is too scary for me!
Nice_comma_ I hope I can overcome my fear one day too!
ah I was never much of a sports guy_comma_ but I do work out a lot. do you still play?
and now they're rattled around by 250lb guys smashing into you
haha yeah. I'm worried about hurting myself by working out too hard
haha I wish it was that simple
What is that?
Congrats!!!! It is an amazing experience! I just had a little baby girl 3 weeks ago
Take it one day at a time man. It is a truly amazing thing. You will love that baby with all your heart
I understand. Just be supportive as your girlfriend is probably thinking the same thing. Just remember you are now both in this together so enjoy the experience.
Wow what kind of exams are you taking?
Sounds hard! I hope you do well in your exams!
That's very trusting. Did they come back with the milk?
Good for them. Nice to know that there are good people left in the world
I bet!
Sometimes it can get tricky when family and money are involved. Did he pay you back?
Oh man! I hope it all works out for you. 
what'd he do?
well maybe you should find another job
Who did he bit
What can you do to help him stop drinking
Wow congrats! Is it a boy or a girl?
Dang_comma_ well I hope she has a wonderful future!
I hope there was a good reason for that!
Maybe you should talk face to face with him next time you see him.
I talked with my boss recently because I thought he was angry at me but it turned out he was just having problems at home.
I am sure everything will work out just fine!
Why? what is in that room?
The same habit that I took up
Really?  Have you watched any zombie movies or shows lately?
Well that might explain it_comma_ those zombies aren't very nice!
Cute!!! what did you name it?
What kind of dog is she?
I find them creepy too. I am actually very scared of them.
Oh no thats pretty gross! I hope that is not true_comma_ because if it is that is gross.
Have you voiced your opinion to him yet?
Parents always think they know best. Until their children prove them wrong they tend to think that. 
What kind of e
As you're hopeful_comma_ you will get it
I'm sorry to hear that. are you angry at him?
well you better make sure of that. tell him if he forgets again you'll divorce him
you're very lucky to have such family! when are you getting married?
well _comma_ that's insane! i'm glad you find you life partner _comma_ and i hope everything goes the way you guys planned !
Wow that is a long time! How did you do?
Exactly! that is a great outlook to have. You did your best and as long as you are happy personally all the rest does not matter
Oh no! Have you ever had one before?
Yeah_comma_ but sometimes these things can't be avoided.
You are so lucky_comma_i have been long for such a break for so long.
You get relaxed and even get more productive when you get back to work. 
That is amazing! It is nice to hear that things are going so well for you and your family!
That is wonderful! I wish you and your family the best! Sending positive energy_comma_ love_comma_ and light your way.
Is it just temporary?
Sometimes things are a necessary evil. And who knows as long as you keep your options open the perfect job may be right around the corner.
oh dear_comma_ that must've been embarrassing_comma_ are you okay though?
i hope that you didn't get hurt
Girl_comma_you are so lucky. You got a good one. better things are on the way for you.
On my 30th birthday_comma_ my wife bought me my dream car. A Jeep. I never saw it coming.
it's nice to have someone who can help you always_comma_ i'm pretty sure she loves having you by her side always
she probably appreciate you so much for doing that. 
That's too bad. I can't have dogs in my apartment either. Why won't they let you have one?
Our second family dog died last year. She was the runt of the litter_comma_ so it was a surprise since she was a small dog.
Ah_comma_ that's so exciting! Is he looking forward to it?
That's so cool_comma_ I'm sure he'll love it and make some great friends!
Do they have any sentimental value for you?
Well then maybe it is time to get rid of them?
Wow_comma_ did you fall on your butt that hard?
That is unfortunate_comma_ but funny at the same time!
why are you scared of leaving your current job? if you have been offered a better job then just leave you know?
maybe you should ask i think that's the easiest way of discovering what is better for you!
What made it hectic?
oh_comma_ I understand. Was it a long interview?
What happened?
Uhnnn_comma_most of us did!
What about the cats though?
You monster! Everyone loves animals
What have you eaten?
You are living life. 
What happened?
Dang_comma_ that is very unfortunate.
At least you have a wife. Probably would if it weren't for fights over dumb things.
I hope you are right.
Did you feel scared?
Was the drive a necessary one to take?
Uhmnnn_comma_you really did?
Did you have a sum inside?
It's always good to have a boss you can get along with.  It makes work a lot less stressful.
Yes a boss who is helpful and has a good attitude will have earned my loyalty from the beginning.  The better I feel about work the better I perform in the long run.
Tell me more_comma_i would love to know!
Perfect state of mind.  I will take that any day.
your friend is probably one of the luckiest people on earth. how do you feel about it/
well_comma_ you know everything happens for a reason. 
of course I would
What made you do that?
Oh I hate group work for that exact reason. I'd rather just have company while I did the work
What a shame. I wouldn't make them my partner again. (and I might venture so far as to notify the professor)
I am so sorry to hear about your dog. What happened to him?
At least he lived a long_comma_ happy life. 
i'm pretty sure they were more than happy to help you because they are your parents in the end.
see? they can't get mad at you so you shoudn't feel ashamed_comma_ instead search for another job and help them.
You are so hyped for the day. I wish that will be the same for me.
It pays to always be kind. Even if you don't get rewarded immediately but at least you helped someone.
mind telling me what happened maybe i could help you?
you don't deserve a best friend like that. or even a relationship where you have to keep fighting for the attention. i suggest you leave both of them and look for your future with other people!
That's great. I never did a long distance one. But my brother did_comma_ and it was about 400 miles.
She was a keeper though_comma_ I'm sure it was worth it for him.
good for you. where have you been?
what'd you do there?
oh I see. do you have kids together
That's a good idea!
Hopefully!
Great_comma_ what happend?
Cool_comma_ I never played the drums. My band teacher in middle school tried to discourage playing the drums cause there are no notes!
sounds like a good adventure! where are you going to climb?
well hopefully you won't die. be careful and make sure you have fun!
I hope it turned out great. Did you find a good hairdresser to do your hair?
Oh_comma_ I'm so sorry that happened to you. I really hope you were able to get the color fixed eventually.
Oh I'm so sorry to hear that_comma_ how long have they been gone.
Oh wow....I hope you can get through it.
That must have been embarrassing. Did the girls get in trouble for it?
I would have switched schools if I were you. I would hate to have to be with bullies like that
Did she punish you?
I hope she didn't make you feel too bad about it! People make mistakes when they're young.
That's terrible. Hopefully things right themselves for you soon.
The plus side about schools is that someone else will do something that everyone will focus on soon enough.
Was the guitar okay?
I stepped on my uncle's fishing pole_comma_ kinda hard to tell if it catches fish worse or not.
holy cow! Why did she go to jail?
I'm glad y'all were able to make it through such a hard time.
Woah_comma_ I never had that happen to me.
Yes_comma_ we can truly not judge people because unless you are very close with a person you can't know their full story!
I am sure that was difficult.  How is he now?
I am so sorry for your loss.  It can be a relief to know he isn't in pain.  I felt the same way when I lost my Aunt last year.  She was like a mom to me.
How did the school feel about it? Don't they have strict rules about that?
That's funny and unfortunate at the same time. I really hope your son was okay and not too traumatised by the experience!
Wow_comma_ that would have scared me_comma_ how did it go?
that's good I have 2 teenage daughters and dread the idea of leaving them by themselves
That's a really big change_comma_ are you nervous?
10 years of teaching experience_comma_ I'm sure you'll end up having a great year! Don't stress too much.
if you regret what you did you should go apologise for you said to him!
i hope he can forgive you and help you forget about what you said.
you'll need to be careful around me then. I'm the type of person who takes advantage of people
yeah but maybe we'll fall in love instead?
Why? What's happening today? 
Oh_comma_ my goodness. I really hope you're right and that the results come out negative.
You want cancer results to come out negative for cancer_comma_ not positive for it.
thats amazing. where was the concert? and how many people were participated?
cool!! even i wanted to learn guitar.. but have no time for it
did he came back to take it?
you are a trustworthy person_comma_ glad he forgot it at your place not somewhere else
I think a lot of people feel the same_comma_ it's natural. Is there anything in particular that you're scared of happening? 
There is a lot you can't control in life though. If you focus on the things you can control_comma_ then it might stop the negative feelings about things you can't control
I'm sorry about that. What did he do?
Wow_comma_ well he will have to learn his lesson before he will get a job or go to college. That won't work there.
well I mean...does she really? or do you just think she does
well you should be more worried about dying in a car accident_comma_ because that's 10x more likely. drive safe
that's great_comma_ what kind of job was it?
That's great_comma_ my one son spent time in a childrens hospital and the care was fantastic could not have been happier with them
That's really interesting. Do you think it benefits them learning from you rather than qualified teachers? 
I suppose as long as they're happy that's the main thing! It probably benefits them being around other kids their age?
I see_comma_ being alone can be fulfilling to. It all depends on the kind of person you are.
Yes_comma_ we can discover our inner worlds whenever we're alone!
why? i had the same thing happening to me with my dog. is she somewhere safe though?
that's okay. you can always get yourself another dog.
That's amazing_comma_ It's always nice to get on with your family! Have you always got on with them? 
that's so nice to hear. I have always been very close with my family too_comma_ but I have friends who aren't and it's horrible
Well_comma_ if you provided for your child's care then you shouldn't feel bad. I mean_comma_ this isn't the dark ages.
I am sorry you feel so bad about it. I sincerely believe God will forgive a truly repentant heart.
That's so good. How old is she?
I know how you feel. Congrats on raising a young adult
that's really nice - it's always amazing to have friends who you feel comfortable around. What was the new thing your friend made you do? 
Oh wow! I like getting out of my comfort zone and doing new things_comma_ it's such a thrill. Especially rock climbing - I had a friend who made me do it once too
Do you hate when anybody tells you what to do_comma_ or just figures of authority? 
would you feel better if it was in the form of advise_comma_ instead of point blank telling you to do something? 
I think if you're confident in yourself_comma_ you can talk yourself into most jobs. You should give yourself more credit and not say you were lucky! 
I think so too! I think people should have more confidence in themselves_comma_ but you always focus on the negative things more than the positive! 
I'm so jealous_comma_ I would eat pizza every day if I could! What's your favourite pizza? 
I'm not a fan of pineapple on pizza!! Pepperoni is by far my favourite 
I'm sorry to hear that. What are you studying?
It certainly will.
That's an amazing attitude. Not many people are like that nowadays.
Crazy world we live in.
Oh wow_comma_ was in unprovoked? 
Did you try to apologise before she hit you_comma_ or did you not have time? 
You must be having bitter _comma_sweet emotion.I remember my mom was also emotional when i left boarding school for the first time.
But you can make arrangements such that you see him every weekend.
I'm sorry to hear that. Did you apologize?
I think if you're respectful and state what you did wrong and how you'll fix it_comma_ she will forgive you.
what happened?
oh my god_comma_ how embarrassing was that? 
That is extremely loyal! You must have a really happy relationship? 
It sounds like you really have had a good life so far! It makes me feel happy hearing good news stories like this 
That's so nice of you. Hardwork pays
Oh yeah_comma_ you must be a brilliant student
That's so nice. Who was it from?
That was really nice of her to get it for you. She must love you very much.
Oh no! That's awkward. Are you able to laugh about it now?
Ha_comma_ that's good! I've had so many embarrassing things happen. We all have!
Oh_comma_ maybe that's a sign to bring fun and adventure in your relationship?
That's good_comma_ there is a lot of ways to make the relationship alive and interesting!
That's such a shame! Were you honest with your friend_comma_ and did they forgive you? 
If she is that good a friend_comma_ I'm sure she'll forgive you soon enough. 
sending my positive vibes to you too! Fingers crossed! 
Oh I'm so sorry. Losing a pet is never an easy thing.
I hope you have some friends and family that you can rely on to cheer you up. I'm sorry about your cat and I hope you know you gave it a good life!
skydiving is insane to me_comma_ how did it go? what reminded you of it?
it's always good to have a professional help with this kind of things_comma_ glad you had fun!
That's incredibly sad_comma_ I'm so sorry for your loss. How long had you had your dog? 
Do you have close friends and family that can help to support you through this time? 
Oh_comma_ No! What caused so many innocent deaths?
I think war is universal. The causes are many.
did they anything mean to you? 
oh_comma_ it was an accident_comma_ and it's alright. as long as you make sure that you use the right seasoning next time. it's all gonna be okay.
How did you get into this situation? 
well I think she should be the one to get you out of it! Otherwise perhaps you could see a financial adviser. They might be able to help you consolidate your debts 
Well I have never heard of God helping with financial situations but perhaps if you pray and scrape together enough money for a ticket to Las Vegas all your troubles will be gone
This is a lot to ask for. I recommend going straight to the pope for something of this magnitude
Wow! Some delivery driver must be excited about their latest acquisition! 
I didn't mean to sound so flippant. That is a lot of money to lose. Was the item itself expensive also?
Well_comma_ I hope they can trace it for you. Better late than never. I wish you good luck with that! 
I'm really glad to hear that! That's one of the best feelings I think!
I very much agree! Being grateful is important_comma_ it keeps you level headed and grounded in life!
oh god_comma_ that sounds horrifying_comma_ are you and your family okay?
that's great_comma_ glad you managed to make everything okay afterwards_comma_ that must've been a lot of hard work!
Oh_comma_ my goodness! Are you and your family safe though?
That's a relief. You have the people who matter safe and sound_comma_ the stuff can be replaced in time.
Well_comma_shes your wife after all
Thats women for you.Where you frugal with money?
Oh amazing! How long were you training for_comma_ and how many people did you beat? 
That's incredible_comma_ well done! I injured my knee a few months back_comma_ so haven't been able to run since then. so frustrating
Aaawww_comma_  I'm sorry you had to go through that
It is really hard to deal with  Especially if you aren't nearby. Sounds like you really miss your sweet beast! 
Oh I'm sorry you are going through that. Have you tried to go back to your doctor and discuss making some changes?
I hope that you can find a solution to help with that. Good luck!
That must have been so nice for both of you. Had he changed for the better?
People do change a lot when they grow up. I met an old school friend the other day_comma_ and they were awful now! 
Oh that's so sad_comma_ i'm really sorry about that. Is it possible to apply for a loan again in the future for the same house? 
that's such a shame. I'm sure something similar will come up soon though 
oh no_comma_ what a nightmare! Was anyone injured? 
That's good then_comma_ as long as no one waa hurt! was he drunk? 
That's cool_comma_ a good relationship is based on trust 
Have you always been very trusting? 
I like food.  What kind?
That is a legit lunch.  Solid choices.  A+  would eat.
Aw that is very kind of you. I love morning coffee!
Haha! I think a lot of people can probably relate to that. I'm sure she appreciates it!
oh no. How bad was it?
I can see how it would make you anxious. 
Is it because you are surrounded by people most of the time? I get that way sometimes too_comma_ so I can relate.
It is good that you enjoy your alone time. Sometimes we just need a little "me-time".
That sounds like so much fun! Were you scared?
My daughter got scared of haunted house once. It was hilarious_comma_ but I sympathise with her and you.
Yuck! At least the cockroach isn't in your kitchen anymore! My cats like to catch mice and bring them to the front door.
I wouldn't have been able to either! It's super gross!
Oh I bet that is frustrating!  Can you report it to someone?
I would feel the same way.  Perhaps you could mention it to your co-worker nicely and they will take pity on you.  
What kind of vacuum is it? I bought a Dyson recently and I love it!
Those vacuums are amazing and are one of a kind. You should get it!
That's so sweet Literately. He seems like a nice guy 
Nice! you are a lucky lady. 
Oh I'm sorry that you are going through that. Have you discussed changing your medication up with your doctor?
I hope one day you can find a solution and get back to being the old you.
Oh wow_comma_ It must have been quite an overwhelming experience for both of you
Congrats because I know you will definitely overcome the pains
Wow! The struggle is real. I hope you're not too tired and stressed. I wish you luck for being so selfless! 
Do twins run in your family or are you just lucky? I mean that seriously_comma_ not sarcastically 
That's awesome! You won the kiddo lottery! I wish you all the best of health and happiness!!! 
that's sad I hate to hear that how long did you have him
I love boxers they are so cool looking do you plan on getting another one?
Oh wow! Congratulations on getting promoted_comma_ that is awesome!!
I bet_comma_ that's usually how it goes_comma_ but so glad to hear of your promotion. I bet you're super happy!
You are the best wife ever! I can't believe how lucky he is!
What did he get sick with? I hope it's not contagious! 
oh yeah_comma_ did you end up passing?
I remember those day's and do not miss them
That's terrifying!  Did they catch the guy?
I'm so sorry.  How are you coping?
You must have been in so much pain. How did you manage to endure it?
It great you were confident despite your illness. It's a sign of good character.
That is awesome and sounds like so much fun! What are you most excited for?
I can relate! I love to tan and haven't had the chance to yet either!
I really want to try Yoga! Would you say your back feels better? This sounds so fun!
I'm jealous! I wish I could try it out for myself. How long have you been doing it now?
oh that's awesome what kind of puppy did you get?
that's too cool I would love to get a puppy some day
That's awesome rain is good
oh no. so what do you do in such instance?
Oh my goodness thats terrible. How did you find out?
I believe that's for the best. You should get regularly tested after this. I hope the best for you.
Omg_comma_ sounds creepy
I am glad you escaped it
Oh no_comma_ the dreaded fly being down for the big meeting. How'd it go?
Uh oh. I hope whoever saw it had a little chuckle then let it go. It's no big deal.
That's truly heartbreaking. Were you able to help them? 
Your heart was in the right place. It sad that children can't be fed in our world today. Maybe one day nobody will have to be hungry.
So what happened then
OK_comma_ now I understand. Maybe she later got a ride home
Wow! How old is your child? That's very impressive!
Wow! I can't even do that now! I bet you are very proud of her.
That's unfortunate. Maybe you can have a chat with them about it?
That must be so infuriating. I'd get upset if it were me.
Congratulations! How much did you win?
Hey that's awesome. And you're right it doesn't_comma_ so live it up my friend!
This happened to me! Don't feel bad_comma_ it happens to people such as us!
She'll forgive you eventually. You'll never make the same mistake again I promise you that!
Has he given you any hints that he might be planning a party? That would be so much fun to be with all your family and friends in one place to celebrate you!!
That is a lot of people!! You are loved and appreciated! Now_comma_ its time to start planning his suprise birthday
Husbands can be so thoughtful... You have a good one..
Oh no_comma_ I am so sorry to hear that. That is awful and makes me sad. Have you talked to anyone about it?
That's what you need to focus on is just giving her all of your love_comma_ she will cherish it. I'm so sorry you're going through this_comma_ I hope that you can find peace with the situation.
I am glad_comma_ I hope you have a great day today!
Wow_comma_ that's so cool of you. You really trust her
I really admire your love life. 
Are you ok? That's absolutely devastating. I hope you have people to confide in right now.
I hope things get better for you_comma_ you seem to be a good soul. I pray for your lose.
I'm sorry to hear that. While diet is most of it_comma_ exercise can play a role too. How active is your lifestyle?
I know it might seem like empty words from a stranger but just keep at it. Try as hard as you can to stay positive you will see results_comma_ trust me.
can't you place a call to them?
I just think you should just be optimistic and patient
That's amazing! Congratulations. What was the policy that changed?
Well that's great for you. Everybody loves a little extra money!
I'm sorry that's rough.  Did you ever find out why?
I guess not_comma_ but I hope you still had (or will have if it hasn't happened yet) a great wedding!
That is really scary. Did he ever catch up with you?
Thank goodness. Do you know who he was?
How close did you lose by? I bet at the next competition_comma_ you'll wipe the floor with them.
Understandable_comma_ when you put so much work into something only to be eclipsed by someone else. Not a good feeling.
Oh my goodness that is so sad_comma_ I am sorry to hear about your father. Are you handling him being gone okay?
I understand completely. I hope that you can enjoy going to more games_comma_ and carry on his spirit when you go.
Always!
Oh no! That is really embarrassing. Hopefully she can move on from it and you can laugh about it one day.
At least it wasn't something you did on purpose. I'm sure it will blow over!
I think it's so weird that cats do that. It's like they are bringing us trophies or something!
Yeah I would be a little horrified too if my cat did that! I'm dying of laughter thinking about your situation.
That's so sweet. It's good to have that kind of faith in your relationships.
Congratulations. I hope you stay happy always.
have you called any rescue center yet?
Lets hope it will trace the house back
Oh wow_comma_ good for you. That education will help you the rest of your life! 
It can be frightening_comma_ especially with all those new classmates and teachers. 
Oh man_comma_ I would have been really frustrated. Does she know he is dating you now?
It's never fun to see your significant other around someone they used to date. At least he is with you now and I'm sure you have nothing to worry about!
I totally understand the anxiety. You never know if they are baiting you or actually giving you a good deal. Did you get a new car?
I'm so happy you were able to get a dependable vehicle. I always have someone come with me as well. It's nice to have a second pair of eyes.
I'm so sorry to hear about that_comma_ it must be awful. Do you have friends and family that you can talk to about this? 
When my relatives have died_comma_ it helps me to remember the good times_comma_ and makes me smile instead of being sad
Aw_comma_ he sounded like such a great friend! 
I am so sorry_comma_ that is so tragic. At least you have some good memories with him. 
That is so sweet.  I really commend people who treat kids like their own_comma_ it's so important for a kid to grow up feeling like they have a lot of people in their corner.  I have a stepdaughter myself.
Yes_comma_ it's true in life too when you grow up_comma_ sometimes the best family has nothing to do with blood relations.
Oh no now that's a sticky situation! How'd you manage?
Yeah hopefully all the hoopla over the first day distracted everyone. I am sorry that happened to you though.
Oh man_comma_ I am sorry! I have been there_comma_ it sucks! Are you okay though?
I am glad you are okay. I wrecked my favorite car 3 years ago and I still miss it.
Oh really?  What was it for?
Oh wow_comma_ I can only imagine.  Paperwork is not fun.  I hope you got it all done eventually!
Thats aweful!
Uhmnnn!
That is great_comma_ that is the beginning of happiness
Wow_comma_ that is true love
Wow_comma_  that's lovely. So you will start keep fit
It will help you_comma_  even in blood circulation 
Oh no! How did they react?
What did you do? I would just laugh it off.
That's a shame_comma_ I'm sorry. Does she have anything to keep her occupied while you work?
I believe that_comma_ a lot of people think because you're at home that you have time for things other than work.
I am sorry to hear about your dog passing away. But_comma_ I'm happy you have a new friend in the new one.
It's good you were able to find new companionship in your new dog. Congratulations on your new pet.
I hear you! Is she going out with her girlfriends?
Ahh_comma_ sounds like a tough situation. Maybe you should try letting your girlfriend know how you feel.
She is a grown women so you cant tie her up or she will choke. I hope everything works out for you. 
How mortifying! Did anyone hear it? Did it smell?
Yikes! I can't even imagine how embarrassing that was.
happy riding to your daughter
please do Asap!
That's awesome_comma_ I hope he returns the favor as well.
That's amazing. Love is absolutely grand. I am happy for you two.
Oh yeah_comma_  I've been there_comma_  I really understand 
You will really have enough time to rest
That sounds wonderful!  Do you get to use them yet?
I haven't had a chance to try bath bombs yet.  But my daughter in-law loves them.
Oh no! Kids do that sometimes. What happened?
It's hard when they grow up. Hopefully she will learn from her mistakes.
Oh no! I would be angry too!
Yes_comma_ they do. It's a season of learning.
Oh that sounds good!  I'm sure you studied lots?
That is excellent news.  You must be very proud.
hey that's not too bad how long are you going for?
lol hey a week is a reasonable time to pack three backs_comma_ I would do the same
Wow_comma_ how did that almost happen? I would rethink my options.
Good keep temptations at a distance. You never want to mess up a good relationship over a one night stnad.
Did they do a good job of cleaning your house?
That would make me nervous_comma_ you never know if they are looking through your things. 
That helps a lot with the peace of mind. I am glad it worked out well for you!
It is nice when they can build up that trust with you!
That's a shame. Do you know who stole it?
Did they take anything else?
Oh no. That happened to my sister last year. We were able to work out a plan_comma_ but she had to get a loan temporarily.
That's no fun_comma_ but I hope everything works out for next semester.
Ok _comma_how much raise did you get?
How much please?
Too bad you've been let down so often. I'm glad your new worker is satisfactory.
It's good to have someone so trustworthy. Congratulations.
Do you still live nearby?
It's good that you have pleasant memories.  What was your favorite thing about the neighborhood?
Did you like it? What did you buy?
That's too bad. I hope they didn't charge you for the items they missed.
I'm so sorry_comma_ you must feel terrible. It's their loss in the long run.
I can imagine you're very angry. You'll find someone better.
oh man that's not good at all! Did he break anything?
oh that's really nice of you I am glad he's okay
It's awesome to have a partner like that. That's certainly why they call it "the other half."
I second that. Finding that eternal partner is one of the greatest joys a human being can experience.
Well I toast you to 10 more and beyond.
How did it turn out?
Oh no! How awful! Did your Thanksgiving improve?
I would be mortified!
Cool! Where did you move too?
Oh_comma_ that does not seem like such hard work. It is fun to move into new houses. I like moving around.
Oh good! So glad it is all working out. I will come by and say hi one day. Catch you later!
i understand_comma_ life can do that to you_comma_ and looking back always bring fond memories
just think_comma_ today will be tomorrow's memories when looking back
Oh! Did you find any good deals?
Uh oh...Was it tainted? I wouldn't risk it...
Flag football is so much fun! What position would you like to play?
You could certainly bring some physicality to the position with your height. I say go for it!
that's really good... I am very sorry for your loss. It sounds cliche but it gets better with time
you're gonna be okay. It's been five years since I've lost mine. Just keep her close to your heart.
That was so nice of them_comma_ what kind of pets?
Quite the little zoo.  What a great friend you have!
I'm so sorry for your loss!
Oh_comma_ sorry to hear that. There is something going around these days. I hope they are better now.
That sounds so sweet . Family time is the best!
i know me too! Why are you ready?
yeah it does! Great job man I'm proud of you!
you are prepared more than ever !
that's the spirit! always believe in yourself!
I have not_comma_ I feel like it should be done by a professional. 
Oh no! Probably tons of years of dirt caked into the rug. Did you use the right cleaner?
Maybe the dirt adds to the whole antique feel of them. 
I hope you can find a solution that works for you!
That must've been fun! What did you guys do?
Oh that sounds like so much fun! sounds like you are very grateful for good friends! 
That sounds like a really lovely way to go somewhere in a car!
On no! I'm sorry you were embarrassed_comma_ but I'm sure it sounded wonderful! 
What game do you play?
Ohhhh. What kind of game is it?
wow_comma_ is it the first time you're gonna see him? is he going to stay at your place?
sounds like you planned for everything! enjoy yourself! 
Thats awesome_comma_ never settle for less. Always strive for more!
Well hopefully you can still maintain communication with them. It's normal to be nervous though_comma_ just go in confident
That's the best way to do it. Read before you buy.
It's amazing how dirty they can get_comma_ isn't it.
yes_comma_ my internet provider is notorious for that
oh wow_comma_ did they justify the overcharge? i'd dispute it
That must have been a good thing did y'all celebrate.
hard work should pay off nice to hear about some one getting back after they put in congratulations.
Yeah_comma_ my cousin actually borrowed my car to take his driving test
I don't blame you!  He should have been more responsible.
What?
Omg_comma_ what happened?
Pesky snakes. Was it a black racer? I see those all the time in my yard.
I would too! lol.
That's awesome! Is something holding you back?
Buying a home can be nerve wracking but in the end it's worth it!
Wishing you luck and here's to finding the perfect home!
Sometimes I'm worried that I'm that family member_comma_ but I'm not sure what to do to make them have confidence in me.
I'm happy that your brother is in sobriety now. I hope his life recovers.
I am sorry that happened . I have 3 dogs myself.
Good dogs are hard to vfind I can imagine how sad that must have been.
I enjoy reading.
It's cool that you're such a fan though. I hope the movie lived up to your expectations.
Oh_comma_ yes I remember those days too so clearly. Such carefree day_comma_ right?
Yeah_comma_ it was like the only thing to do in summer. The whole town comes out and the pool is crowded! Oh_comma_ those were the days!
What did you see?
A what on the handle?
Me too. About friends an d family. Things I got to see and do.
Yes. Some more than others. But sometimes I think it's all relative.
Oh no! How did that end?
That's not good. I'm sorry that happened to you.
Oh that is so selfish. Did you try and get back at her?
Thats great_comma_ says a lot about the type of person you are_comma_ in a good way! I probably would've gone for revenge knowing myself.
Is it because you trust their judgement or is there a different reason?
That's great that you have that type of relationship with him. My husband and I approach things together and discuss everything_comma_ which works great for us. You have to do what works for you and your relationship.
That's always a good thing.
That will be really convenient.  There's one near us we like to skateboard to.
Oh no! I hate that! So what did you do about it?
Wow_comma_ no power at home is terrible. What would we do without electricity?!
Poor dog! Did you find out why? Is it better now?
Aww_comma_ that's cute! I love older dogs_comma_ but I know it can be scary sometimes when they show signs of poor health. I'm glad he was okay!
Oh! What was it about?
I hate clowns! when I try to run I sink into the ground.
Oh no! I hate spiders! Were you able to avoid them and move your pots?
If people knew it was because of spiders they'd totally understand. I can't stand their creepy crawly bodies!
I have a friend like that. We lose touch but we will always be great friends.
That's awesome. Now I miss my friend. lol
Do you guys live far away from each other? I love talking with my mom about her and my childhood.
Aw that's awesome. I bet he enjoyed getting to know your past a little bit better.
Oh no.  Did he stand you up?
That stinks! Were you able to get the stain out?
Was the date at least good?
That sounds like good news and bad. I hope you will be going with him someday. :)
Sometimes our best life experiences are after we make big changes in our life. It sounds like a fun adventure to me. :)
Rain is relaxing to myself_comma_ odd 
That's annoying! The weather team has one job. Rain is so relaxing to be used for showering. 
That's a wonderful situation to be in. Are you planning to tell her?
That's understandable_comma_ but you won't know her position on the issue until you bring it up. Either way it's your call.
Oh really what movie?
I am so sorry.  Were you disappointed?
I love road trips_comma_ sounds like a good time.
Hope you have a nice trip_comma_ It's good to have things to look forward to. 
That sounds relaxing! What did you watch
Maybe I'll do that tonight!
Me too!
Oh no! I'm so sorry. What kind of dog was he?
Aww. Mine is getting pretty old. I'm not looking forward to losing him.
You think you will get another one?
Oh boy_comma_ I guess you'll have your hands full.
I could understand that. I don't like crowds so lol.
Thats good. Abusive relationships are the worst.
Great! You deserve it!
Yuck. Did you throw the remote out?
They have a mind of their own some days.
Did you get all of it done?
That's why I wear long shirts. You can work. and not offend anyone!
Mistakes are made_comma_ but still. I can how that would be annoying.
I understand completely. I would have done the same.
Wow_comma_ that must have been pretty challenging. Where you able to do it?
Oh man_comma_ that's brutal. So close_comma_ but so far.
That sounds awesome!  Did everything go well?
That's not too bad_comma_ I'm glad you had a good vacay and your friend is trustworthy!
Did you adopt an animal
I feel all for those poor animals and want to adopt all of them
It would definitely be hard.  I feel bad for them being in cages.
i am sorry to hear that_comma_ i know she will be better
before you know it _comma_ she will be out and about
I bet it was_comma_ I'm glad you are doing better now.  Did they find the person driving the van? Did they even stop?
Wow_comma_ thats awesome you were only in for a few days.  I guess I haven't had an accident that bad before but I would have thought it would have been a longer time period.  
Thats awesome_comma_ I am really glad youre OK now :)
Oh no!! Haha. The first days of school can be so hectic! But soon the routine will set in again and all will be good. :)
Oh I can imagine! Glad everyone is ok!
I would of did the same.
Did you kill it?
It was a very devastating storm.
I hope so_comma_ no one should have to live throught hat
How exciting! You must be so proud of him. What an accomplishment!
You definitely should be! Hopefully you took lots of photos!
Hahaha_comma_ that is hilarious! We have some mega spiders where I live. Imagine pulling some toilet paper and a huge spider the size of your hand comes jumping out. It happened to me!!
Yeah_comma_ they can help get the spider outside.
oh wow that is cool_comma_ i don't think ill ever purchase a new car. a good used one will be my best option! 
I have and infinity!!! its an older 2006 model i got it at a insanely good price around 4k
I watched that happen. Been thinking about doing some research on trading with bitcoin.
That's a good idea. I think there is alot of promise there. good luck.
Yikes! I'd have jumped too.
We don't have any roaches where I live luckily.
That sounds awesome. It's important for kids to know self defense and also to be active so all boxes are checked.
I may have to encourage some of my family to pick up martial arts. We never delved to the high levels and I see a lot pf value in the teachings.
that sounds great you must be jazzed up about it
you'll be great_comma_ i wish i was there to see it
Oh_comma_ that is terrible! Did you try to save the cat?
Ahhh_comma_ what a horrible thing to see in the morning! Hope your day went well after that. 
I've never heard of a hot water beach.  What's it caused by?
Was that the coolest thing that you did there?
Who are we talking about? I'm sorry you're upset. Maybe you could talk to her and let her know you need help.
It's okay. We all need to vent sometimes. Bosses are the worst people to deal with sometimes.
I bet it was! Did you end up finding it or did you have to cancel all of your cards?
Thats awesome!  I know stores will typically hold onto a lost wallet but calling you is going above and beyond what the norm is.
 i must have been terrifying_comma_ I am glad you both made it through it
its nice to have another to lean on when it happened
That is awful!  I can deal with dogs barking during the day but at night is no good.
I really hope they listen and can make some changes!
That must've been nice. I bet that reminded you a lot of when you were a kid. Did you enjoy your time with your mom?
Ha! That's awesome. The 80's style was so cool! 
That's really rough. Do you think he may have relapsed?
I would be too. Going through something like that can take a toll on anyone_comma_ and makes it hard to cope with everyday life. I hope he gets the help he needs.
Thats awsome hopefully he sticks with it. Its a chick magbnet
That's a great thing to have going for him!
Haha_comma_ yeah cats can be rude! I prefer dogs myself. They are much sweeter.
Oh man! I feel for you!
Was it a koala?
I bet that was pretty awesome.  How'd you grow your eucalyptus?
She sounds like a keeper
Well I wish the best for both of you
That's awesome! Did she have a good time doing the play?
I now the feeling_comma_ I always had stage fright as a kid. Hopefully it wasn't too tough for her.
Aw_comma_ you must be lonely. At least you have her pet with you_comma_ right? What pet does she have?
Yeah_comma_ cats are a little tricky. I think dogs are much more friendly_comma_ but that's just me! 
Oh man_comma_ that is terrifying. I'm glad you didn't get hit. What kind of crazy person tries to turn and change lanes at the same time?
I know that feeling_comma_ I see that kind of stuff all the time where I live too. I hope you stay safe.
Yes it is definitely difficult to change doctors.
I definitely understand.  My doctor is not super close either.
Yeah_comma_ did something in particular make you feel that way?
Wow_comma_ that's awesome! Good for you guys_comma_ I hope you have many more happy years together. :)
Aww_comma_ I'm sorry. That's a tough one to go through. Mine had the same.
How old is she? I remember mine couldn't remember me me but I could still make her laugh_comma_
you will regret not going I think you should go
see you made the right choice and you will always be glad you went
Wow_comma_ thats cool. What did you do?
Oh! That's something to look forward to then! decide what your gonna do? 
Cool! that's what I always do on my birthday too! LOL
cool! are you going?
Keep Mturking brother
Nice!  Is that a perk of your job or did you have to use a vacation day?
Thats so awesome_comma_ is it coming up or is that something they offered when you took the job?
What's the movie? I love watching new stuff.
I'd love to see that. I was a big fan of Winnie the Pooh growing up_comma_ so I bet I'll love it.
Aw dang_comma_ that must really be pain for you. Have you talked with anyone else about this? I'm sure other people are having problems with this coworker also .
Ohhhhhhh_comma_ yeah that's really hard on everyone then. Taking it to corporate would be a good idea to help the company and the workers_comma_ if you need to vent out any more frustrations_comma_ just let me know!
Oh yes! I really hate that. It has happened to me more than I like. Did you get a refund at least?
Did you get a refund at least?
Oh no_comma_ that is so sad. I am sure it would of meant a lot for you to be there. 
I understand_comma_ funerals can be heartbreaking. But it gives you good closure! 
Congratulations! That is always a great feeling! A reward after such hard work. :)
This is very true and what all the great thinkers out there preach! 
It can't hurt to try_comma_ might as well give it a shot_comma_ right?
The worse they can do is not hire you_comma_ gotta put yourself out there. best of luck!
Do you run into this issue a lot?  I could imagine grocery shopping to be a nightmare
Does online shopping make it easier?  I would think maybe it would relieve some stress if you could do it from your house
I do!  It grosses me out_comma_ even when it's my own.
I completely understand.  Hopefully the manager was able to take care of it for you!
Oh no! So I guess you had to stay that way til you got to go home?
Well_comma_ I'm glad you didn't hurt yourself at least.
That's just disgusting!
I'm glad you were there to show that people still care.
It happens to everyone_comma_ being tired makes people so irritable. Being a mom is tough as it is.
Just give him a big hug and let him know how much you love him_comma_ and I'm sure all will be forgiven! :)
I bet you've had to do a lot of prep work.  Do you feel ready?
What day do you leave for the trip?
That's very inspiring. How has it changed your life?
Yes_comma_ I think everything in life happens for a reason and we can't change that. I'm glad you had your breakthrough!
What made you want to be a nurse?
That's good_comma_ it's a lot of work_comma_ sure you are ready for that?
Oh wow. Did you not want to go?
Lol. Aww. I hope he is back now. Mine no longer lives with me and I kind of like the quiet.
Did you have to get it pulled?
Do you feel better now that you got it done?
That's awesome_comma_ I haven't been to a concert in ages. Who is the band?
I hope you have a great time! I should try and see a show soon so i can be cool like you.
How do you feel about that?
Aww! You must feel lonely. Is he coming back soon?
Those must have brought back some great memories.
I haven't watched any old videos in a very long time_comma_ I'll have to see if I can find some next time I'm at my parents.
I have heard the same thing from my friends who have kids!  They say it's like a force takes over as soon as the baby is born
That has to be a very powerful feeling.
do you think they are up to something?
You should be careful about jumping to conclusions. 
That's nice_comma_ pretty rare to have good neighbors these days it seems!
You should have a beer with him or something to show your gratitude!
Uh oh. Is he better now?
OK_comma_ good. What do you think caused the infection in the first place?
Is he a baby? I heard it happens often.
Aw_comma_ that's so sweet!  Do you see a future together?
I really_comma_ really hope it works out for you guys!
That had to be rough_comma_ and glad to hear you're better. Do you have any follow-up appointments to go to?
Well_comma_ at least you have some relief for now.  I hope that it stays in remission.
Hey_comma_ good for you! That takes dedication. I admire that. 
Losing a few pounds has such a positive effect. You must feel better too. I need to get on that!
That's really exciting for her!  But I'm sure being apart will be difficult for both of you.
Hopefully she isn't too far away for you to visit often!
Man_comma_ that really stinks.  Did insurance pay to repair your floor and cupboards?
When will your house be put back together?
I'm so sorry to hear that.  Death is not an easy thing to cope with.
It's a difficult way to realize you should live every day to the fullest potential.
How exciting! first time there?
Whats it like? I have never been there. 
Sailor Moon~!  That was the best show!  I've shared it with my kids_comma_ too.  And the laugh at the picture of me dressed up as Sailor Jupiter from loooooong ago!
My girls think I'm the coolest because I watch Sailor Moon and Dragonball Super and a ton of other anime and I'm like_comma_ "I've been watching stuff like this since before you were born!"
That's good!  I've got the ones that like watching anything about space.  The older one wants to be on a Mars mission!
Oh_comma_ man. Did you end up falling?
Ouch.  Did you get bruised up?
I'm sorry to hear that she passed away.  Had she been sick a long time?
Wow.  I hope she wasn't in any pain.
I think most people have been there.  Its tough disappointing your parents and even worse when you know you could have done something about it.
I got some bad grades in college and told my parents I was doing better than I was. I know how ashamed I felt at that time too.
How much money are we talking?
Fair enough. $100 can be made easily; a watch with sentimental value is priceless.
Hopefully_comma_ your hard work payed off. Where the finals hard?
I agree with you. Hard work tends to give the results in the end.
Oh_comma_ lucky! That is one of my favourite places on earth!
Did you enjoy it once you got there?
It really is. I've been to both disney world and dsiney land_comma_ I think I prefer disney land. 
I know but it feels more....authentic or something!
That's really bad_comma_ what are you going to do?
Well at least you have a safety net. 
That's got to be exciting!  [And as a parent_comma_ I salute you!]  What grade do you teach?
Oh_comma_ wow!  That does sound fun!  Just for the idea of eating in class every once in a while!
What sorts of things do the kids learn how to make?
I wish they had that when I was in school in 199*coughcough*  :)
That should be fun! Do you go every year?
very cool! That's awesome you have that opportunity to do something you love every summer!
Yeah_comma_ lawn mowing sucks!  Do you have a large lot?
Maybe that riding mower would be a worthy investment?
That sounds miserable. 
Why didn't you ask her to begin with?
That's good!  Was there a reason for the suspension?
It'll be good for her to have your support_comma_ so hopefully she'll do better this semester.
Oh my god what happened?
Did it get on him?
Wow_comma_ I'm sorry about getting fired_comma_ but it sounds like you've got guts! How do you like the business?
Oh that is so great. So many people fantasize about doing that.  Congratulations!
Oh cool! Have they arrived yet?
Yeah it
I love scary movies!  What was it about?
I love her!  I'm definitely going to see it_comma_ thanks for the rec!
Yeah I hate when people do that. It can ruin things.
Friends come and go in life_comma_ it's up to you to determine if you want to reconcile with this person or not.
Oh my. You are brave.  Thank goodness they didn't break.  Did you mom  know what happened?
That's good. My mom would freak
Sounds amazing! What kind of art does she want to produce?
Wow. Sculpture. Very impressed. 
Is it that time where you live? How do you prepare?
Wow. that must make you nervous. Where do you live?
What is the secret? 
That's something she should know. 
Thats awesome_comma_ were they for school or for fun?
Thats awesome! Theyll come in handy on those rainy days or nice relaxing days!
your are torn between him being a man but you still think of him being your little boy
you will enjoy it as he grows older because you had a hand in it and know that he will be prepared for it
OMG that sounds awful!  Was your friend upset?
Nah_comma_ if they were understanding it's all good!  Everyone has a little too much from time to time.
He must have saved up quite a bit for that. They're pretty expensive
Being frugal is always a benefit in the long run. I suggest doing online surveys to make some extra cash  ;)
That's great!  How many dogs do you have?
Awwww!  That sounds so fun!  And they sound like such happy little guys!
Nope - school started for the kids today!
This is the earliest they've ever started here.
Oh that sounds amazing! were you a little jealous? Did they have fun?
I completely understand. It does sound amazing though!
I know what you mean. We are only lucky enough to travel local.
Oh no! I am so sorry. That is really tough.  
Did you get any feedback on what you could do to improve your chances next time?
Ah_comma_ that happens.  Again_comma_ very sorry. Maybe you can find the silver lining in it. Or_comma_ find a new job and get a fresh start somewhere else. 
Wow! That's a good deal- I wish I knew how to find that!
Aww_comma_ that's disappointing. Sorry to hear that. 
Aw I am so sorry to hear of your dogs passing. It's hard to lose a pet. We just lost our cat this year.
It will get easier. Hang in there!
It does. I just got a new kitten a few weeks ago. It helps to have her to cuddle with.
Congratulations. Is it for something that you're keen on pursuing a little longer term?
Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Still_comma_ onwards and upwards. I wish you all the best!
That sounds sweet.
Why didn't you?
They usually use their smartphones while driving_comma_ which is very bad for everyobys safety
Yes_comma_ we as a community must teach people how to drive properly without any risks
Congratulations!  That's awesome.  Sometimes it's scary to risk rejection_comma_ but it sounds like it totally paid off in this case.  
I'm about to switch careers_comma_ so I'll be doing the interviewing thing soon. It's scary.  
Why do you feel that way?
You sound a bit like me. I get lost in the details of things myself sometimes. I'm sure after you weigh the pros and cons of the situation you'll come to the right conclusion for yourself.
Aw_comma_ really? Was it a long time ago_comma_ or did you graduate recently?
I graduated a long time ago too -- 1985. Those were great times for me too. I feel sentimental about it.
That's so great! I hope you get the job - assuming it's one you really want.
Then keep your head up & keep reaching for the stars! Maybe this will be the one!! But even if it doesn't turn out_comma_ keep on searching. Your perfect job IS waiting for you. :)
You're welcome & best wishes with your job hunting!
Mine went back to school today!  I watched the bus drive off and I kinda looked around and said to myself_comma_ "Well shoot_comma_ what now?"
Mine are older and think they're too cool for everything.  I took my usual 'first day of school' picture and I got_comma_ "Mom_comma_ aren't we too old for this?"
When they're little_comma_ that's the best age for pictures - they'll never meet a camera that they don't like.
The same!  17_comma_ 15_comma_ [girls] and 10 [boy]
That's so fun! I've always wanted to get into baking. How did the cake turn out?
I bet you were so proud of your creation! I hope everyone enjoyed the cake.
I'm sorry. I bet you miss her a lot?
That must be really tough. I hope you can see her again soon.
Wow!  Where did you find those?  I remember watching that series as a kid!
It's so good to see old shows we grew up on coming out on DVD!  
You must've been really disappointed in him. Did you talk to him and find out why he did it?
He better be! Sounds like he's in the wrong crowd. Hopefully_comma_ he finds new friends soon.
You're lucky to have her! It's hard to find someone to trust. 
Aw_comma_ I'm sure you tell her. I hope to be that kind of mom when my kids are adults. 
Aww_comma_ I'm sure that's been nothing but positive for you. 
Moms. They are the best. 
Sounds like a great friend to have. Do you guys still keep in touch?
It happens to everyone honestly_comma_ I can relate. We will always have good memories to remember though_comma_ and thats what matters the most.
Sounds fun! How close are you to your target?
That should help with the cost then. How much money do you need to save?
Those are the most fun sorts of essays to write - and the easiest.  How do you think you did?
Wow!  Sounded like a real breeze!  What did you write about?
That is very kind of you.  Im sure the owner was very appreciative!
If I lost mine hiking I would for sure think it was gone forever.  Hopefully they didnt cancel too many cards before you got it back to them!
These things take time.  Have you met any of your neighbors?
Maybe you should try introducing yourself to your neighbors.  Or look online for meetups for hobbies that you're interested in.
Ah. that sucks. Long commutes are miserable! hopefully you do better at the course this time.
Yea those out of state fees can be ridiculous. Best of luck to you!
Thats really nice of you.  Do you feed them too?
Awww_comma_ have you adopted any that you brought in?
That's great!  How do you think it went?
With that kind of confidence_comma_ you should be a shoe-in for the promotion!
Aw that's wonderful! What kind of dog?
Oh nice_comma_ they can be so sweet and gentle. 
Lucky you! I wanna go there to.
It probably is_comma_ at least you get to experience another culture.
not really I kill everything
are they carrot flowers? 
really_comma_ did you tell them your secrets?
how did it make you feel to disclose that information?
Yes_comma_ everyone does. that was really brave of you!
i see you are a PS4 fan
i dont have a PS4_comma_ alot of people play fortnite. is that a cool game?
Oh yeah_comma_ many times. Not a whole lot of fun.
Wow. I hope you didn't hurt yourself!
That's exciting!  Are you hitting up one of the amusement parks?
I have always wanted to go to that.  I love Universal_comma_ and Halloween is my favorite holiday
Were either of the dogs hurt?
Your neighbor is very careless. Thankfully no one got hurt
really_comma_ what is the secret? 
wow_comma_ that is some secret. 
lol_comma_ right! she would defintely make world star. 
oh nice! first one?
I bet. Do you have any children of your own?
so that means extra spoilage :P
by spoil do you mean mountain dew?
Thats awesome! I was actually looking for mine the other day.  Were you looking up anyone in particular or just for fun?
I still see my high school buddies on a somewhat regular basis but it is a great time telling those stories over and over.
Ooh_comma_ sounds nice_comma_ Always good to see the siblings.
Hah_comma_ i hope you two have some fun. My sisters visited me a few weeks ago and we had some fun.
I didn't even realize they let you adopt dogs that failed the training_comma_ how did it fail do you know?
Wow_comma_ I bet it will be a really good dog then. Hopefully you hear something soon!
Uh-oh that's not good!  Did they understand?
Yeah you got lucky there for sure!
Nice!  Was he surprised_comma_ or hoping to do better/
That's great!  Which belt has he earned?
What happened?
Oh man_comma_ that sucks 😢
It's okay_comma_ there will be other times
That must have felt very good. And taken a lot of determination.
It's great to have friends in the classroom. Are you still friends with some of them?
That's good. Sometimes classmates can make all the difference_comma_ I agree.
That's terrible!  Are you repairing it yourself?
Can they be fixed_comma_ or do you have to get different cabinets?
No way! Thats awesome!! How old is your son?
I bet! Thats great news though_comma_ congrats to him!
Did you finally manage to find a house you like?
I remember how frustrating house hunting was.  Glad it has worked out for you.
Oh yeah_comma_ school year starts soon. Well I hope you'll have an easy year!
That's beautiful_comma_ looks like you've found a job that's fulfilling!
That happens_comma_ you have to acknowledge mistakes to learn from them.
Oh well that seems improper_comma_ you should bring it up to her supervisor.
I hear that.  I can't afford all of them_comma_ but I have several.  Nintendo forever!
I haven't got that one yet_comma_ but once I have a bit of spare cash I'll look into it.  
Oh no. You must feel apprehensive. You forgive yourself?
Good. We all make mistakes. It's the human condition. 
That's really nice. Did it make you recall any memories you had forgotten about?
I'm glad you have something to remind you of them!
That's so stressful.
Yes it does. The DMV has the longest wait times. You go in first thing and already have a 45 minute wait from the get go. 
Sometimes it can be hard to be patient_comma_ I can totally relate to that. Not sleeping well can make you really irritable sometimes.
I hear ya_comma_ Don't be too hard on yourself though. being a parent can really test you! I'm sure you are doing fine.
are you excited to get back to work?
I'm sure the students are nervous about meeting their new teacher as well.
That must be very challenging to deal with at times.
I can understand being emabarrassed by that as well.
You must be excited! Are you a huge fan?
Sounds interesting. I do a bit. Not an avid fan though.
Well that must have been nice!  I assume you wanted it and not something different?
No that sounds great_comma_ I don't go to the same places enough for that_comma_ maybe I'll get lucky someday!
i hate when coworkers fight_comma_ it is so uncomfortable and you don't want to take sides
i do not know what to say_comma_ i guess the best thing to do is let them work it out on their own
I love to look at photos
What is your favorite memory of your birthday?
Sounds like a lot of fun.
I like to go out for dinner.
That's not something that should be done in a meeting. If they're going to argue it should be done in private.
Do you know if they managed to work things out?
Oh no!  How terrible.  I hope no one was hurt.
That is horrible.  I can't even imagine.
No_comma_ im 20 years old. Dont plan on having kids for another couple years!
What's troubling about them?
Oh my goodnes that must have been a lot of fun! How long did it take?
I bet. I used to have a dog years ago and have had that happen too.
Really? Did you get up to see what made the sound?
Yeah_comma_ that noise would have scared me and I would have grabbed a weapon to. 
That's funny. 
What did you decide on?
That is a good thing to do_comma_ im sure you feel empowered because of that
Funny how that happens_comma_ isn't it? Any memories in particular stand out?
That's great that she's kept so many! I bet your family will appreciate that as time goes on.
What class do you teach?
How interesting. I bet you are super proud.
Im sorry to hear that do you have insurance to help you?
Yeah well im glad you atleast have that to help you
That's awesome! You are fortunate to have a mom like that
Do you live with your mom still?
Thats not good_comma_ Did he do something to you?
Im sorry but you should still never hit him. It could just make him bit again
Im sorry to hear that. Did you ask them why?
How did you hear about what happened?
Im sorry to hear that_comma_ how old was the pet?
Yeah that is pretty old for a animal but that is life i guess
Sorry to hear you had a wreck but thankful you had insurance
I think its wonderful you will not have any expenses from the wreck
That is awesome we need more people like that in the world
Yeah you are a very lucky person
What do you think you can do about it?
Busted thats good stealing is a horrible thing to deal with.
What happened?
Im sorry that happened. Did it atleast smell good?
Oops. What did you bet about?
I like to bet in the football pools at the bar I visit. I lose a lot though.
Im sorry to hear that. did you hurt yourself?
Yeah i can only imagaine
You know_comma_ I love cats but do you think it needs a mental evaluation or was it upset you were gone so long?
Well it sounds like it was your fault then I would attack you to if you left me at home all day with food! lol
I dont think I would do that. seems a little odd to me
Still that seems a little strange to do
Congratulations I know you must be very proud
Thats important these days more than ever.
no is it fun?
that is really cheap!
Was it your birthday?
What did she buy ya?
Can you see it from your backyward?
Im sorry to hear that. I dont like my neighbors either
Oh. Was it because she didn't trust you or you didn't trust her?
Well that is good. Not too many people trust their spouses nowadays. 
That is great_comma_ How far is he away from yoyu
Yeah that is pretty far
I love Vegas what did you like the best?
I would too. I like the light shows and magic shows
Have you found anything promising?
Well keep looking something is out there for you
ewwww
It smelled bad and you felt bad LOL
I do
Yeah but where i live snow and ice are not really a issue
Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. I hope you are feeling better. 
That's good. And your girlfriend sounds like a real keeper. 
Well maybe you should move closer to them?
Yeah the cold can affect us older gents in some odd ways.
Moms like to do that_comma_ they worry about their kids!
You should talk to her every chance you can_comma_ you never know when it will be your last. 
That sounds like sooo much fun! I want to get a hot tub someday. 
That is good. It's not good to be stressed. 
Im sorry_comma_ but you should still try to remain positive about it
I know_comma_ You just have to take it one day at a time
That is very odd_comma_ I wouldn't give them any of that information. He is up to no good!
Good call! I would of done the same thing. You can never be too careful! 
Man_comma_ I love when you can enjoy some good food from your childhood. It brings back so many memories. 
For sure_comma_ I miss being able to have my moms cooking. Now I am very far away from her.
That is frustrating! Most people don't know basic trouble shooting skills. 
Yeah_comma_ it can be hard to be patient with people like that. 
I would be mad too_comma_ you should demand him to buy you more!
Yeah_comma_ make him regret doing such a cruel thing. 
Yes it has been a very wild and wet summer.
I bet. This has been the most rainy season I have ever seen
Darn! Why did you have to cancel? 
oh my goodness! That is scary! I am glad to hear you are ok.
Oh no_comma_ that is so unfortunate and so unthoughtful of the other driver! 
Yeah_comma_ it shouldn't affect your insurance. Since you were not at fault. But who knows how the whole thing will turn out. 
That would be_comma_ I hope your insurance takes care of you!
That is good_comma_ it is nice to be proud of the work you have done!
Now you can relax and enjoy the rest of your day.
Its nice when family has your back.
Thats always important anytime your in a dangerous siyuation.
Oh_comma_ that's nerve wracking_comma_ the waiting_comma_ especially when you know you are good for the job.
Well_comma_ this is how you get some_comma_ but having to deal with situations where your only choice is to wait patiently!
Oh wow_comma_ was it scary in there?
I can't stand the haunted houses where things jump out at you
That is really nice of her_comma_ I wish I had a neighbor that was that nice!
I need to actually build a relationship with my neighbors. I barely even know mine. 
Congratulations! Is this your first ever promotion?
Cool! What industry do you work in?
I bet. I hate when a few people mess up a good thing.
Im sorry that happened.
Awesome! What brand is it? 
Neat! Did you buy it used or new? It's always a satisfying experience!
No they are not in my area anymore. 
Thats a shame they were one of the first stores I remember.
That's horrible!  Was the kitten okay?
Did you report the person to the police?
Oh_comma_ were you lonely? You must have missed him. Was he gone long?
My husband used to travel on his job a lot. It was hard at first_comma_ but I got used to it after some time. Maybe you can get your girlfriend to come over?
Was she mad at you?
Was she alone?
Oh no_comma_ is there any ways to stream it online?
That won't be fun waiting. But at least you can skip the commercials. 
You are very lucky. I wish I was with my family.
You are right. I always feel nostalgic looking at my grandma's old photograph
Oh no sorry to hear that _comma_ were you able to retake it?
I can only imagine. Its one of those things that would embarass anyone but it happens to us all at some time
Wow_comma_ it must be really nice to have your family close by.
No_comma_ my family is quite small. Is yours large?
Oh no! Did he make a big mess?
Did you have to teach him a lesson?
Neat! I invest a lot too! I have Century Link and it was up slightly today. Did any of your others go up?
Oh gotcha! Well at least it wasn't as bad as the crash of 2008.
Ohh cool! I am chief's fan. I don't remember that match. Who won?
Ohh you have a really good memory. I am very bad at remembering things_comma_ lol.
Congrats to your son/daughter! They grow up so fast
No_comma_ I don't. But I want to have kids someday.
Oh? Do you know what they're bringing out next_comma_ or will it be a surprise?
Why is that? Too soggy?
Please tell me you went through with it.  That sounds like it would have been an experience!
They've should have had similar feelings_comma_ so they should have been more understanding.
Ohh_comma_ i am sorry. How is he feeling now?
ohh_comma_ that's so bad. It was not even your brother's fault. I really feel sorry for him.
Condolences it is very sad to lose a grandparent_comma_ they are so special to us
Oh that brings back memories_comma_ my grandparents raised me. I am so sorry 
I bet that was scary.
Thats sad to hear. i hope he pulls through.
Ohh good for you! You are very lucky
I wish I had such a good co workers!
Wow. You must be proud of him. Congratulations 
I see. It was many years of work. I guess his classmates were afraid o him_comma_ not everybody is black belt so young. 
Yeah? what did you do? Do tell!
Price we pay for beauty...I bet you looked amazing!
Why did you hire a new money manager?
Yes I do. What was wrong with your old money manager?
It's important to be ready for one of the biggest events in your life!
Good thing you were prepared_comma_ I would have been extremely anxious.
I understand. But think there will be many new people_comma_ so you will not be the only one in the same situation
What are your favourites options? 
did you make a dish with meat and/or dairy? 
oh no_comma_ did that person get mad at you for that?
How embarrasing!
Wow I dont even know what to say about that. HMMMMM
I bet you miss him a lot?
Does he visit you during holidays?
aww_comma_ any reason in particular?
that is so exciting! good for him!
Oh_comma_ no yeah starting new things can get me all anxious as well. What were you most worried about? 
Yeah_comma_ I understand what you mean. I hope that they provided you with some training on the first day to help you get used to the new environment and have an idea of what to expect at the workplace.
That's awesome. How many axolotls do you have?
What made you interested in having axolotls as pets?
sorry to hear that_comma_ how is she now?
it can be worrying sometimes
Oh no_comma_ I hope that you guys were sober enough to make it there safely! 
Wow_comma_ I am really glad that you two made it back safely. 
That's sad to hear. What happened? 
Oh no! I'm so sorry_comma_ that must be horrible. I'm glad that you have the support of the community. I'll keep you and your family in my prayers.
Why strange_comma_ its one of the happiest moments
memories can give you mixed emotions sometimes
Wow that must have been a treat for you to finally be able to get some alone time all o yourself! That was also very kind of you husband to do.
That is awesome_comma_ I know how challenging it can be to get some alone the especially when you have kids and there is no school in the summer!
That is great to hear! What is the achievement that you consider to be your best? 
Oh wow! Congratulations_comma_ that's amazing! Is your husband also a dancer?
That is super romantic! That's cool that you guys have a shared passion for dance.
Oh no! Why do you feel embarrassed?
Was the man nice about it at least?
That's great!  Have you ever met?
that's exciting.  
You found nice memories. Yes. I finished high School 14 yrs ago. What about you?
Awww_comma_ that is cute. Is she married already? or are u married with someone else? 
Ah what happen to you
Be careful please do it carefully
I don't fully understand that. I show some passion in my style.
Well_comma_ that's great. I hope that you show a lot of passion in your style_comma_ maybe with bright colors.
I'm sorry to hear that he passed away_comma_ but I'm glad that you have good memories of him.
That is heartwarming. You are lucky to have had such a loving grandpa!
That is great! Are you not looking forward to it as much anymore? 
That is great_comma_ I bet you had a great time because it is always nice to be able to "escape " for a week and just relax! :) 
Good luck! What will you use the money for if you win?
That's awesome. You could probably get a scholarship and go back to school for free though
Oh no_comma_ why do you think that? 
Aww_comma_ I hope that you two were able to discuss about what happened and how it made you feel. He may have not realized that he was doing that because there may have just been too many people there.
Oh_comma_ no. What?
Eeewwww!! I have never seen that in real life_comma_ but just the thought is super disgusting!!
Me too! Do you see them in your home often?
Are they not afraid of spiders?
Why is that? I Too have had some not so good feelings lately ;(
Oh dang_comma_ Did she eventually find a ride?
Hopefully she doesn't blame you. Does she?
Oh no_comma_ would you like to talk about it? I really hope that you are alright. 
Oh no I am so sorry to hear that. I wish you all the best and they are probably in a better place :) 
Dang_comma_ i can relate. Have you researched other wifi providers?
I understand that. its crazy how our tax money paid for them to improve that and they never did.
What you did is good. They need a lot of help. Not only money_comma_ but also emotional
it is good idea. You will be happy helping others. 
Onc or twice but i try not too often_comma_
You are very trausting. What happened?
What did you do was it embarrassing?
Goodness that must have been terrible_comma_ you shouldn't be so trusting of others.
Good job studying. how did you do?
Congratulations! Tests are always hard_comma_ it feels great when you do well.
Oh_comma_ wow! Congratulations to him!!
It sounds like it! What kind of a job is it?
Oh man_comma_ that's rough. Maybe after he works there for a bit_comma_ he can put in a good word for you.
Awww. : ) What secret is this?
I will always be here for you. Secrets are for sharing with someone you trust.
You are such a good and patient person_comma_you must really love him
I am such a lucky guy to have a friend like you
That must have been exciting. Was your friend much changed?
It is always good to see old friends after years of separation. It makes us nostalgic.
Flirting is fun. women enjoy it a little more than men do_comma_ I believe.
Good. MThat can be devastating.
That's so sweet. What kind of dog do you have?
That's a relief. Is he usually difficult to walk?
Oh my God! Are you ok?
Good! Life is unpredicatable and on the road_comma_ its not how you drive it's how other drive.
Oh my goodness. Are you okay?
I'm glad you're safe and the car can be repaired. Let the insurance companies deal with it.
Sounds like a good firl. how old is she?
Girls can be tough at that age. You are lucky ;)
Congratulations on your graduation! You must be so proud.
It's nice to have supportive people around you. It really builds up your confidence.
How old were you?
Nah_comma_ most kids that age are just trying to buy candy. it's much worse when you know fullly what stealing implicates.
You should_comma_ dont worry about it :0
Gosh. You must be anxious. How are you coping?
Can I do anything to help? Maybe bring a few beers over and we can watch the game?
I know exactly what you mean. Achievement and productivity then rest and relaxation provide a certain level of contentment.
Glad I could relate my friend. Enjoy the rest of your day.:)
That is so great to hear. I hope to be able to say the same one day.
I am hopeful that I will achieve that. Hopefully soon.
Well_comma_ it will get better. Life happens all the time. We have to just accept it and move on.
We all have embarrassing moment. We just have to just laugh and keep on.
Why don't you two play chess together anymore?
I'm sorry to hear that. I can only imagine how precious those chess matches were to you. I bet you look back on them fondly.
Wow that sounds like fun! It does take a lot of planning but it is so worth it.
I am so jealous! I hope you pack lots of sunscreen.
That's very sweet. My daughters do that too.
Yes_comma_ it is. They can be very helpful when they want to be.
Oh_comma_ dear! You must be anxious for your colleague. I really hope everything comes out alright.
You are a good and caring friend. She is lucky to have you.
I totally get that. My sister does the same thing. It's hard not to feel envious even if you have a good life.
I have friends like that too. To be honest_comma_ I have dropped friendships over this. 
So i safely reached home.
I know what you mean. In time you will be able to ride again.
Have you thought about getting therapy?  Sometimes_comma_ it will speed the process of healing.
Yeah_comma_ it will not hurt. Can you go for walks instead?
That sounds like fun. Sometimes its good to get away without the kids. I'm sure they are having  a blast at grandma's house.
I hope you guys have a good time and are able to reconnect with each other in new ways.
That's awesome! It's great to work hard_comma_ especially when you people show they actually appreciate what you do. 
Exactly. I feel like that's one of the best feelings. 
That's so sad. did you apologize to her?
Forgetting is part of human nature. I'm sure she'll forgive you eventually.
I am afraid of water too. I somewhat know how you are feeling.
I would be afraid of alligator. The water has so much pollution in it. But_comma_ then again we can't worry about things.
That's awesome. I bet she is so excited.
I can see where you would be shocked. I'm happy for her. 
What wasn't a good experience?
Tell me more_comma_ what happened with your friend?
 i can imagine how they felt
i hope they didn't get mad at you_comma_ some  things like are so precious 
Congratulations! When is she due? 
I hope everything works out well for you! That is so exciting.
Wow. Your husband sound like such a sweet guy.
You're a lucky lady. He must be a really caring man.
You should ask them if you can tag along! I'm sure they won't mind one bit.
Will it cost a lot to go on a tour with them?
I think I have a problem with jealousy because it's starting all over again. What sort of dog do you have?
You're so lucky. I'm sure you've earned that sense of personal enrichment. You deserve it.
Oh that sounds like a blast! Did you go?
Oh dear. This sounds like a bad comedy movie. What did you do then?
Ugh_comma_ that's really rough!  You shouldn't feel foolish though_comma_ it could happen to anyone.
I hope you feel better soon!
Did anyone else see what happened?
Dogs can get crazy like that sometimes_comma_ I'm glad no one else saw it happen!
Congratulations!  Do you want to marry her though?  Don't jump into a marriage because it's what people expect. If you're happy as you are_comma_ just be happy!
Then go for it!!  Go buy that engagement ring and set up a beautiful proposal.
Wow_comma_ you must have trained hard for that.
I do marathons_comma_ too. Netflix. haha
I love dogs!  Did you find one?
Oh man!  You must have your hands full!  I bet you're having a ton of fun though
That's great news! I'm so happy for you. I've been with my wife for 15 years.
No_comma_ we had to fight through a lot of stuff. Just love each other_comma_ and always remember your not each others enemy.
Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that.  Want to talk about what happened?
Did they have major layoffs or something?  
im so sorry to hear that :/
Yeah i hope that she pulls through and finds a happy place during this bad experience 
How old is your son?
Thats a doggy for ya. Gotta love them though.
Ah_comma_ the love is a cowboys fan?
I mostly watch college but yeah_comma_ football is great!
I can totally imagine. Did you do anything to stop them from coming up?
That's a bummer! I've always found drinking a bit of water and then holding my breath helps a bit.
I agree. I think it is important for couples to be secure enought to be happy that way.
I have been reading a lot it really helps me relax so much.
Congratulations. Did you get a raise too?
Thats excellent. 
ahh_comma_ I know that feeling.  Did you have a stressful day?
I'll keep my fingers crossed for you!
Is your spouse jealous? Why did you feel you couldn't go?
It's a party with lots of people_comma_ not a private dinner. I respect and understand your devotion to your husband though.
I am so sorry to hear about that. It is very hard to lose a loved one but treasure the memories of that person_comma_ especially the good memories. 
Oh dear_comma_ I can only imagine please stop blaming yourself. I feel your pain.
I stay home on black Friday. Too many people for me.
I'm sure you will have fun.
It is such a wonderful thing to have a mom who one can depend on.
I wish my mom was still alive. Just make sure that you show her how much you appreciate her. Even though you were upset because you had to work look at the bright side.
Oh yes mothers make our lives much better and gives us a new meaning in life.
And also be thankful that you have a job
Were you hurt?
Wow! Did you have to go to the doctor?
Was anything broken?
I'm sorry to hear about that.
Did this cause trouble for you at work?
It's good that you don't let others bring you down.
Just remember things happen for a reason. When one door closes another one opens.
Just stay positive and always be thankful.
It's good that you're confident. What subject do your exams cover?
Oh_comma_ sounds difficult. Good luck.
If it is a treasured gift_comma_ your friend should not be asking for it! how did you feel when she did ask you? 
Did she understand when you gave her the reason you didn't want to lend it to her? 
She doesn't sound like a good friend to me! 
That can be very stressful. I hope you did well.
I might try listening to some calming music. Stress can have a negative impact on your health.
Who is Janie?
Aww that's great_comma_ dogs can be so loving.
That must be really hard to deal with.   have you tried an aluminum free deodorant?  It helps me 
I am sorry you have to deal with that.   I am lucky because I don't sweat that much.  Can't imagine having to deal with that.  I hope you find something that can help you
I just moved to a small town and we don't have a Dairy Queen here. I used to go to one where I lived before.
It was always clean with quick service. The workers were always very friendly also. I miss that about my hometown_comma_ people are much more quiet and keep to themselves here. Are you originally from there?
Have you ever thought about moving to a different city/state? Do you think you would be happy someplace new?
I think i would like to move eventually_comma_ but for now i'm barely learning how to be independent_comma_ i started abusing drugs at age 14_comma_ now 15 years later im barely starting to "grow up" almost a year sober now. hopefully within the next few years I can experience that!
I really do like it here_comma_ my city isnt quite urban but its not rural either_comma_ Harlingen TX_comma_ cost of living is pretty low here and i think the weather is always nice.
What is your favorite Christmas memory?
That sounds like a pleasant time.
That is so incredible!!! Does he make a lot of money doing it?
That's so awesome.  How old is he now?
That is great. Not too many children are grateful of their parents. 
That's great! They sound like they are very good parents. 
Wow!! That is amazing! Good for him. You must be really proud and you have every right to be! :) 
I bet he is! :) 
I can relate_comma_ feeling lonely isn't a good thing. How are you coping with it? 
Losing the companionship of a friend really changes your routine. I'n sure you'll find another friend and you won't be lonely.
Wow_comma_ yeah I can relate. Being really high up is terrifying_comma_ but at least on a roller coaster it is only for a really short and fast period of time! 
Haha_comma_ yeah that is great! I am glad you enjoyed the thrill of riding one :)
I am great! HOw are you doing today?
WHy?!
Oh that is so great.  Is this her first?
I'm sorry for your loss.
She sounds really wonderful. 
That is extremely sad. That must have been difficult.
How old were you at the time?
What a strange place for introspection! What did you learn?
Wow that's pretty fundamental to your personality_comma_ and a great thing to discover. I imagine the knowledge will help you throughout life.
Wow testing that is hard. Glad you enjoyed it.
A "U" grade? yeah that's one that needs explaining
Very cool_comma_ was it for a high school reunion?  Hopefully it brought up good memories!
Awesome!  Hopefully you gave them the motivation they needed for the new year!
oh no! what are you going to do?
Oh man. Good luck!
I hate it when that happens. I don't feel like it is necessary to flake_comma_they should be sure before they lead people along.
That's completely reasonable considering the distance you had to drive for no reason. hopefully another interested buyer pops up soon.
Aww what a bummer! I am sorry to hear that_comma_ there are plenty of more jobs out there though_comma_ keep trying!
That does make such a difference_comma_ a job that you enjoy
That's great! Where did you get it from?
Is there somewhere special that you are going to wear it?
That should be fun!
That sounds awesome.  Did you guys do anything with the day off or just hang out watching TV?
Strawberries in cinnamon roles?  That might be really good!
What kind of a car is it?
That sounds great! What color is it?
Oh_comma_ I am so sorry to hear that. That is terrible. 
Me too. That was very nice of what you did for that dog. 
That's great. How did she do by the end of the day?
Oh_comma_ That's hard work_comma_ School and a job. It shows good work ethic though.
oh was he trying to be funny_comma_ or was he just creepy?
wow that is somewhat disturbing! I cant understand how people get such serious emotions for famous people.
Oh wow!  Are you happy about the purchase?
I would be too! What kind?
I have seen things I can't explain. I didn't stick around to ask_comma_ I ran. But afterwards I was thinking it was a ghost. 
That's scary. I'm not sure what I would have done if that were me. What did you do? 
Wow_comma_ that's scary. And I would have probably done the same thing. 
Oh_comma_ I'm so sorry. How old was she?
Yes_comma_ It's nice that her struggle is over and she is in a wonderful place now.
Do you still draw? I was never talented in drawing.
Oh i bet! Why did you stop drawing?
wow_comma_ i do not know either to say_comma_ way to go or you better not
that's good to hear_comma_ and if your spouse finds out she would be proud and mad at the friend
Awesome! What happened?
I love days like that_comma_ with two gets that would be the best day for me as well!
That's great! Was it Kindergarten or Pre-School?
That's great! Did you cry when you took him?
That's true. When my kids went to school the first day_comma_ I just kept standing around until one of the teachers finally told me I could go...
It's good that your standing up for your marriage like that. A lot of people aren't that committed.
You are a wonderful person then.
Did it make you feel frightened?
That's a shame_comma_ but sometimes it is good to face our fears.
Oh no! Why do long? Did you walk?
That stinks_comma_ but I am sure you got to see a lot of nice scenery. 
Maybe he will understand_comma_ but just in case I'd make him a new one.
Don't feel bad_comma_ It happens to the best of us.
Oh_comma_ wow. I hate it when people do things like that. They should just be honest and upfront to begin with instead of causing drama.
I'm sorry it fell through_comma_ but hopefully you will find something even better_comma_ and bonus_comma_ you won't have to deal with her.
Yea I hate the wait for aid and all the paperwork. Hopefully it is resolved soon so you can ride comfortably.
Hopefully the car holds up. I think you are playing it smart by having realistic expectation of when aid will arrive.
Cool. What kind of instrument were they playing?
Maybe a ukulele? It's always fun to hear new music you like!
That's wonderful! It sounds like you really care about each patient. 
I bet! I bet that job would be a lot on your physically as well as mentally.
Sometimes things come up. It's hard to travel during the holidays. Especially if your friend has kids.
Maybe this year will be different.
Dogs are really the best aren't they? They are the greatest friends we can ask for.
He sounds wonderful and he sounds like he was a great companion and friend. :)
maybe you had a good reason to do this
i think he will fully understand and see it as no problem
Haha_comma_ did someone else eat the pizza?  Was that someone you?
hahaha_comma_ he may have been a little angry but I'm sure he got a decent laugh out of it.
Oh_comma_ no! That's terrible! Were you okay?
I'm so glad you were okay!
Why didn't you walk away lol
You should of try to let it out slowly.
Oh_comma_ that's terrible. What did you tell him?
Well that's good advice. I hope it worked out for him!
Oh no. Was it something that was in the family or was it something that you purchased. Either way I'm sorry to hear that. 
I'm sorry to heat that. That's something that can't be replaced. 
That's very sad_comma_ I'm sorry. I have had family members pass as well and it is never easy. 
That poor woman. Hopefully she is going to be all right. 
Really! Did you have fun? 
Oh no! That sounds scary. Some of the rollercoasters can be very well built while others are very sketchy
Cool_comma_ is there a particular country that you're visiting?
Were you nervous at all about the vaccines? Needles make me queasy. I've fainted a couple times giving blood and receiving vaccines.
I've never heard of it - what's it about?
So cute! I can relate to that on a fundamental level.
That sounds great! Did you have a good visit? I hope it wasn't awkward. 
Very cool. My own father passed away a few years ago. I miss doing things with him. 
Thanks. I just wish we had taken more time to spend together in his final years. 
That's awesome when that kind of thing happens. Are you guys together now?
Aww man. Well be thankful it happened sooner than later.
My brother just went thru the same thing recenly. He is so much happier without this girl he was dating. she was alot!
I think he has already. lol
Did you? Was it good?
That's great. I may have to try it out.
That's a great achievement! What book did you decide to read?
Neat! I am trying to find so good books to start reading.
Oh_comma_ no! That stinks!
Haha! It's good you could see the big picture in a stressful situation.
Well that was nice.  Do you normally walk?
Have you stayed in contact with the person that gave you a lift?
I could have took the day off_comma_but I went in anyway.
Yes it was
I agree_comma_ cheating isn't rewarding. 
I agree with that one hundred percent. 
Time flies. Does this make you feel sad?
It's nice to reflect on the accomplishments of out loved ones.
Wow! That's amazing! You must be proud! What is your secret?
You are so inspiring! Good for you!!
Whoa_comma_ that's pretty darn late! Did you ask her why she was out so long?
Well_comma_ that's frustrating. Hopefully next time she'll think more about how her actions affect you.
Well Happy early Birthday!  I hope you enjoy it_comma_ when it comes. 
A special cake sounds wonderful_comma_ and you're welcome. 
Me_comma_ too! Do you have a favorite team?
Yes_comma_ that's my favorite team_comma_ too! Yay!
Oh no! What happened?
I know how that feels_comma_ and anyone who doesn't consider the safety of others isn't that great of a person.
Speak up next time!
Oh thats scary. I've been there. Just give it some time to feel right. Home is where ever you want it to be.
Thanks_comma_ it's so true. I've moved around alot.
Yep! Dad was in the army.
You too!
Oh no! What was it?
Wow that must have been very shocking. At least you can keep it to remember her by.
my goodness i feel terrible
wow i hope it all works out soon
What? You think you might be in trouble?
Why in the world did you do that? I hope they never find out...
Ducks are really cute_comma_ especially babies.
That's very nice of you. The only downside I can think of is them doing a lot of pooping.
That sounds lovely!
What a wonderful time for you and your friend! 
That's cool_comma_ what was the deal for?
Wow_comma_ that does sound like a pretty good deal. Makes you wonder why it's so cheap.
Neat! What typeof music is the concert for?
Interesting! I've never hear their music before!
Did you visit one recently?
Where did you go?
That is awesome! I am so proud of your son_comma_ you should be proud as well.
I can just imagine how you feel. It is so nice when our kids make us proud.
That was nice of you. Is she feeling better now?
I am glad to hear that. It's so sweet that you were able to help her.
Did you pass?
I have a feeling you got it. 
Oh_comma_ no_comma_ I hope you're okay!
That's great! I hope things keep looking up for you!
Oh_comma_ that is so sad. What kind of dog was he. How long did he live for?
Sounds like you had lots of great times together. You will have to remember those while you grieve. 
I can imagine that would be very painful. Are you doing better now?
I'm glad to here that_comma_ I'm sure that moving forward after something as difficult as that is very emotionally difficult.
Did you get in much trouble? I was allowed to kind of run wild_comma_ so never had any issues with staying out till sunrise. 
It's sweet that she was waiting up for you. 
Wow_comma_ it sounds like a great time with him!
Haha! That does sound like an amazing car!
Oh wow_comma_ I'm glad you have gotten your self prepared for a big blow. I hope you stay safe.
Went through Irma last year. We sat it out too.
Where they able to cover for the other employee?
That's good_comma_ I know what it's like when you can't get a shift covered and your just understaffed and scrambling the whole day.
Congrats to your family! What an honor that is. May I ask the name?
Absolutely. That's nice you two are close
Oh_comma_ you must be so excited! I have a son in the Army as well and I love when he gets to visit! 
Yes_comma_ I am. It's so nice to see our sons sacrifice for our country. But I think they do it more because they think they are protecting us. 
Oh_comma_ no! Did she damage your car?
I can understand that. I would be extra careful if I was driving someone else's car...especially Benz!
my goodness so terrible
oh i bet i would have been too
Oh_comma_ no. I'm sorry you feel lost!
Awww_comma_ poor thing! I hope you find him!
No just go ahead and keep going.  It will be fine.
If they would have had you on camera_comma_ they would have already come after you for it.  I wouldn't worry about it.
Yeah.  You're smooth.  You can do it no problem.
So... was it cold?
I'm so glad your dad was there to help you. Did he catch you?
That's awesome! Dad's are the best!!
How  deep was the pool?
Oh no! Have you looked up the user manual_comma_ or taken it to a repairman to get it fixed/
That takes some real hard work to fix something like that. I am sure it came in handy for cleaning up that stain.
That is true_comma_ being able to fix your own stuff is a valuable skill to have. 
Well_comma_ that's understandable. How did it go?
It sounds like it turned out really great for you. Way to go!
Oh_comma_ I love caramel apples! They're one of my favorite treats in the fall. Did you guys make your own caramel?
Sounds just like my family. Caramel is so hard to get right on the first try!
yes. both good and bad. What happened?
Wow that's so sweet!!! I love that they didn't forget about you!
Who did _comma_ tell me more
well thats not nice I hope she stars treating you better
wow_comma_ that must have been a surprise and a joy for you
i can imagine it. no matter how old and grown your son gets_comma_ he will always be your little boy
Nothing like fresh veggies! What did you plant?
Mmmm...you are making my mouth water. Juicy fresh tomatoes are the best!
Oh_comma_ no! That must have been so scary!
I'll bet you were. I'm so glad you had a happy ending!
Hi friend! I am not sure who you are talking about. Who blew you away?
Oh_comma_ that is very nice! I guess he doesn't do that often if you were blown away. Seems like he loves you very much. :)
that is so nice that he trust you with such a keepsake
i'm sure sure was. was it a special occasion when he gave you the ring?
Oh_comma_ that sounds so exciting! What did you make?
Oh_comma_ sounds yummy! I love seafood. 
Oh no!  How did that happen?
That's horrible.  I hope you and your family made it out okay!
That sounds like a lot of fun! Did you discover anything new?
That's pretty exciting! I hope it sparks a lot of new conversations for you both.
Oh no!! That is terrible! Are you ok? Will your insurance cover it?
That is a scary situation! Glad that you are alright! Man you car though! What a nice car_comma_ it is such a shame.
Oh no!  Did he give you a reason why?
That's terrible.  Have you said something to HR about this?
I'm so sorry to hear that_comma_ Are you handling it ok?
I miss my father just the same_comma_ I suggest going and doing something you both enjoyed doing together. I find I feel closer to them in those moments_comma_ almost like we are still sharing them together.
It'd nice you have a memento like that to remember him by. Did he wear it often?
What a great thing to have_comma_ I glad you're able to keep his memory alive like that. :)
That's so nice! He sounds like a keeper!
I'm glad you guys found each other. He sounds like a nice guy.
Oh_comma_ I hate it when that happens. Makes you feel disorganized in your thoughts even.
Take a day and devote it just for the house. That's what I do. I always feel so much better the next day that's not on my back.
Oh_comma_ sorry to hear that man. Yeah girls are hard to trust these days. What's up with that?
You did? Wow! What did it reveal?
Wow! Good riddens to her! Haha
That is terrible! I hope no one got hurt. 
That's good. Hopefully your car got fixed as well. 
I'm sorry that is tough. What breed was it?
Aw! Life ends sadly. Have you thought about getting another cat?
I love doughnuts. Did they have them?
I envy you_comma_ wish I was there to have some with a cup of coffee
Oh yes my favorite. I hope you shared with others.
Awesome! I imagined he enjoyed it.
Oh no! Did you end up finding it?
Aw that's too bad. Sorry to hear. I lost my debit once_comma_ I don't think I ever found mine either..
Scary situation loosing a card...Hopefully you get your new one quick!
That's too bad! 
I'm sorry to hear that. That can be a hard adjustment to make. 
Everything will work out fine. Stay strong_comma_ you're going to find someone that completes you and you will see that it was for the better. 
That's crazy_comma_ I can't believe your dog survived. Did you end up putting him down?
That's really impressive_comma_ I'm glad he was able to keep living and supporting you.
That's great! What class was it for?
Wow! You must be very smart. There's no way I'd be any good at bio-engineering.
Oh_comma_ I'm sorry. I can image how you feel. My son and his wife are trying to get pregnant right now as well. 
Aw_comma_ that's so awesome! Congratulations! 
How will you keep them out? It must be something that you can do.
That's a good attitude. I wish you have better luck next time.
Congratulations! That's awesome! How long have you two been together?
Hah! That is a long time! That's so exciting for you though. I hope wedding planning goes well and is super fun for you!
LOL that sucks. What are you gonna do?
Hopefully he stays there and catches those rats!!!
Do your friends not get along with your brother?
Makes sense_comma_ it's hard to bring things like that up with friends_comma_ but if you explain your feelings to them_comma_ I'm sure they'll understand.
That's so great! What type of cat is it?
That's amazing! Maybe you can plan to see her more often?
Oh no! That must've felt awful_comma_ I'm sorry!
I'm sorry you had to go through that! I bet you find someone better for you anyway.
that's sweet. You guys must have a great relationship.
That's great. How long have you been married?
Oh nice! I need one of those! My couch is so uncomfortable. It would be hard to get out of a new recliner for me as well.
Ugh! It's cool that she got a double so you guys can sit next to eachother as well.
Nice that it worked out so well for you! What brand did you end up going with?
Wow_comma_ that's some high praise_comma_ I might just have to try it out myself!
Oh heck no! Were you able to get back to sleep?
Ew_comma_ yeah I would have been in the same boat. Did you go sleep on the couch after that?
I suppose it is_comma_ but I wonder if the fact that you studied might have had more to do with it?
Well I am glad you got a good score. And faith is not a bad thing.
 it is a good sign of positivity i guess.. 
yes.. only thing we should do is to be patience and the rest will be okay ..
Oh really! What did you do?!
Oh my goodness! Congrats! How long were you two together before you took the plunge?
Oh wow! I've been waiting for 6 years for mine to throw a ring on this finger. still waiting! lol
oh no what happened
well i had one that did that and he lived to 17 so there may still be hope
That's awesome. I've been to a lot of countries but would love to go to Italy. I am envious.
That's pretty cool. I hope you get to go back.
How exciting.   What do you plan on seeing while there?
I am jealous.  I love being out in nature
I had a cat named Barney too! We was a one-eyed grey tabby. What kind of ornament is it?
Wow_comma_ that's quite a long life for a cat. I'm glad you got to enjoy so many years with Barney.
That's not a bad response_comma_ how did the team take it?
That's great_comma_ Did yall win?
congratz!
That sounds bad. I know it wasn't intentional but what happened? 
Well you did what you were supposed to do. It's their fault for saying what they said. 
Why? were you mad?
Oh no! thats embarrassing. I hope everyone was too drunk to remember. lol
awe man thats the worst
thats really sucks
Oh no_comma_ that's awful!  What happened to your dog?
Sorry to hear that.  That must have been tough at that age.
That sounds terrible_comma_ but I'm sure it's happened to other people before. 
You shouldn't let one bad incident ruin water parks for you. You're probably the only one that remembers and still thinks about that incident.
What happened? Did you finish the project?
Wow_comma_ that sucks. Sounds like it's your bosses fault. Did he take the blame?
Well good luck with your future projects or your future job.
Oh no! Hopefully that is the first time that has happened.
That is terrible! Especially since it was the whole day. Are you planning to punish her?
Lol.  I love it.  That is a great way to remind her of why she shouldn't lie.
I bet she won't do that again
Help them move and then have them take you out to the brewery as thanks.
I don't drink so have a drink for me lol.    
Lol. Thanks
oh man. was just talking to someone about that type of thing. i had a pet dog who was hit by a car back when I was in jr high. i have friends who have recently lost their lifelong pets and i know they're still reeling to some extent.
i will indeed. thank you. back at ya.
Wow! Do you know what kind of car you're getting yet?
That's amazing. I bet you can barely contain yourself!
i am very good
don't worry_comma_ I think everything will turn out right and your fears will disappear
Was she wanting to go with friends?
I know_comma_ you just never know how she will handle a dangerous situation. I talk to mine all the time about things that could happen. 
pull what off?
wow_comma_ that is so nice. you both should be really happy
yes_comma_ you have to put forth alot of effort in order to see good result. good for her. 
That's a long time! You and your partner must really love eachother.
I hope I have that one day! I bet these next ten years are even better than your last.
It feels good to be in a new place_comma_ but the moving process sucks. Is it a new part of town?
I get that. My city is going through that right now too. I moved to the suburbs and love it so far.
hey_comma_ how are you?
16 hours_comma_ thats a long time
im doing well
what cause the AC to go out
Me too_comma_ it is to stressing
Wow_comma_ looks like you are extemely organized_comma_ no offense
That's good! It can sometimes be hard trusting others with expensive belongings.
That's great! Did she teach you how to drive?
Well_comma_ it is good that you did not marry him. I had a husband who cheated.
Consider yourself very luck. A leopard never change his strips.
I bet you were embarrassed. 
Sounds like you learned to knock on the door first lol.
Did you mean rain?
I like rain myself. We've been getting a good amount here_comma_ during the past month or so. 
We've had an uncharacteristically mild summer. I'm hoping it continues. 
thats horrible_comma_ divorce is the last result. 
are the kids old enough to understand whats going on?
i guess thats a positive. they can understand that their life will be somewhat different
I remember that too_comma_ it's interesting transitioning to a more independent lifestyle.
That's great_comma_ I imagine that you still missed your family while getting involved and having new experiences.
That must have been frustrating. What did you do? 
That made me laugh. And you are a great babysitter. 
That's terrible. Did you confront your friend?
I'm sorry. I hope you can work things out without too much drama.
Congratulations! Buying a car is a big investment. What was the first thing you did when you got your car. 
I happy for you. Buying a new car is a big deal. 
Oh no! Did they stick around to exchange info?
Oh good. At least they were responsible enough to that with you. I'm glad your ok.
i love meat loaf
sounds good_comma_ what made you go low carb?
ok_comma_ i do low carm too
You mean the kitchen staff?
I try not to think to much about kitchen sanitation when I go out to eat. 
Oh no! Do you have a suspect?
I hope it turns up_comma_ or is returned to you soon.
She's balling hard_comma_ I'm sure that her new toy will serve as motivation for you.
That's splendid and it should help you decide if you want an interior similar to hers or completely different in the future.
Awww. I'm sorry to hear that. Aretha means a lot to you I see
I'm sure. She was a very good singer. 
Aww_comma_ my mom used to listen to her too? Did she sing along and dance like mine did too? Used to love that when I was little.
Ain't that the truth! Miss those days.
Why_comma_ what happened? 
That's a present that you love and it can love you back. That's the best present. 
Sometimes it's good to face our fears_comma_ or turn on every light in the house.
I don't I think could quit without the satisfaction of knowing how it ends.
That's awesome. My wife and I will hopefully be in that same boat soon. Was he excited?
That's awesome. I can't wait to experience it.
but i bet you feel all better now right?
that's really good. Everything went okay?
wow_comma_ thats so awesome! make sure you take care of yourself
these months will fly by so fast
Yeah it might be a good idea to tell him. But you may want to have the money to give back to him first. 
Hopefully legal drugs.  But either way I think you should tell him and give him his money. But you know your brother better than me. 
hey that's awesome! You won't have to steal money like me. Which University was it?
Oh a Christian University that is nice. Well I needed my drugs
oh okay that's good. I should apply because of my diabetes insulin is expensive. 
Wow. Did the other person know what was going on?
Well that's good. Sounds like it all worked out pretty well.
That's good. I hope she found someone who treats her well.
That's really sweet. I bet your nervous though.
Sibling rivalries are unfortunate. Hopefully you two can patch things up one day?
Ah_comma_ i see. I hope you end up going and find a way to enjoy yourself. Family is all that matters in the end. 
That's great. Any specifics?
I'm glad things are on the right track.
Aw_comma_ that's sweet. What was it?
That sounds way better than the stuff I would try to make for my mom when I was little!
Oh no_comma_ how scary! What did you do?
I don't blame you_comma_ snakes are scary! Do you know what kind of snake it was?
Lol_comma_ yikes!!
Hopefully far_comma_ far away!
nice_comma_ its good to be organized before you go on vacation
i hope you have a good time
good weather is always nice while on vacation. you are so lucky
That is impressive.  Is he normally pretty handy?
Thats so awesome! I want to get to that point some day.
That's awesome. I'd be excited too. What are you going to get with it?
That's fun. I just watched that move this weekend. I really enjoyed it.
Is that uncomfortable for you?
Ok_comma_ well I hope it comes out ok for you.
Congrats! Did they just come in and say hey guess what you're getting promoted
That's cool. Guess all that hard work pays off!
I'm sorry to hear that.  Do they know what the issue with his heart is. 
That's good. I'm glad it wasn't something urgent and he got to finish in the garden. 
Did your team not do so good? I know mine sure didn't.
I like Chicago. How bout you?
Nice_comma_ I like them too.
That would make me sad too.  Was there any reason she took your friend and not you?
Lol_comma_ well thats rude! Hopefully you guys are better now!  Little grudges like that stink_comma_ I like to just put them behind me and move on.
Oh no. I hope that's not the end of the story. Did you find it? 
That's sad_comma_ hopefully it finds its way home. 
oh no_comma_ who messes up bbq
probably bad meat
Oh boy_comma_ was it someone you didn't want to talk to?
You can never be too careful! I've heard too many things in the news. Who did it end up being?
haha good for you!  Where were you?
I hope you get the job!
my dear thats gross
oh i bet
Yes that is annoying! How long did you have to wait?
Wow_comma_ thats no fun at all. I guess you could look at it as money saved.
Thanks! LOL
very cool! how old is she?
that's incredibly thoughtful! 
Is it a stray or a pet?
Well that's nice of you. Ive always been a dog person myself.
Oh me too. Have you been saving up for a good one this year?
Very cool. I'm looking forward to thanksgiving too. love turkey dinner.
Yes family is my favorite part.
ooh! I forgot about hot cocoa!
what changed your mind about the car
oh_comma_ i can see why now youve had a change of heart about the car. thats awful
i would have been horrified
Ah that is cool. Good to get it while he is still performing.
For sure. Not an avid listener_comma_ but definitely heard some of his stuff.
Oh no! Did anyone come over to help or did you try to get out of there asap?
One thing I've learned is that it might be embarrassing for a couple minutes but most of the time_comma_ an hour later_comma_ nobody will remember what happened.
I do love new sheets. The higher the thread count the bette_comma_
What thread count did you go with?
dang. Good job.
Whew_comma_ always a rough time. How do you think you did?
For sure. Were they hard?
Did you end up getting that job?
Oh awesome. I would have been nervous to if it was something I really wanted. glad you got the job.
Yes that's the worst. And I laughed when I read that. 
That had to be traumatic. 
Oh no! That's awful_comma_ was anything valuable stolen?
I'm so sorry! I would be so upset. Did you file a report with the police?
Close call! i would be pretty upset to lose my wallet. 
wow_comma_ lucky it got turned in with cash in it. Be more careful in the future! hah
Exciting! Were you nervous going in?  Did you take your test?
Congrats!  That had to feel good!  Hopefully you're happy zipping around the roads now (and safe too)!
That is very exciting_comma_ I bet you are nervous for your presentation. A lot is riding on it.
It is normal to feel nervous when working on something so important. I try to remember that it will soon be over. That helps me sleep. 
That is scary! Have you been watching the weather?
Rain can be such a damper. Make sure to be safe and carry around an umbrella if you go anywhere!
I'm sure if you can let people know that you're back blogging_comma_ they'd come back to see what you're up to now!  What do you blog about?
That sounds amazing!  I haven't played tabletops in forever.  The last one I played was called "Car Wars" and it was at a New Year's party.  It was loads of fun!
that is terrible_comma_ i hope you were not hurt
too bad about your car but the main thing is that you were not injured.
that is nice_comma_ family is fun to be around
i hope he gets it
Oh wow_comma_ I bet you were very scared. Guessing you found your way ok?
That's awesome! I bet you were glad those people came along.
Sounds like fun. When will you play?
Sounds like you will be well prepared.
Oh my gosh!!! That's pretty funny. Did anyone see what happened?
Thankfully you had a sweater_comma_ but geez how embarrassing. 
Girl_comma_ take that drink and don't be ashamed. At least you wouldn't have to pay for the drink!
That's when you say politely_comma_ I'll take the drink but not your number. Nothing to feel guilty about since you would be using your manners. 
That is really exciting_comma_ I bet it will be hard to let them go.
It is so exciting to watch them grow up_comma_ I am sure it will be an emotional moment. But it will be a good one.
Were you looking for something in particular or just for fun?
I bet it did! Were they photos of family or friends or all of the above?
That is awesome! Congratulations. I can just imagine how excited you were.
You made your coach proud and your family.
How many years ago was it? What happened?
Four years is such a long time! Its always the quiet ones you have to look out for haha.
I wish you both all the best in the future.
You must be really looking forward to that. Sounds exciting!
Oh yes enjoy the beautiful beaches and feel the sand between your toes_comma_.
Christmas is so much fun! Are you asking for anything in particular?
Oh wow! That's a big gift! I hope you receive it
That's great!  Congrats to her!  I bet she worked hard.
I bet!  She's going to have so much fun
really_comma_ that is awesome. you will have fun
start planning now
That is so nice to hear! You have a full house again! Did they have a good time?
Oh yeah! I hear you! A house full of kids is always crazy. Haha
i would have passed out!
i would have ran to my car! and hauled butt
Why? How much did you eat?
Wow! Was it good_comma_ anyways? Maybe you could buy more?
I'm sorry. I now that must have been a let down. Can you guys reschedule?
I bet you did. Hopefully you can do something with her soon.
I'm crossing my fingers for you.
Oh no! What happened? Did you get into an accident?
That has happened to me before too. The car started swaying side to side from the rear tires but I just took my foot off the gas and let the car do what it wanted until I was able to stop. So scary! I know how you feel.
Oh_comma_ no! I bet you were mad! Was she very sorry?
Siblings! You love them but sometimes they can be such a pain!
sorry to hear that
yeah_comma_ i love my little fur baby too_comma_ thats really makes me sad to hear that
That is daring! I do hope that you will win. What are the prizes?
Okay well. I wish you all the best of luck.
Oh no! That is horrible! Did you do anything?
Good for you! Animals need people like you! Very heroic! 
Oh yikes! Is your dog ok?
Awwww_comma_ I am sorry to hear that. That is a terrible thing to experience. I hope that you are ok.
I am so sorry to hear about that_comma_ treasure the memories that you have about your dad.
It is such a good thing to have to have people around who helps.
I am happy for you and hopefully things will get better.
Oh no! What did you do about it?
I can understand that_comma_ Hope he was able to take care of it for you.
Aw_comma_ that is terrible. Hopefully you did not have much money inside. I guess the worst part is all the cards that have to be replaced. So sorry to hear this. :(
Ouch! You know that you can replace all those cards online now. A bit easier than it used to be.
i agree with you on that one it can be very frustrating seeing that all the time
Yeah i agree 100 percent.  Its not a good look to make someone look perfect when in reality nobody's perfect
That's a big change_comma_ adjusting well?
Nice_comma_ sometimes a change of scenery is good. I need to move out of this crap state. 
haha I live in TN
Nice_comma_ i have friends there_comma_ i live in lavergne.
That is great news!! ...... but a little scary at the same time. lol
Well you have to let them spread their wings at some point. :)
Well that's a good sign. He knows you probably miss him and he wants you to know he's thinking aboutcha.
Honestly_comma_ worrying about that kind of thing is human. Literally everyone does it to some degree if they care about the other person_comma_ no matter how secure they say they are. So you're in good company!
Oh_comma_ have they done the draw for that yet?
Oh_comma_ you would have been so excited and then disappointed! I'm sorry!
Oh wow_comma_ I've never heard of a dog DNA test before. What is it?
That is so cool! Is it expensive to do?
I bet he does. 
Just sit him down and tell him.
Don't be afraid! You are smart. You are strong. You've had enough.
Good luck!
That is gross. Did you find out who left it there?
The old tuna sandwich.
Well hopefully you threw it out.
Maybe it tasted good as well.
Oh that's awesome_comma_ how come?
I hope you enjoy it! Where are you going ?
Amen to that_comma_ food is better when you don't cook it.
omg_comma_ did you hurt yourself bad
lol_comma_ i could imagine it to break the ice on your first day_comma_ you will always remember that day
lol_comma_ too funny
I'm pretty sure I've done something similar to that about a hundred times in my life_comma_ so don't feel bad_comma_ lol. He would probably laugh about it now if you told him.
What are brothers for_comma_ am I right? The absolute best response to something like that at least between siblings is just to get that sweet payback.
Was it a good one? Did you keep it?
Is someone getting married_comma_ or a baby?
Well tell them I said Congrats on whatever it is. As long as it's not a baby marriage.
Keep it secret_comma_ Keep it safe....
cross country_comma_ thats awesome
im sure it is_comma_ this is when you put all your hard work into play
yep_comma_ keep your eye on the prize
Wow_comma_ how amazing of your dad! We're you surprised? 
It sounds like your dad really loves you! To gift you something like that. :)
What type of cake was it. I love cake_comma_ wish I could have a slice.
It must have been very pretty and tasty.
Lightening and thunder has always scared me too. But rain is lovely. Especially in the spring.
Or how about on a tin roof? That is the ultimate relaxation.
Uh oh.... I'm afraid to ask_comma_ how did it go?
I lent my credit card to my sister one time and it did not go well. She still owes me to this day.
I am great how are you?
Sure_comma_ vent whatever you need.
Oh did you try them on? It's pretty normal_comma_ when my mom came home one day_comma_ she found me in her nightgown and highheels pretending I was going to her job.
Well_comma_ if you feel that's truly you be honest_comma_ and if they can't handle it find someone who can. 
Oh really?
Do you feel overall that you worked harder than he had throughout school?
I see. Do you have any resentment? Have you done anything to take matters into your own hands to get where you'd like to be?
That's great. It seems like you've only gotten stronger and that's an important trait to develop in life. Be proud of what you can accomplish on your own and your independance!
That's exciting! Are you happy to see him?
How wonderful. I hope you two have a great time together.
That's awesome! Is he a starter? I bet you were super proud of him!
Good grades_comma_ good athletics_comma_ he sounds like a model kid! I hope when I have kids that they turn out to be successful like yours. :)
Oh that's awesome_comma_ Was she paying it forward?
It's always nice to get unexpected good surprises.
You must've spent a while preparing. Did you get the job?
That's so awesome! hopefully youre enjoying it?
That's amazing! Where did you move to? Did you lose anything on the way?
That's such an unbelievably satisfying thing_comma_ isn't it? When you have JUST enough space to fit everything. I wish you the best of luck in Outdoorsman School. If I ever get lost in a National Park_comma_ I'm gonna be looking for you to come save me.
How commendable! Congratulations! That is a wonderful accomplishment.
Yes you should be. Giving back to communities is very charitable.
I live on a farm and take care of many animals. :)
Oh gross! Did it feel slimy?
I'm sorry! That would be unpleasant.
Are you going to adopt him?
I hope so.  I always want to adopt all the dogs in shelters
Oh wow_comma_ so it was extra money that was not yours?
I hope she didn't get in trouble for being short $20. 
Oh wow_comma_ that sounds super fun! What color?
I bet.  I can't imagine anyone would mind having a car like that!
Oh no! Sounds rough.  What happened?
Wow!  That surely is frustrating.  Did you confront him?
Good_comma_ he better not! Hopefully the anger will fade.
Oh that's great!_comma_ was it a surprise?
I'm very happy for you_comma_ I'm going to visit my mom next month actually.
I bet it was way easier and less of a pain that you anticipated it would be. Are you ready for the rest of your work week now?
Nice! Well then I guess you don't have to be as worked about those meetings in the future then_comma_ huh? Piece of cake.
Oh really_comma_ like what?
Oh man I super love mario kart!  I played it growing up a lot too.
What did you see?
Wow_comma_ that is pretty crazy! What did you do?
That's very brave. Did you run into any obstacles?
I'm glad things have worked out for you.
It's always exciting when you know a package is on the way!
I love eBay! I just found a doll that my daughter wanted for much cheaper than in the stores.
That is thoughtful. Recycling is a great way to help the environment.
Oh_comma_ that is a bummer. Oh well_comma_ everyone is entitled to do what they want
The hamburger? Those can be tasty.
Oh_comma_ well hamburgers aren't the healthiest things.
Why do you feel bad about it?
That's unfortunate. Do you have anyway of contacting the buyer now?
hey_comma_ that sounds wonderful. a puppy?
i imagine_comma_ all puppies are adorable and lovable
What did you see?
That's disgusting. I would never eat there again.
Oh gosh_comma_ What did he do?
Oh my god! is the child ok?
I hope you don't have to put your friend down_comma_ accidents happen.
How did it go?
Congrats_comma_ they can really scare you at the doctotrs.
Oh_comma_ that sounds like fun! Has it been a long time since you have seen him?
Oh that sucks! He doesn't sound like such a good friend I guess.
What happened?
Oh no. I hope it wasn't something dangerous.
Awww man_comma_ yeah the retail stores tend to change some stuff up_comma_ and sometimes it feels like you have to start all over again_comma_ but I'm sure you can push through! 
I'm glad it's not all different though. I'm sure the trainer will be really nice to train you because you sort of know what's going on_comma_ but just need a run down for the new responsibilities !
Well hopefully the 4 days did good and hey guesses are 50-50 right.
I think you did fine_comma_ even if you had to guess you probably made an educated guess_comma_ hopefully your subconscious remembered more. 
Did anyone try to bid against him? 
Wow_comma_ did he buy anything cool?
Haha_comma_ did you eat some ice cream?
Uh_comma_ oh_comma_ I think you might have been in trouble the next day.
Wrecks can be a scary thing to just miss. Was it the other persons fault?
Split second decisions save lives 
Thats cool. The N64 was a huge step up for enjoying your alone time for me.
I sold mine a long time ago and i regret it. :(
I should do that i don't know why i haven't
Done! lol
Oh no. Did they catch the person?
It's good that they were unsuccessful at least.
Haha bikes can be very scary. Did you lean the wrong why_comma_ i did that my first time.
Oh nice! He sounds like a cool dude. haha
Bike's are a lot of fun i can see why he would be into them.
Oh gosh_comma_ about what?
Oh no. So it was a horror movie_comma_ right?
Ugh. I hate horror movies.. I swear_comma_ I could be a grown 50 year old man_comma_ and still have trouble sleeping because of horror movies!!
that was brave of her
wow_comma_ she must be really good. to quit herself. 
Why is that?
Everyone feels that way when comparing themselves at those things. Except the pompous ones from school_comma_ those guys suck haha.
Ohhh_comma_ I am sorry to hear that. I know your pain very well. Are you ok?
That is good. It sounds like you were able to be with her before she left. She is in a better place now.
I'm so sorry to hear about your father. That's so awesome to hear about the support you received_comma_ though!
WOW! That's incredible! What an awesome human being
Anything you have in mind for you?
Well I hope your wants come to fruition .
Haha why is that? Do you already have too many?
Ah screw them. Live your own lives. 
Aw I hate when that happens. Did they have a valid excuse to cancel?
Well hopefully you can get together with them again soon. I know it stinks to get excited about plans and then have them fall through.
Yea being alone can really get to someone head.
Thats good! Have you thought about getting an outside job?
Well six months is a long time maybe you could get a seasonal job.
Haha that could be fun! Like a haunted house one.
My mom can too_comma_ What did she do?
Sometimes our mothers forget_comma_ that you are adult and thats not her child.
Would you?
Arent they all!
OH NO! Will he/she be ok?
OHH i thought you literally left her. Haha idk why.
LOL. Toots haha
That's awesome! I'm sure you are proud.
It takes commitment and sacrifice_comma_ hell I'm proud of your brother too! 
That is terrible. Did you complain to the company and get a discount?
Yeah_comma_ moving can be so stressful and expensive sometimes.
Oh my gosh! It isn't your fault!!!
I have ran over animals as well. It is an unfortunate reality.
Do they understand it was an accident?
It could be much worse. They could blame you and you would feel even worse. You should feel better with time.
Oh how exciting! Where are you going?
You are going to have such a great time and make memories you will cherish the rest of your life
You enjoy it a lot of people never travel so be thankful for the experience and soak up everything like a sponge
I would agree that you do_comma_ enjoy your trip!
Where did you eat? And what happened?
I hate when that happens.
That sounds like a good game to watch! Did you have your friends over?
I can imagine! Watching games can get wild sometimes!
That is excellent!  In what subject?
Wow.  That sounds like an interesting subject
Oh my goodness_comma_ that must have been embarrassing
I'm sure people looked away_comma_ it could have been them
O yeah what did they teach you?
O that is called a trust fall i think. it is used for team building
What kind of car?
Perhaps he's a meth dealer.
Well maybe you can too one day _comma_ I hope you do at the very least.
That's what my friends told me when we moved to Colorado for school. Free couchrides for life.
oh very cool. I have never been to Colorado. I keep saying i want to go but never do. Maybe for GABF in a couple years. Who knows.
i've heard that. i'd be coming north from Austin so easy enough to avoid cow smell :D
Thats great I have an excellent spouse as well.
Congratulations and thats OK I do that a lot too.
Pools are so much fun. You can even throw parties just because you have them!
Same. Sometimes they can be expensive as far as chemicals and maintenance.
Great news! You must be feeling pretty good today.
You should celebrate with a drink or a nice dinner out maybe
Where do you think you might go?
I have had that happen_comma_ did you run to the bathroom to fix it?
It happens but im glad you got it fixed. hopfully no one notcied
Did you have a good time?
Sometimes a party can be more fun.
I know how you feel. I have a brother I feel the same way about.
Thats not good. Have you thought about turning her in?
Did you getr accepted?!
I hope you are accepted. How do you feel as far as your application looked?
I wish you good luck_comma_ what kind of job is it?
Marketing is a rough business_comma_ but once you get your foot in the door_comma_ work hard _comma_ but dont let it consume your life.
I dont think I could do that its way to scary for me
It just seems like something could go wrong. You are a lot braver than me my firend
Sounds like your dog had fun.
It's good that you are able to discipline your dog.
sorry for your loss_comma_ why were you angry with him?
its natural to have those emotions
I bet that meant a lot to you _comma_ and him as well.
Well cherish them_comma_ and what they represent_comma_ and you will be awesome.
Why was she yelling at the cashier?
I feel a little bad for the cashier.
I agree. So many people are inconsiderate of workers.
Is he a reliable friend?
I am sure you will. It could take awhile but im sure he will make enough to pay you back. or is it a she?
Oh nice! Good man! You are a good friend!
I am sure that knarma is coming back soon ;)
That can be weird. Lots of memories.
Sometimes it's good to reminisce.

noone knew that you were moving?
oh_comma_ that has to be scary
here you are_comma_ killing it
How is the kid handling it? 
Tried and true_comma_ what generation of goldfish is this one?

That's really cute! Were they the same age?
My children are getting older
My son is fifteen. 
Oh yes. I actually ordered him a Lyft the other day to get from one friends house to another. I wasn't worried though. I think the system is solid.
What were they worried about?
Lol i think thats the 21rst centurl. its funny back in the day they said don't get in strangers cars.
Yea he will be fine.
Did you have a good time?
That's amazing for someone that age. And his voice was still good?
That's so sweet! What kind of necklace is it?
Neat! Did he find it while metal detecting? What a treasure that is! It had a double meaning to him!
That's quite generous! Cremations are expensive these days. I'm also sorry for your loss!
Having someone like that to turn to in times of need can ease the burden.
Oh nice!  What kind of toys?
That is nice.  Remembering childhood can be fun
He is a great play-writer. What do you like best? 
All great stories. I want to visit the Globe Theater sometime in my life. 
Cool! I like cookies! What did you have in snacks?
wow. ha ha. It's been a long time since I haven't had sour patch. I used to have it_comma_ when I was a kid. You seem enjoying your life ha!
Oh no! We're you okay?
Ha ha_comma_ you poor thing. Hopefully you feel better soon!
ohh_comma_ that's bad. But_comma_ you will be fine. Don't worry!
They just talk these things to scare us. Don't be scared. I am sure you will be fine! I will pray for you!
I didnt I was busy at work. Who won?
That is good to hear! Do you think they can do it again next year?
Did you end up getting them to for you?
Wow sorry to hear that. 
It's a big step for anyone_comma_ and can really make you feel like you have something tangible you worked for.
No_comma_ Where I live in Colorado _comma_ it would be the size of a match box for way too much money.
That is sad. Were you in the running for the job?
Oh. Well that makes sense_comma_I supposed. Still sad. 
You should at least clear the air with him so that you dont have hard feelings
Yeah but it happens and you should both try to move forward
Aww that is really sweet! how did her do it?
I think he might be the one for you!
Oh gosh. That's awful... sorry you had to experience that. What did you do after finding it? 
Aww. I wonder how he died.. poor raccoon. Even if they are sneaky little creatures_comma_ it's pretty sad. 
Did you go with her anyway?
I understand that.
Oh dear. Were you late?
That is sad. I hope everything turned out okay. 
Did you trip on something_comma_ or injure yourself?
It happens to everyone at some point_comma_ Ignore the jerks and know that they will forget about it for the next thing that comes along.
ooh cool! Did you win?
You did good! There is always a luck factor involved.
That's so annoying. I hate traffic! Was there an accident or was it just rush hour?
That's the worst. Where I live_comma_ there's insane traffic from 3 PM to 6 PM pretty much everyday! But people don't honk or yell_comma_ that's just being hostile!
Yeah were i live he had roads closed for weeks trying to fix everything
Yeah i hope we dont get another one of those again
Oh_comma_ I don't like surprises. What did you do?
Tough love works sometimes.
A few times before_comma_ but not recently. I do love Fifa the game though.
Well maybe next year they will fix the issues the club had_comma_ and come back stronger.
ohh good_comma_ and how did that happen?
Ohh that's bad though. Why don't you meet her?
Does his phone not work or something?
Well if you are really worried maybe call the police and have them do a wellness check
lol i bet it was good
sometimes it tastes better when it naughty
Congratulations! Are you happy to be done?
That's wonderful. I bet it feels great to have all your hard work finally pay off.
O yeah? What did you find?
O man I still have my furby too! I love looking at my old toys
That's awesome_comma_ I was in Chorus as a kid. Did she nail it?
Hopefully they made a taping of it for you to have.
That's weird. Are they friends?
Oh_comma_ wow. I bet you were upset. Are you going to ask him about it?
I'm sorry you are going through this.
Like the kind a cat vomits or came off of a brush? I'm hoping for you it came from a brush
Oh my goodness for a lack of better terms! I would be no good after that
Oh man_comma_ I hope everything is ok _comma_ and it was something mildly annoying like a tree limb.
My dog would of looked around like_comma_ wasn't me daddy_comma_ i cross my paws.
Somethimes that is good it keeps you on pace
Yeah but try to enjoy the journey that is the most important part
I like watching movies with karate in them.
Thats awesome. How long did it last?
Were you able to get all the things you needed in time
That is good_comma_ I need to prepare for this year it is going to be winter before we know it
i hope it went well for you.
That's great to hear. Did you accomplish everything that you wanted to in the meeting?
Congratulations! I wish you well with your new contract.
That's pretty cool. Is it a good deal or is it not worth the extra money?
Have you tried to look into other providers to see if there is a better deal available?
What food did you eat?
Oh that's terrible. What kind of shiver? Like_comma_ it was related to stomach problems?
thats a long way for a tat
wow thats great
Im sorry to hear that. What happened?
Thats a shame. It must have been a good play.
The wait is always the worst. I will keep you in my thoughts.
I hope its good news!
Oh no! Was it a spider?
Oh boy_comma_ that's even worse than a spider! Run!
That's terrible_comma_ I hope you apologized_comma_ or at least returned it and it was stolen for a good reason.
Well you should if it's weighing on you.
What was wrong with it?
Oh that's so gross! I would have sent it back too
Its always disappointing to not achieve something you were hoping for but it could also mean that a better position is in store for you.
I am sure with that attitude that you will move up the ladder very soon_comma_ much luck.
I am sorry to hear that will you still be needed for your job?
Thats great I am sure you will achieve success there.
What was it like I have always wanted to live in a dorm and go to colledge?
Well you should have why didn't you?
Oh no_comma_ you must be devastated. Wish I could give you a hug.
It's tough to lose someone you love. 
I'm so sorry! Losing a pet is like losing family.
You'll always have those memories of you and him together to cherish!
I'm tired but otherwise great.
Jumped out of an airplane?
Uh oh.  What happened?
Wow!  Are you ok?  Is she ok?
Omg.  I'm glad you're both ok.  That had to be scary.  She deserves extra love.  What a good dog.
I'll bring you both something special next time I'm over.  So glad you had her there.  Wish she didn't get hurt though.
Yikes_comma_ I had when that happens. Do you live with this guy?
Good for you! Get it done!
Congrats! how long have you been together?
That is kinda odd but im glad you are happy!
That's not fair! Does it go on your property?
I see. Have you tried talking to your neighbor about it?
Yeah_comma_ was it super cold?
I dont think I would have been brave enough to  do that
That's a big accomplishment! I bet your're proud.
That sounds like it will be so fun! I bet you all have a fabulous time.
Oh I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ why's that? :(
Can you go to the store and get some more before she notices? 
oh yea i do too i have 3
fat and sassy too
Sorry to hear about your loss.
Yes I have been in that situation. Just stay positive.
What happened to your car?
Oh yikes that's awful
Awesome.  You must be excited.
How long since you've seen her?
1What happened
O no I hope you tried to stop him
I bet they were in the last place you looked
Yeah that is usually how it goes
oh yeaaa do tell
ah snap!
Fast? Like sonic the hedgehog?
Oh no! We do need to hurry then don't we?
I understand sometimes it uncomfortable to socialize_comma_ I get anxiety in social situations
Sometimes its just a phase or maybe the group of people are not making an effort to make you feel included? I am sorry I know how that feels.
That is great! What is driving your happiness?
It's always a blessing to have certain times in life where no problems are occurring!
that is so sweet of you
i bet you had no problems_comma_ dogs are easy to take care of_comma_ they blindly accept anything
Oh boy_comma_ you okay? How does that make you feel?
Absolutely! Trusting your partner is so important.
How do you think they went? 
I hope so too! Good luck. :D 
It is annoying especially if in certain situations.
Absolutely couldnt agree more.
Wow that is so terrible. But you must've been really ill_comma_ I'm sure everyone understood.
Oh my goodness_comma_ I can only imagine how horrible that was for you.
Neat! What was the case?
That is a victory! Those pesky parking tickets can be a pain sometimes!
Im sorry to hear that. what did you decide to do?
Yeah that seems like the best thing to do
Being happy where your life is has got to be one of the best feelings. I'm happy for you!
It's all about what you do with those bumps and just pushing through them I think.
that's a bummer_comma_ i hope it was nothing serious happen to your car
that is good to hear_comma_  there are always kind people out there to help
Oh my gosh_comma_ I'm so sorry! Where are you staying now?
I can't imagine what you're going through. That must be extremely hard.
Ugh_comma_ thats the worst_comma_ especially when you just strictly looking. Were you planning on buying?
Yeah. Pushy salespeople are so annoying though! They accomplish the opposite of their goal when they become too overpowering over their customers.
o no_comma_ i hope no one noticed
Yeah i would not think about it to much.
That is good that you feel better! What happened to change your perspective?
I see! Well self-exploration and reflection is usually really productive!
im sorry_comma_ did you say anything to him"?
Yeah i would have yelled at him
That sounds fun.  I'm sure she knows you well enough to get you something that will suit you well.
That sound like a very useful gift that you'll use a lot in the course of a day.
i can imagine but it is good to get out
That is really cool_comma_ everyone should do something like that
thats so awesome congrats
my daughter just had her 2nd such happy
Was he any good or talented at it?
Well that sounds like fun to me.
That sounds fun how long has it been since you have seen her?
Yeah i bet it was a long long drive
I'm so sorry to hear that. You must be disappointed.
That's a great attitude to have! Positivity is always a great quality to have.
Hello! How are you.
That's an incredible blessing that they love you. Some people have different opinions about that so your lucky you come rom a supportive family.
oh no_comma_ were you polite to him? It can be pretty frustrating.
oh no_comma_ is there any way you can file a complaint against him? And it's the same guy?! So weird!!!
Yeah i have a photo album and every time i look at it i smile
Yeah i know but atleast you have memories of him
That sounds exciting.  Was there a prize?
That's hysterical!  It was definitely a unique prize then.
That's awesome. What do you like about your family?
Aw_comma_ that's very sweet! I wish I was that close with my family.
awesome
thats sounds fun
Oh wow! That's impressive_comma_ those can be really hard to get.
Congratulations_comma_ that's great! Hopefully you like the work.
Wow! What was scary about it?
Interesting! I bet live actors really enhance the experience!
oh man. That is not good. Do you feel okay?
I'm sorry man. You can reach out to me anytime.
 i hear ya there
oh boy
Oh that is wonderful I know that means a lot to you. It has great sentimental value I am sure.
I am sure it did and I know you will treasure that mug. Put it in a special safe place on display so you see it every day..
Oh wow. Good for her! Does she have a great job to afford such a great lifestyle?
I'm sure that much be hard to stand by and watch as someone who works hard for their things. 
I love Sonic! I used to go as a kid a lot as well. They have the best shakes.
I bet going to one again brought back a bunch of wonderful memories.
no idear who that is but im sure you liked it
thats great
That's an unfortunate situation. What's the diagnosis?
I see. He should probably get that checked out by a doctor. It's best to check out these things I think.
That is terrible to hear_comma_ hopefully you didn't injure anything more than your pride.
Well maybe your boss was one of them and you get some brownie points for trying to get to work quickly
Wow im sorry to hear that
That is awesome! Im glad it worked out
Are you tired_comma_ or do you have early plans tomorrow?
Oh_comma_ that's exciting! There is nothing like relaxing on the porch in the evening. 
Oh_comma_ that's cool! How many do you have?
oh myy
oh i bet
Sounds lovely! I bet it brought back a lot of memories.
Do you have fond memories of it>
That's so unfortunate. My condolences. Is there anything you can do to help?
I wish your friends mom all the best. A miracle could happen!
What did you do!
Yeah it must have been!
Oh no! Are you okay?
Ouch! That sounds painful. You poor thing.
Well it should be ok and don't feel guilty. Two cookies are not that big of a deal
You may feel a little guilty and I understand that_comma_ Maybe run to the store and pick up more?
Congratulations on getting that far! What position is it?
Nice! That is a good role! Do you like a leadership position?
That's terrible_comma_ what's wrong?
That's awful_comma_ I hope things get better for you.
Is it a good one?
Tell me.  I want to hear it.
That's no fair.  Your friend will never know.
Why_comma_ what's wrong?
And did it not go over well?
Were you able to find someone?
Well that's great_comma_  Someone you trust too.
That sounds so sweet_comma_ it's always nice to look back on fond times.
Sometimes all we have is our memories.
You're such a naughty person.  What did she do?
Oh no.  That didn't go well then.  Look for a ring next time.
What makes you feel lucky?
That's so sweet of you!
Im guessing you must have had a family memeber die?   Im so sorry for your loss.   
THat must be tough to deal with.  I cant imagine losing a parent!
Does a guest house mean you rent it out or you let family and friends stay for free?
Taht sounds lucrative! I have a place in Big sky MT. it worked out very wellas far as renting.
Why's that? Are you worried about driving?
Ah-ha! Do you know anyone in your family who's good at bargaining? Maybe the sales-person is a hard-bargainer.
Wow_comma_ I wonder if she knew that you two were together. Did she know that you saw her?
She totally knew! I guess it's flattering to know your partner is good looking enough to have a woman stare him down like that.
I have been there_comma_ done that.  I used to be a dog groomer and I love dogs.   Its so sad to go the pound and see all the homeless dogs.
I usually deal with it by not going to the pound anymore to look.   I had a dog die in a house fire not long ago and I am just not ready for a dog.
I'm such a scaredy cat when it comes to scary movies. What was the movie about?
Oh gosh. That's terrifying! I don't know anyone who likes those kind of movies!! 
wow. That is amazing_comma_ I love to change. What color did you choose? 
Nice. I would like to do the same_comma_ but it is very expensive where I live. I hope I can afford it one day.
Woo! Where are you headed?
Omg! Europe is my absolute favorite place in the world. I recently came back from Italy and Greece 2 months ago and loved it!
Well_comma_ I went to Venice_comma_ which I absolutely loved_comma_ but it was very crowded. I hear Florence is beautiful too! In Greece_comma_ I recommend Santorini_comma_ or Mykonos if you wanna party! 
Yay! It's BEAUTIFUL. If you go_comma_ you will love it. 
Oh wow where you in the area when it happened?
Thank Jesus! lol I am glad you are OK.
Same. It's hard to predict.
How did you accomplish this?
Where do you keep everything?
Do you have some sort of method of organizing everything?
How much stuff did you have to go through?
Well its always a good thing to keep a promise. Can I ask what the promise was?
Well I applaud your dedication and faithfulness in making sure you kept the promise_comma_ good job!
See things work out well when you make doing the right thing a priority. I am glad you followed through on it
Ah its ok_comma_ we all amke mistakes. Are you in a new town?
Good! I bet you got it down much faster after making a mistake.
Did you move in a better home? 
WOW that's so convienient.
Well_comma_ at least you dont have to worry about him begin ok in life. He can take care of himself_comma_ now. You can give him tips on making better choices with his money
I understand.My little brother did too.. I have the family and he has the career. We are 10 years apart_comma_ but he make a ton more money than_comma_ I do. Maybe you can get your brother to invest in homes_comma_ and you all start a business.
Right_comma_ you should! Remember they arent making any more land!
Wholesaling would be an great options. You could go on Youtube and find tons of videos about flipping homes with no money.. but if your brother has a little change.. Well.. Go Brother! lol
I will go out on a limb and say she didn't hold up her end_comma_ hope you get your garden back bright and beautiful
I understand the frustration a good garden takes time and patience_comma_ I have no doubt you will grow it back better than before
No problem I got faith in you_comma_ really enjoyed this chat
Awwww.. what a heart warming moment. That was so sweet of you to do! 
That's so cute! Turtles running around?! Haha!! I have a rabbit_comma_ he loves to hop around my house too!
Good luck.  That sounds really frustrating.  Hope everything was backed up.
Sounds like a good plan.  I hope it's simple and you can get it working again.
Do you have experience fixing computers?
I hear you.  Technology is supposed to make things simpler.  Not always the case.
Oh yeah? Nice to hear. What exactly did you do?
That's awesome_comma_ I'm from Kansas and first went to Colorado just a couple years ago. It was beautiful!
I agree though_comma_ always a good time to get away and explore some nature life.
Well I'm pleased to hear you had a fun time. Hope you get to do it again soon.
What happened next?
Wow it must have been good feeling
Oh man_comma_ I'm so sorry. How did it happen?
That is so sad. Did you see it happen?
ooh_comma_ sorry to hear that_comma_ was it by itself?
sorry. Probably the driver did not see her
wow. Am happy for you_comma_ just commit to it and it will thrive
all the best
did you tell them to stop speaking?
i bet .Next time call the people in charge
Oh_comma_ dear. did they pull you over?
Were you speeding? I would have been nervous too.
I see. Well_comma_ I hope all you got was a ticket.
oooh_comma_ thats so scary and bad of them
Thats worrying_comma_ she need help
My friend and I were out at the bars one night_comma_ doing the usual young people thing. They had been acting off a little all night_comma_ and when I asked if they were okay_comma_ they told me everything was fine. I knew this wasn't true since I had known this person for years_comma_ but the night came to a close and we got a cab home. 
I'm sorry you felt that way. Is it any better now?
Your friend must trust and care for you a lot to confide in you like that. how did you react?
That's good. you must have been surprised by the confession.
Wow! I hope he doesn't do anything too crazy!
I hope you have as much fun as he does!
Oh that's great. Were you able to help him move?
Well at least you were able to introduce him to your friend. I hope everything works out for him!
Sometimes going out with friends can relax the mind_comma_ who knows you might ace the test .
That stinks _comma_ cheer up and try again 
hello_comma_ why whats happened ?
you founded the preacher helpful ?
I never did go to a preacher.
What was the secret about?
I won't tell anyone! Come on_comma_ just one juicy detail??
I am really sorry to hear that.  How are you healing from it?
That's good.  I'm glad you had good doctors to help you get back on your feet (no pun intended).  Are you having o be out of work?
I mean did they reward your 25 years of service at your job by giving you a present or throwing you a party. It's pretty common for workers when they reach such a milestone to be recognized in such a way.
You should've made them buy another cake!
thats great_comma_ are you enjoying it?
thats awesome_comma_ im glad they were helpful!
Oh I'm so socially awkward and anxious I'd never be able to give a speech. How did it turn out?
I'm so happy to hear that! Practice does make perfect.
Oh I am so sorry to hear that. :( I hope that she will be alright. Is it serious?
Oh no! Well you better spend as much time with her as you can now. It could be any time she leaves. Oh what a heard situation you are going through! If you need a friend I am always here for you.
That's very lucky_comma_ how much was it for?
Yeah I can understand_comma_ it's definitely a pleasant surprise.
That's good to be able to depend on others.
That's so true_comma_ life is very fragile and I find it easy to forget that.
It's nice to be loyal to people who are loyal to you.  Is your job going to offer you any benefits for your loyalty?
Why did you choose to stay?
Food is the hardest part when it comes to getting healthy sometimes. Dont give up! 
Omg! Okay now I understand how difficult it really must be for you! 
Oh my that must have been frightening! Poor little cat_comma_ what happened afterwards?
I can just imagine_comma_ maybe she wanted a bath. Glad to know she wasn't harmed.
That sould make me feel sad. Did you talk to him about it?
That's not very nice. I think it is just better to be honest_comma_ even if it might hurt.
I certainly know that feeling.
You can always improve that anytime you want to.  I have faith in you.
Do you plan on paying him back quickly? 
I mean its pretty crappy to take anything from anyone_comma_ but hes your brother so it is slightly less crappy as long as you pay him back! 
Uh oh.  I'm sorry to hear that.  That is never a good thing to do as a supervisor.
Unfortunately he wins out when you do that because it will likely continue.  Again_comma_ I wish you had been treated so unkindly.
Something juicy I hope. 
Whoops! Did she take it with anything approaching a sense of humor?
Oh no! I am afraid to ask what it was.... but what was it?
Yuck! You better put a trap up there. You know they have these wireless web cams these days for really cheap so it may be a good idea to get one of those so you know for sure if you have an infestation.
Oh dear. Is it what I am thinking? Did she wreck it?
I am so sorry to hear about that. The good thing is she is okay
I would be upset as well
Wow_comma_ that's really great that they pitched in to help. You must be happy about that!
The more hands_comma_ the quicker the work!
Making moves to do better is all you can do.  How has it been going?
That is great!  The longer you do it the easier it will get.  Keep up the good work!
No problem!
What were you invited to speak about?
It's hard to condense a pep talk into nice little one liners. But I think if you just go for it_comma_ breathe deeply a bunch_comma_ and pretend it's just you in that room_comma_ I think you'll do great!
i hate to ask what happen_comma_ I imagine something went wrong
that is the problem with cheating_comma_ you have to live with it especially if you have a conscious_comma_ all I can say is to use this promotion as a lesson to better prepare yourself next time
Had she been bothering you recently?
I get that. I don't respond well when people are rude to me.
What a pain!  I think when a big company makes so much money and they say they'
Oops_comma_ sorry_comma_ I didn't finish my thought.  I think they make enough money to handle it and that inconvenience is worth $80.  Plus now you'll definitely buy again with them so I think it works in their favor and yours!
That's awesome. It's wonderful to feel prepared!
Now you just have to keep up that same energy all year_comma_ that's the difficult part.
Congradulations.   You must be excited and proud.   Are you enjoying the new car?
Oh no!  Hopefully you have full coverage? 
Yeah but_comma_ its better than having no car!
Does your insurance have the "new care replacement"  option?
That is great!  When is the wedding?
Are you having a bachelor party?
The best kind of bachelor party.  That is exactly what I did for mine...20 years ago.
You should make it an annual trip!  Then you can always be reminded of a good time in your life.
How much did she give you over
Most places will make her replace the 10 so you should really go back to there and explain what happened
That sounds like he startled you quite a bit_comma_ hope it wasn't a black cat.
Awww well other than the heart attack giving sounds like a cute cat
I am sorry to hear that. How did that make you feel?
I feel your pain. I hope you had someone to lean on.
I have not seen the message about the incident but I do hope that person will speak to you.
That was the right thing to do. You respect your marriage.
Awesome. I love my mate too. That coworker is very out of order! 
I'm sorry you had to go through all that stress. But yay for you being able to leave that situation!
That's great to hear. It sounds like it's a well needed change. Things will look up from here!
Do you trust your friend?
That's great.  Its good to have a friend you can trust that much.
Would it be a promotion?
I hope you make the right choice!
That is a pretty weird thing to have happen
Maybe you should contact the news about it
Sounds like somebody needs an accountabili-buddy...
Wow you should probably tell her so that lies and decent don't become commonplace in your marriage.
That is not ok to do.
Yeah people like that are jerks
He must have been very excited! That is awesome.
Ah. You must do it more often. Children are so precious.
Oh no! Did they take you to jail?
Yeah_comma_ I wouldn't feel to good about myself either but at least no one got hurt including yourself.
Oh my_comma_ it must have been an exciting time for you seeing your brother after such a long time
I can understand why it would be a little nerve wracking but I am glad you caught up with him
Sounds scary. Did you find out what it was?
Were there any recent events in your neighborhood that would make you worry?
you should go to their place
that is sad that they cant atleast talk to you
Oh no!  They are mean to not have told you.  I would've told you.  How did it even get there?
Oops!  Well_comma_ just hold your head high because things happen to all of us and it doesn't speak to who you are as a person so just let it roll off your chest.  Shame that people are decent enough to help.
Hey_comma_ I bet you'll do great! Nothing to stress about. 
Just try to stay positive and get a good night's rest the night before and I'm sure you'll do amazing! Just have to go in with confidence.
Wow_comma_ you must really be excited. Do you have room for it in your kitchen?
That sounds delicious! Can I come over?
Congratulations on the good raising of the kid! I bet you were just flooded with all kinds of memories.
Wow that is so sweet. Have you shown her it yet?
That just warms my heart_comma_ thank you for telling me that.
Hail can be freaky! Was there any damage?
We don't get them too often_comma_ here. Though there's usually a few tornadoes that touch down somewhere in the area_comma_ each year. 
I bet that was nice though.
Does your high school do reunions where you could see them again?
Wow_comma_ what happened next_comma_ is he alright?
Wow what type of dog is he? Is he a big one that acts tough or a little one that needs lots of love?
Wow_comma_ I actually love them! Did you take him to see a vet? You seem so concerned about him to even take time off work.
I am so glad to hear that. A healthy puppy makes everyone happy.
Nice!  What did you end up with?
I say if you can afford it enjoy it.  What is your favorite feature?
I haven't_comma_ but I would love to get one.  I love full feature phones!
Everything about getting something new like that is fun!
You must be very fond of such memories. Do they make you feel nostalgic?
Its always good to think about such moments_comma_ I wish I could go back to these times.
Wow_comma_ he did he do?
You must be so proud of him!
What am amazing feeling that must be!  Did it take you a long time?  Must have felt so satisfying.
Its paying off!  That's awesome. How much can you bench?
I agree! Is she excited?
Haha_comma_ Good for her! She is becomeing more independent! Do you know what kind of car?
Feeling sentimental much?
I know how you feel.  I've got old rifles from both of my grand fathers... along with some WW II bring backs.  I don't think I could sell them.
Sorry to hear that. I hope you're not feeling too sad. 
I had no idea snakes even lived that long. I am sure he was a faithful buddy to you.
Maybe its time to find a new job?
Awesome.  Are you feeling a little jealous?
Don't worry_comma_ I'm sure she'll put a dent in it before the month is up.
You should take a ride with her and try to get her to paralell park in a tight space or something
oh my goodness. Thats so cool. who did you show it to.
Wow_comma_ love looking through memorable s. brings back good memories.
Yeah_comma_ tell me about it. I have nothing from that far back from my family.
I will. I bet my aunt has some things to give me.
Yeah_comma_ I know what you mean. Coffee always cures my headache. But then again it is probably not having coffee that causes the headache too.
I wish I could say the same. I am addicted. :(
Why not? Is everything okay?
That must be somewhat frustrating at times.
Oh that is awful. The loss of a pet is just the worst
I hope it starts to not hurt so much. I always take forever to stop hurting from those things.
It is good to have people you can count on. If you can't trust your family_comma_ who can you trust? :)
Totally! I also have a very trusting family.
That's unfortunate. I hope you didn't get chewed out too badly.
I guess they don't see it as just copy paper. To them stealing is stealing no matter how petty. At least you have the chance to change your ways and keep your job.
Sorry to hear that_comma_ it must be absolutely devastating. But you must stay strong.
I am glad you have all the support you need. The important thing is your family is safe. 
What? Oh no! Can they do that?  I would fight it and see what happened.  You must feel sick.
I am so sorry.  That is awful. Definitely look into your rights as an accepted student who was counting on that and made all your plans around it.
Oh no! I take they still got their claws. mine is the same way but there is one piece of furniture he just insists on ruining.
oh my goodness. they got a taste of it and went to town. i'm so sorry.
Yep_comma_ thats what I did with the chair mine messed up pretty bad.
Yeah I've gone a few times actually. Do you like them?
That's awesome! I wish you all the luck_comma_ but I bet you won't even need it.
It's going to knock everyone dead! I'll be rooting for you
Oops! Do you think that you can replace it?
Oh know. I am sure your mother will forgive you. I was an accident and we all have accidents sometimes.
That was nice of you to do. What kind of dog does she have?
I love dogs! I am thinking of getting another one.
Oh my_comma_ do you have a draft saved. Or was that the only copy?
It must have been so aggravating. I hope the due date wasn't the next day! 
That's amazing!  Did you get i?
Waiting is the worst!  Well_comma_ whatever happens is meant to be.  I wish you luck and success with your house!
That's really great. You're setting a good example for your kids_comma_ too.
That's really great! Your kids will thank you for giving them that important lesson.
That is a good place to be.  Are you happy with your job?
I'm sure it will!
Yep more than that and you will need a big house and lots of toys! 
Aw I am sure you will be good parent to all of them. Kids are the greatest joy in life.
Really? That must be fun
That is so nice I wish I had a car like that.
Ugh do you have any security camera that might have captured what happened?
I hope so too. Its really annoying when that happens and just ruins your day. 
I hope you do very well! What subject?
I think you will do great!
Haha! That definitely must have scared many people that did not know what it was. That must be hilarious to watch!
hahaha I can imagine! I guess I would have done the same. I hope you got him back. Heehee
And you know when men get sick_comma_ they're on their death bed.
And you know when men get sick_comma_ they act like they are dying.
I'm sorry about that. What happened?
Wow_comma_ that stinks. Hopefully she will be there for you next time if you ever need help again. 
I am sorry to hear that.
It must be very difficult for you. Do you have someone you can talk to about it? I find that remembering the good times helps you keep their memory alive.
That's great. It's nice to have family around that can help pick you up when you feel down.
Awesome! What are your plans for this weekend.
That is wonderful. I will be spending time at home.
That is so sweet. Family is very important
That's awesome! What show?
That's an interesting experience!
Has she had a history of illness?
I'm sorry to hear that. 10 is still very young though so I hope you have plenty of more time to spend with her.
I have some of that too. It would make me a little nervous.
Ugh_comma_ well I hope the best for you_comma_ that it is all nice and intact when you get back.
Really? Why you should have been patient.
Oh dear. Maybe you were just a bit impatient but I am sure he will forgive you 
WOW! That is really cool! What will you buy?
Have fun spending it!
That must have been embarrassing_comma_ wasnt it?
Did you retaliate against your boss?
Was it a prestigious or expensive vase?
Looks like it was just an accident. It happens and you shouldn't blame yourself for it.
Great_comma_ since you are prepared I'm sure you will do great!
If you could speak with someone that work there you could learn more about what to expect and what things they value the most_comma_ but you certainly seem very prepared.
It's very scary! I live near the coast too! I don't know if my home will still be here in 50 years.
No_comma_ I'm not. I'm hopeful that the deniers will start to come to their senses and maybe we can slow the warming of the earth.
I am so glad to hear everything is going well for you!. It is good to hear your health is improving.
That is a long time to suffer. It seems like it is a new day for you.
Oh no! I'm so sorry!  Is she okay? That is so great that she has you.
I agree.  Be there no matter what.  I hope she heals quickly.  
That's good that you trusted him. Sometimes I miss out on good opportunities because it is hard to trust.
That's awesome. That's a good amount for a little effort which is always nice. 
your intuition seems to be trustful and the right way to go
must be great to have that feeling of accomplishment and independent.
haha... you little thief! (joking) That must have been some good pizza!
Ahhh_comma_ oh well. Don't beat yourself up. I am pretty sure that I have done something like that before too. I think it was with birthday cake. I love birthday cake!!!!!
Haha! No! It's not wrong! My son played travel baseball for 6 years and we spent 6 days a week at the ballfields!
It's a huge commitment for him and you! If you don't think you can do it_comma_ I wouldn't sign him up. There's no shame in that!
Wow! How did it go?
That must have made you feel pretty nostalgic!
That would really stress me out
That is just the worst feeling. Part of the reason I work from home
Oh they need to take care of that asap!
Well for your sake I hope it gets taken care of soon.
That awful!  Were you able to continue without it?  That must have really messed up your rhythm.
Did it start back up? Glad you were able to start over.
You are a good friend.
yes they deserve respect unless they do soemthing cruel.
Why did he move so far away?
That's very sad.  I'm sure he'll be back to visit.
i hope your mom can understand _comma_ it was an accident and everyone makes mistakes 
lol_comma_ well hope she doesnt notice
Was it a good feeling or a bad feeling?
I do too. Being a kid was so easy.
Also not having a ton of responsibilites!
Yeah I completely understand that.
Oh man_comma_ that's a long break. How did it go?
That's great! Did your co workers help?
Hahaha that's funny. my bad_comma_ I feel like i need to hit the gym again as well.
Yea it sucks to go but feels great once you leave.
What did you get up to in August usually?
I used to love bonfires back in my day those were the days.
Agreed_comma_ what was your favorite memory?
Whoa that's out of left field_comma_ how'd that happen.
Good for you! Are you going to tell your girlfriend about it?
You are an honest man as well. I salute you! A rare breed indeed.
Aww_comma_ so cute! I bet your having such a fun time with him/her!
Wow I didn't know you could litter train rabbits. It's always challenging house training a new pet. I hope he learns quick!
Oh no! How gross! That must have been so embarrassing! Were you able to clean yourself up?
I can imagine. I would have lost my appetite for sure. That is a crazy story! 
It's great that you only have one more year left! What are you getting a degree in?
I totally get that! I am still trying to pay off my student loans. 
I think it's just human nature. Even if it were wrong_comma_ there may be nothing you can do about it. But I think there are ways you can take your negative emotions and put a positive spin on them_comma_ in order to motivate you in a more healthy_comma_ conducive way.
I could see that... Yeah. Well_comma_ I hope you are able to re-invest that energy into your own passions. I think you could do a lot for yourself.
Ok_comma_ and do you want to share this problem?
I see_comma_ at least you are getting professional help with your problem.
Did you want a watch?
That stinks.  It's hard when a parent favors one child over another.
It's your right as an American citizen.
Have a beer for me too.
Is it your first ferrari?
LOL man that's... I don't even know what to say.
What did he say in response?
Did you tell your husband?
I can just imagine_comma_ it must have been exciting for you.
That is so nice_comma_ the good thing is you arrived safely.
I'm so sorry to hear that. Is there a reason why you couldn't?
To be fair_comma_ travelling is expensive and probably overrated to a certain extent. I hope you do find the time to take some time away from work so you can enjoy yourself though.
Oh no that is terrible! I hope you and your family evacuated safely.
Wow I'm glad you are safe though. Do you know what started it?
Oh no! Were you able to find him/her?
Thank God! It can be heart wrenching when your pet is in danger.
Oh wow_comma_ that's cool.  And surprising haha
Let's hope this politician is honorable in other ways as well!
I love sushi its delicious
my favorite is california roll
I'm sure she is a lovely woman.
I love my mom very much too!
That is exciting news! You must be so happy for her! Are you going out to celebrate?
Well cheers to her! That is a great accomplishment!
I hope you have a good time!
Just remember to be a gentleman.
Hm sounds like a healthy choice! Do you feel good about yourself now?
Good job! Healthy food is always a good option and is actually cheaper to make than fast food!
Good.  Money_comma_ while important_comma_ is certainly not everything.
Keep grindin' bro!
Wow! How did that work out for you?
I'm sorry to hear that. You have to be more careful.
I'm sure you will ace it! what kind of car are you taking the exam in.
Yeah_comma_ that sounds like an easy car to drive. I will send out some good vibes for you. good luck!
Nice_comma_ what will you be cooking?
Sounds like you have quite the job on your hands! Hopefully it tastes great and you have a great meal.
Five is a great number_comma_ but six is even better. It's my favorite number_comma_ don't know why either!
No worries! That's so awesome. Are you taking lessons from a musician in a class_comma_ one on one_comma_ or online?
I'm glad to hear she is doing well.
I hope you both stay healthy!
Oh no!  what a bother_comma_  were you able to clean it up?
You shouldn't that could happen to the best of us.   
Oh_comma_ that would be tough! Were they together for a long time?
That was really nice of you. Your friend is lucky to have you!
What happened? How come you didnt get it?
Do you have any major bills coming up?
I think you will need to tell him how you feel about this. Otherwise you may end up taking more care of the cat than him.
Yea it will be unfair for the cat too who may feel lonely and unloved. You should tell him to be more responsible before he can get a pet.
I'm not 100% sure what that means_comma_ but that sounds exciting_comma_ especially if you're excited about it. Congratulations! Hopefully that means you guys will just keep getting bigger and bigger. 
That sounds awesome. I hope everyone is prepared for the next step so that you guys can keep getting better.
Do you enjoy your alone time or do you wish you had people around?
You totally should call a friend. I usually enjoy my alone time also but it is nice to have company around.
hey that's awesome man I'm proud of you_comma_ was it hard?
that's really good keep doing a good job okay
How far along do you think you are?
Well_comma_ I want you to know that it WILL be okay. I was scared to death when I found out I was pregnant with my first one_comma_ and it was really hard_comma_ but everything worked out and he is over 18 now and moved out. Also_comma_ if you decide that you don't want to keep the baby there are lots of options available too.
That must have hurt_comma_ did you get injured?
Tragic_comma_ I'd be more annoyed at losing my food I think.
I don't blame you. I would be trying to avoid bills too.
It is always good to have a pleasant relationship with your parents.
im excited for you! where are you goin?
i hope you all have a wonderful time
What city are they moving to?
That is about as far away as you can move_comma_ I am sorry to hear that_comma_ hope everything works out!
Glad to hear that_comma_  I hope you continue to be faithful to her in the future.
I agree_comma_ is you are not happy in a relationship anymore you should first end it and only after be with someone else.
Did you buy it all by yourself?
Haha_comma_ so you told a fib. Ain't nothing wrong with that.
Did you fall a lot?
Well have fun on the triple black diamond!
I love haunted houses! Did you go alone?
That sounds like a great time! It's always good to do those things with friends.
Ugh you need to tell him to return those things and tidy up the house. 
He might just be bluffing. Unless someone broke into your house?
Was a neighborhood you frequented?
That must have been a nice moment.
How did that make you feel?
I understand that_comma_ I get that could make you emotional_comma_ I hope time slows for you!
I am sorry to hear of your grandmother's passing. My condolences to you and your family.
Death can be very hard on families.
Oh_comma_ I'm so sorry. Was it unexpected?
That's horrible.  Please accept my condolences for you and his family.  Take care of yourselves and let yourselves grieve.
Oh no! Those little ones seem to do stuff like that all the time.
Did you try this stuff called "GOOF OFF"? Give that a try or some vinegar.
Oh cool. I love looking through my old photos. makes me feel warm and fuzzy.
Me too. I love to ponder about the good ole days. Did you share the photos with your friends or parents?
Oh no_comma_ did it burn?
I hate when I do that_comma_ but it is better for it to be cooked to long_comma_ than not long enough....
That must of been fun_comma_ where did you meet?
That is amazing. I hope I can get the family together soon.
Oh no_comma_ that's terrible. Is there anyway to redo it?
You better prepare well for that final.
that sounds amazing_comma_ I hope they enjoy it a lot!
It sounds like it will_comma_ i hope you have  a great dinner!
That's wonderful!  Are you thinking of proposing?
That's a good thing to be financially prepared_comma_ trust me.  My husband and I spent most of the money we had on a honeymoon and then struggled for years doing things the wrong way. You're smart!
Wowza! That is a good spouse. Were you suprised?
Good i bet you deserved it. :)
That is not good. Did they give you back your money? 
I would be upset too_comma_ they need to do their work properly.
I am glad that you got it cleared up.
I hope so too_comma_ you should have reported it to a supervisor or manager.
Why? Are you not happy with the job or you want to make more money?
Well I guess you should probably find a new job before quitting your present job.
I have had that happen before and it is super annoying!
I do not blame you one bit!
i used to get chased by dogs too _comma_ back then when i was younger fences were not to common
lucky you _comma_ i was bit a few times but it was my fault i provoked the dogs 
That sounds fun!  The arcades were always kind of noisy for me though.
You should go in a play some!
Oh_comma_ that's so hard! How are you feeling about it? Itching to go back_comma_ or dreading it?
That's good! At least it's someone you can trust instead of a stranger at a daycare center. 
Ouch! What did they do for it?
That sounds so painful! I hope it gets better fast.
That can be nerve wracking.  Are you worried?
Ah.  I find a mock interview with a friend can help.
Good luck!
That is smart of you. How did it go?
I am sure you will be OK. The doctors can be very scary sometimes but most people get scared about things that aren't worth it.
that is so sad to hear_comma_ it must be tough for you
wow that is a long time_comma_ but remember you had great experience with her and will have fond memories for the rest of you life
Good job! Hopefully she deserves the faithful person you are!
I can't help but be a little jealous. haha
Its possible she is just trying to be helpful.
I can see how that would be really annoying. Just nod and say yeah. Thats what works for me.
Did he live up to the belief?
That's great!  I'm sure he appreciated that you trusted him.
How exciting for you. Kids truly are amazing. Now the fun really starts.
Now you will have to really be careful what you say around him. They tend to repeat everything they hear when you least suspect it.
That is great! Congrats!
I bet you are so happy you stuck with it.. definitely something to be proud of.
Aw_comma_ will you be able to keep her company?
That is very thoughtful of you. You are a good sister!
Aw_comma_ nice! That's kind of cool_comma_ actually. I hope you really encourage her to stick to it and do well. Sometimes there can be a lot of expectations that come with that stuff_comma_ so whatever you can do to not add pressure to it would be great.
Yeah_comma_ I think her parents or her peers_comma_ or even herself probably_comma_ may put  a lot of expectations on her. While you want to reassure and encourage her_comma_ it's good to not make her plan too far ahead in the future and put all that weight on her. It's what my parents did with me_comma_ and I resented them for it.
I not sure what do you mean_comma_ but can use my imagination_comma_  it sounds like something really embarrassing.
Yes what I thought_comma_  I guess your roommate must have been more embarrassed.
Dang_comma_ i can relate i moved away from my mom a long time ago and still get a little homesick.
At least now a ways you can face time or call her to at least stay in contact.
I feel like this is me. I'm clean_comma_ but I'm stuck with a dirty roommate who doesn't do dishes. And I also live in a place that is old and looks terrible to begin with. Sorry you have to deal with that_comma_ because I know I hate living in it!
Me either. I've always been a fairly clean person. Had to move out of my parents home for college_comma_ and both roommates I've had have been kind of messy. I don't know how people don't feel weird and uncomfortable making other people live in/clean up their mess.
Oh no! That can be very scary! Did you make it out ok?
Was it a stranger or someone you knew?
Haha wow_comma_ thats cool. 
Oh really_comma_ what was the play?
That is awesome_comma_ I remember Odell Beckham doing that a few years ago.
That's horrible. I'd talk to your best friend and tell him how you feel firstly.
If your best friend is truly a best friend of yours_comma_ they won't leave you over this. It isn't right to tell his girlfriend in my opinion_comma_ but it is good if you speak to him about the situation.
Whoop Whoop! Thanks for reminding me. I have to purchase youtube live for it.
Same here! Who is your team?
Nice! I asdly am a corn husker. it's been a rough couple of years.
That must have been so fun!
It sounds like you have a great family!
I guarantee that you will be fine! I graduated with a master's last year
Environmental Engineering - my second engineering degree
That's wonderful news. I have also battled depression and am feeling better now. That  is a real big deal.
Wow! congrats and keep it up. I know it helps me to stay really busy.
Thats nice to  hear. Its the best feeling when kids come back home to visit. 
Aw it must have felt so nostalgic going through old memories. Its nice to cherish them. 
Do you miss him?
Be sure to facetime or skype with him. That will help with the loneliness. 
Oh no_comma_ that's terrible.  Is he in legal trouble?
This is such a difficult thing for you to go through.  I hope he learns from this and changes his path.
How come?
I understand. But you must cherish every moment because soon our babies grow up and become great adults.
Oh_comma_ that is horrible. I am sorry that happened to you!
I don't blame you_comma_ I wouldn't want to mess with that either. 
Why is that_comma_ might I ask? Maybe I can help you reframe it better to look at it more positively.
Oh_comma_ I see. Yeah_comma_ it kind of stinks being around people who can afford things you would like. But maybe you can view it as you being more mindful and responsible with your money.
That's very lucky of you_comma_ what do you plan on doing now?
If you did have to move_comma_ might I suggest Boston as an alternative?
Don't be nervous. I am sure you did alright. It is normal to think that but most of the time it is all in the head.
Oh good_comma_ then there is nothing you should be worried about then. :) Go relax and distract your mind on something else. All will work out my friend.
I hope you feel better soon. Maybe you can take a trip out to visit her?
I bet she really misses you. How far away did you move?
Oh wow_comma_ that's really far! Well I hope you get to go soon and have a safe trip!
Yea that can be tough. What kind of dogs? Are they easy to train?
Yup. I did that with my new cat and it ended up working out OK.
Yup! I am sure you guys will get through it!
I can understand the anxiety_comma_ I'm sure you'll do fine though!
Sleep is so important before an exam_comma_ that's where all your facts and memories get better organized
Is it possible to re-arrange the date to when the weather would be more favorable?
I see. You shouldn't let it spoil your plans. Go and have fun but take a rain coat with you!
Oh nice!! What kind of treats are you using?
Oh_comma_ I see. I give my dogs popcorn and they love it!
That's awful_comma_ how did your cat die?
I understand_comma_ I have 4 cats myself. The oldest is 14.
That's good! Do you usually like math?
haha good job man. Keep up the good work!
I am sorry to hear that_comma_ it is pretty embarassing to be in situations like that
Haha I hear you there_comma_ that stuff is potent
It's good to hear someone doing well for once. Most people are usually only up for complaining and seeing the negatives in things. I don't want to be too nosey_comma_ but can you tell me why you're feeling good about things lately?
Man.. I wish I could join you in the no debt part. That sounds like it took a lot of work. You're reaping the rewards. I hope things continue to stay stable for you_comma_ and you can keep it going until setting up a good retirement.
Wow I bet you were terrified! Did you see again after or just that once.
I bet_comma_ I wouldn't be able to sleep after either.
Sorry to hear that. What is he barking at?
Maybe turn on the TV and find a show about dogs. He might be too distracted to bark.
Haha that's not a problem! You must be a good cook!
Hahaha that's funny. Sorry but i find that hilarious.
That is a shame! I'm sorry to hear that. If you really like you job then just keep working hard. I am sure they will recognize your efforts pretty soon.
Go get them my friend!! I know you can do it!
That's great. Are you a nurse?
That sounds like a really cool profession
Is there any chance for something to happen? Seems like you developed a connection from afar_comma_ if he's still on your mind. Why do you think there's no chance?
Oh.. well that complicates things. Yeah_comma_ maybe that will make you seriously examine things. I think you're okay as long as you don't do anything while still in a relationship. But if you feel your current one is lacking something_comma_ and your eye is wandering_comma_ you owe it to yourself and your current boyfriend to reflect on why that is_comma_ and if there can be improvements_comma_ or if you should both move on.
I'm sorry. It can be hard to be in a situation where you think the other person is cheating. Is there any other reason she might be acting suspicious? Have you talked to her about it?
Maybe you just need to give her some space. Women tend to pull back when they feel like they are being smothered. Either it works or she moves on. No matter which happens you know.
Oh yeah_comma_ that is pretty embarrassing! But just imagine if you watched that happen to someone else. You would probably be laughing too. Lol
It would be pretty embarrassing too if it happened as an adult..... and I guess pretty funny watching it too.
I agree! I'm in a long distance relationship_comma_ but we've developed so much trust over the 7 years we've been together that I never worry about what she's doing or who she's with_comma_ and neither does she worry about me. We've slowly built up our communication over the years. I'm glad to hear that you have the same thing in yours.
You guys sound a lot like us. Glad to see that long distance can work for a change. It takes strong_comma_ honest_comma_ communicative people. It gets a bad reputation sometimes_comma_ when it shouldn't. I hope we end up like you guys and can end the long distance thing soon_comma_ though. Gets a little stale.
try not to stress out about it all weekend. if you didn't do anything wrong nothing bad will happen.
maybe the suspect something and want to talk to you about it. or maybe it's nothing. try not to let it drive you crazy. i know it's easier said than done.
Brothers always seem to want to get into fights with one another_comma_ but at the end of the day_comma_ I'm sure you guys love each other very much!
Why wouldn't you pass it to'em? Is he a bad shot and you don't want to tell'em?
What made you give them all away?
That is very kind of you_comma_ how old is your daughter now?
They are looking pretty good this year.
I hope the braves make it all the way!
thats great! how come?
sounds like you do have a great life!
That's unfortunate. At least you can use the experience with your current internship to get you to another place you want to go!
That's a great attitude. You will be fine_comma_ and can use this as a learning experience
thats awesome! where has he been?
thank you for his sacrifice and service! it is greatly appreciated!
Nice! And what country might that be?
Yes_comma_ things are looking quite good and will only get better from here.
That's cool! That is a long time! Was he the same as he used to be?
Yeah_comma_ remembering old times with a good friends is always fun!
That's a lofty goal_comma_ but if you work hard maybe you can achieve it.
Wow you must come from a very rich family_comma_ that must be nice.
Did you go buy a thousand dollar rig and show em who's boss?
You could have reminisced with an airsoft sniper from a safe distance.
What kind of letter?
I can understand the feeling_comma_ I think you'll get in though!
You must have been devestated!
Did you call the police or just let it go?
Uh oh.  I've heard that plenty of times only to see very similar results.  Time for the cat to move out I think.
Maybe you can keep the cat and have him move out.
You sound like a good friend_comma_ going through the effort and trouble to fix that up. I'm not into surprises_comma_ but I'm sure you know your friend well enough to know that he'd like it if you gave him one.
It's going to be really easy to see that he is special to you guys after tonight. I wish I had a friend like you_comma_ even though I don't like surprises. You should be proud of yourself. I hope it goes smoothly!
i'm the same way with my wife_comma_ i trust her.
thats a good feeling_comma_ i wish yall the best 
I hear you. You always have to have faith in your team.
I sure am. Im a New Orleans Saints fan. Im hoping for a good year also.
You must be feeling excited!
Wow. That is a long time to be waiting for a movie.
Oh that is so sweet. 
Flowers are definitely beautiful.
kids can be so hurtful_comma_ be happy about who you are!
i'm sorry about that! hopefully that kid has learned better by now
Who are the braves?
Ah great. Good luck. Are they good?
It can be pretty scary getting ready for a new environment. but i am sure after the first day it will be gone.
I'm sure you will! I bet you will do great things after school!
Oh no_comma_ What happened?
That is so scary_comma_ I am glad that you are okay! People are so crazy!!!
I love going back to my hometown. Its a good feeling being back. What are you most excited about?
I have never been. I would love to though. I hope you have a great time back at home.
Wow! Why would you cancel? Is it a good opportunity?
Well that's your choice_comma_ but I say new adventures in life are profitable!
I understand. They are so cute when they are toddler. How old he is now?
Great :)
that is scary! what is the problem?
oh im sorry to hear that! i hope it all works out for the best!
That sucks. I have had that happen. It did not feel good.
Sounds like you deserved that promotion.
That is awesome! Groceries can be expensive_comma_ so that was a blessing.
That is very helpful! I am glad you were able to get that discount.
Oh wow! Congratulations to your aunt! What did she major in?
She must be very intelligent! I hear that is one of the hardest degrees to get. Incredible!
What kind of surgery is she having?
Sounds painful_comma_ hopefully she recovers well
I love vacation! Where are you going?
That sounds so lovely
haha that's pretty cool. Is he a gymnasist?
Me neither! That is pretty cool. I fun party trick haha
that is cool_comma_ you must be really anticipating this visit
i bet both of you will have a blast together_comma_ don't have too much fun ;)
That's so sweet! I love my family too! What are some things you like to do together?
That sounds like fun! We like to play baseball and go to the beach! Family time is great!
That is great. I hope you get it. What is the job title?
Good luck
Oh no!  That's a terrible feeling.  Did you go home?
I bet the next morning was rough!
thats great! congrats on retirement!
what did you do?
That is good news! My life is also going great!
Im happy for you!
That is wonderful to hear. 
Not anymore_comma_ but it is so great to hear that it is possible to find happiness!
what color was it?
i bet it was nice! i like them too
i do too! they are very talented!
that is what makes them so special!
was it a gunshot?
that is scary! i live by a gun range and hear them all the time
I agree_comma_ are you looking forward to them winning some silverware?
Yep_comma_ and I think they will be playing fantastically well. No one stands a chance!
Sorry to hear that. It must be sad for you but remember he will always be with you in  your heart
Once you're ready_comma_ adopt a dog from the shelter in his honor. 
I am so jealous! So i am guessing it was worth the price?
When did you get it?
That is wonderful. i do hope that you will win
Unfortunately I don't but I have a brother who loves to play it.
oh no thats embarrassing. did anyone see?
i'm sorry to hear that! are you ok?
I hope it goes well! Are there any prizes for creating the best draft?
That's a lot of money. Best of luck to you!
Ahh.. I'm jealous. That sounds relaxing! What do you normally do that keeps you so busy?
I'm glad you have time to relax.. This week was my first week of school so I'm relaxing too now that its Friday!
I'm a sophomore in college trying to get into a good Nursing program!
That's so cool! I'd like to work in a hospital some day. But for now.. we can finally relax because it's the weekend!! 
That's great!  Congrats.  Which class?
Or you really know it!  I was never great at science_comma_ sad to say!
I loved history but couldn't really get a great job with that!  Exact opposite of what you are doing.
figures_comma_ right?  
is something wrong?
thats awesome! i hope that feeling continues!
You must feel prepared now since you've done all your planning and analysis. 
its a big ambition but you can do it with the right effort and commitment!
It would certainly make me furious if I witnessed that. Have you witnessed such an act recently?
The news can be so dark and depressing at times.
I bet you'll do fine. You are probably just nervous.
It is alright. being paranoid has its benefits. it will make you study more.
Glad to hear it. You are lucky to have such an amazing family.
That is the best thing to have in life. Not much else matters in my opinion.
That
I'm sorry! I meant to say that was so sweet of you. It's good that he has a good friend like you. 
That is cute. How old are they?
Are they males or females?
Oh that sucks! How are you feeling about that?
Understandably so. But hey_comma_ we all make mistakes and failing one class isn't the end of the world. In fact I failed Calculus 3 this semester. So take pride in what you have accomplished and just work hard next semester!
What movie was it?
I haven't_comma_ but I will check it out!
Finally_comma_ someone that sees it! Everyone around me disagrees but I have hope. 
It is great_comma_ I'm excited to see what the future has to offer.
I'd be furious if I witnessed such a thing too. Have you witnessed such an act like that lately?
I wonder how a person can do that to a child.
Haha. Sorry to laugh but you said it in a funny way. Are you ok?
Dang_comma_ i have doen the same. it can be pretty embarrasing.
Oh_comma_ I am sorry!  Did it turn out OK?
Aww_comma_ that's too bad.  I hope you don't have to fly a lot.
Yeah_comma_ driving is sometimes not an option.  How long is that flight?  I hope short!
Ugh_comma_ that's not great though.  But_comma_ yes_comma_ it could be a lot worse like across the country long.
What would you have done with the money?
Good for you_comma_ you have your priorities straight!
Holy cow_comma_ that is a bad to the bone car!
It is still a bugatti!!!
Surprise cake is the best.  What flavor was it?
Very nice_comma_ you should hold onto that girl.  Did you ask her to marry you on the spot?
Wait what does that mean what i think it means?
im sorry to hear that
Aw_comma_ that is so nice of you_comma_ I bet they really appreciated it.
Not a whole lot you can do besides make their day a little better which you have already done. They're in there to heal or get better hopefully. 
Oh_comma_ I'm so sorry. I hope she'll be okay.
I'm sure her doctors will do a good job.
How did you do when you took them?
Congrats! What college did you choose?
I hear you. Sometimes the realities and brutal nature of the world is hard to learn and know about. Almost makes you want to be ignorant to it all. Did you recently encounter this?
Yeah_comma_ it's also kind of disgusting how much the news plays those stories up_comma_ because they know it garners views. The kind of "if it bleeds_comma_ it leads" idea. But I guess we're the people that eat it up and make them do that.
I feel for you! Bad roommates are the worst
You are right being that age he will probably never change
It's always an intimidating atmosphere! Have you tried joining any clubs?
Right! Well I'd say try to get to know a few people really well that have common interests!
Sorry to hear that. Remember he will always be with you in your heart. 
Yes I have a pet Labrador back home. I miss spoiling him with treats so much. 
that sounds quite cool_comma_ did you not get the house
wow what a steal
Were you sent to detenton?
Don't feel bad.  Everybody does it bro! If you ain't cheatin_comma_ you ain't tryin!
That is horrible! Did you get into trouble?
I'm sorry that happened! At least you didn't get fired
Wow that is terrifying. Do the police know about this? They oughta increase security. 
I agree. These people deserve to be punished for preying on innocent civilians. 
Thats great! For school or work?
That is a tough field to work in_comma_ alot of people rely on you
Did he say anything?
I understand. He will most probably forget about it.
Okay so you need a can of hairspray
Well the alcohol in it will paralyze it enough for you to be able to kill it!!
They sound like some great_comma_ trustworthy samaritans. I am glad people like that restore my faith in humanity. 
Yep_comma_ I just feel it was a simpler time back then. Nowadays many of us just live in fear of one another. 
Was it reputable?  Did you do it?  How did it work out for you?
I'm sure that was a wise thing to do.  You saved yourself a world of pain!  Wouldn't it be nice if those things worked out?
thats awesome_comma_ good luck with that
well hopefully it is
Is he trustworthy>
That is good! What kind of car?
Yeah_comma_ I'm not a fan of those types either_comma_ but I try to hang around positive people!
I agree_comma_ I try not to think about that_comma_ hopefully they will learn to treat others better.
Really?! What is going on? Tell me :)
So happy for you! That is a very noble job. I think more women should be more interested in staying home with the children. I think the children would benefit so much.
Was this one scary?
That is terrifying! i don't do haunted houses lol
Are you a really big baseball fan? I have friends who have season tickets and love it.
That is really great. I enjoy a baseball game now and then.
Oh my goodness! You must have been very hungry. I hope you don't feel guilty. 
Don't tell her right after she awakes up. Women are never in the best mood right after waking up.
Oh no! Was the date still good?
Lol at least Dominos is good!
It happens_comma_ was it loud?
Aw_comma_ that's bad_comma_ you should try to play it off next time!
Ah ok. Are you trying to lose weight?
I have the same problem. You need to try harder.
And did he?
That is nice. Its always good to know that you have people you can count on.
yea its hard to see them leave
oh out of state_comma_ can be pricey but great for new experiences
I am sorry to hear about your loss. Was he a good man?
Oh yea i am sure he is too. Are you passing down the train set to anyone?
That's awesome_comma_ go him! I bet you and your family are excited.
I bet_comma_ cancer is the worst_comma_ and it's always amazing when someone over comes it!
That is good! Hopefully it stays that way for you.
That is always a great feeling. I am glad that your luck has changed
O really i though the Rangers were on top
Yeah since I live in Texas
I wouldn't stress so much if I were you. Everyone has to try something new for the first time and not everyone gets stuff right away.
I get anxiety too. I can be really hard to deal with it sometimes. I just have to "fake it until you make it_comma_" and power through ti until I gain confidence.
im sorry_comma_ theres nothing worse than that. i hope you're doing okay
im sorry. it eventually gets better though
thats nice to hear_comma_ too many relationships ending nowadays
wow thats awesome good for you
oh no!  I'm so sad to hear that :(
Yeah that's all you can do I guess.  Do you do anything cool in his memory?
Oh no did he/she get better? Did you have to take them to the vet?
Oh dang_comma_ there were multiple cats that were sick?
same_comma_ cats are so awesome
haha mine loves to just lay on me and get pets_comma_ hes so soft and cute
hes a rag doll with blue eyes and a white coat that ends in gray on his face tail and paws_comma_ what about yours?
thats nice thank you for telling me about your cat
You must be so excited! What game did you get?
That actually got great reviews. I am sure you are going to love it!
That's unfortunate. Did you have the flu?
Your next adventure will go much smoother. I once got a really bad rash in Hawaii when I visited.
That's awesome_comma_ where did you go?
I love california_comma_ I have some family in Sacramento! And I bet it feels great to be home after a long drive.
Oh my Gosh. I am sorry. that can be really tough.
Thats the most important thing. I bet he wants you to move on and be happy.
Haha that's really cool! What kind of watch is it?
Oh nice. Yea he would be happy to know you are wearing it now.\
Oh no. Did the workers have to come clean it up?
I bet you were a little embarrassed. I wouldnt worry too much about it. Im sure it happens everyday. 
That is so nice!  Did you get lots of presents?
So fun.  Did you have your baby? Congratulations on your pregnancy!
Ahh sounds like some great memories. Do you often feel nostalgic about these times?
Thats a great idea. That way your kids will get to experience such lovely moments as well.
Wow_comma_ lucky you.  I hope you are enjoying your time there.  They will be appreciative of the gifts.
How much longer are you staying for?
To have some rest after working so hard_comma_ it is very important.
It is a perfect leisure activity.
That sucks! It happens to the best of us. At least the computer didn't break.
Yeah_comma_ that would have been an expensive accident! Your lucky. :)
Holy cow that's awesome!  Who is it?
Hmm.  Never heard of them.  I'll look them up and give them a listen!  Hope you have fun!!!
Ha.  I actually live in KY. 
Yup.  We have a bluegrass event on the square once a year in the town that I live in
That is Good! How long have you been together?
Thats good! Sadly thats tough to find these days.
That is great.  Its good to not take family and friends for granted. 
Keep that attitude and you will go far!  
Those are the best times_comma_I can't wait until my son plays.
He is 2!
Aww thats a great time in life.
Is he your first?
That is cool! What kind of car?
Those are nice cars! I hope you are able to get one!
Oh no_comma_ what's wrong with your current car?
That sounds terrible. I'm sorry I can't diagnose a car over the internet though. My first guess for that is usually the battery. Then things like the cables or the starter or fuses.
That is awesome. What type of dog do you have?
My mother-in-law has one_comma_ too.
what are you going to do for his birthday
i love birthday gathers
What career do you work in?
You deserve a large raise_comma_ health care is hard work!
Oh_comma_ no.  I'm sorry.  Was it due to a test?
Math is not my favorite.  Can you ask the teacher/professor?
That is terrible_comma_ i am sorry! hopefully youll be able to get it taken care of this time.
What type of degree are you getting?
Yea those shows are hard to watch. 
Yea I agree. People can commit some really horrific crimes. It is scary.
Was the date not going well?
I hate when that happens. Was she understanding?
That's great_comma_ I wish I had been that productive today. Maybe I still have time for a load of laundry. Good job_comma_ you. 
I just haven't been feeling too great today. Maybe your right though an easy task might make me feel better and get a head start for tomorrow. 
Is he okay?
ewwwww that's gross lol
Where?  Why are you feeling uncertain?
I can understand the nerves_comma_ but it will be fun!
What happened/
Well_comma_ I hope you did the right thing and correct their mistake.
Oh_comma_ that's the biggest pain.  I feel like when you pay good money for care for your pet...they should at least be on time.
We move our lives and schedules around to take care of our pets...the least the can do is do their work well.
I sure hope that you get it!
I believe you will get it!
that's right_comma_ it is supposed to come out  soon_comma_ I bet you will enjoy it very much
sound like it must be killing you on waiting for the release_comma_ before you know it. you'll be playing it a ton
That is awesome. I bet you feel great!
And its only going to get better. The longer you go the more progress you will see. Good for you.
Good job. Is she better now?
That stinks. I hope she feels better soon!
Wow_comma_ what did you see?
Ugh_comma_ I hope he's alright and it was nothing too bab.
Did he do a good job?
Thank god_comma_ bet you're pleased about that aren't you?
Oh my_comma_ are you physically okay? It must have been very traumatic for you.
Money can always come back but your health is the most important thing.
Oh no_comma_ that's no good. Did she find out?
Just have a talk with her and apologize. I'm sure she'll understand. Addiction is a life long battle. It's never too late to jump back on the wagon.
Uh oh!   You should go see a doctor to get that checked out!
Yeah that's what I would do!  Good luck_comma_ friend!
What did you do?!
Lousy man! What can you do though...if you're a regular she'll understand when you bring her extra another time.
sounds sweet_comma_ you must be raring to go
lol_comma_ the kid in you is always ready for Disneyland
I agree.  Has something bad happened to you recently?
Yeah it really can bring you down
Oh man thats scary! What set it off?
I can imagine_comma_ i wouldnt have been at ease either.
Good luck! I bet you'll get it_comma_ I have a feeling.
No problem! Is it a career oriented job?
That is exciting_comma_ what is the test for?
Oh ok cool_comma_ are you already a police officer?
Wow_comma_ thats horrible! Make sure to get a police report and send it to your insurance. 
I'm sorry_comma_ try to relax and have a good weekend. Know how fustrating that can be_comma_ hope there wasn't much damage.
Awesome I am happy to hear that!
Nice_comma_ make sure to soak it up.
I never know what to do in that situation.
I bet. you never know if they are the crazy type or just down on their luck.
oh just wait.. that's nothing. How long were you gone for?
It rotted in 8 days? I'm pretty embarrassed. 
Oh no!  I've had that happen before. Not at Walmart but at a dentist office. Did you make a dash out of there?
Yeah_comma_ I had to tell them some might be on the chair.  It was crazy awful! Oh no_comma_ ha ha. sorry that happened.
Are you going to miss him?
I like to watch movies or read a good book when I feel lonely_comma_ to keep my mind busy 
Uh oh. What went wrong?
That's too bad. Did they taste okay though?
Aw_comma_ that stinks. What was wrong? Were you sick?
Wow! That's insane! I'm sorry that you had that experience! Hopefully you didn't miss too many days of work. 
Heck yeah!  I love old tv shows!  What was it?
Yeah.  It's kind of old now.  Was a really good show for its time until the RANDY DAYS
Me too. Moms are the bees knees.
My mom did too. Your mom sounds incredible.
Congrats! I'm sure you will_comma_ I love going to the gym. I mainly do cardio.
Defenitly! I use to run track in high school and was active duty Army so running has always been a big part of my life.
Awesome! I need to have a garage sale.
I can understand that! I don't like clutter.
Wow! That's amazing. I remember when mine started. It's off to the races soon! 
Two words of advice... baby gates :)
Aw man. I'm sorry. How old did he turn?
It'll be ok. As long as both of you guys are healthy.
I sure hope so_comma_ do you think he is a determined and intelligent person?
Nice_comma_ you must be proud of him being your brother.
That was very nice of you. I am sure that your sister appreciated that.
That is great.
Nice_comma_ do you get to go the zoo any number of times you want for free?
Sounds like a dream for any animal lover! I am guessing you must be one as well!
Ewww_comma_ I hope you complained so they can fix the problem! That is defenitly a health violation.
Oh okay! Hopefully it isn't a constant problem_comma_ that would suck to loose your favourite resturant.
i know how you feel_comma_ being young and at the beach was a fun time
you can make new memories and your kids can fondly look back at them as you do to yours
Aww that's really sweet. I understand being sentimental about that sort of stuff. Do you feel like you have to?
You should just keep it for now. He may think that stuff is corny now_comma_ but later in life he will be glad you kept it.
Haha how dare you. lol just kidding. What kind?
Ooooo i understand why you did.
Oh that's awful! Will insurance cover it?
That's terrible. I hope you can get some compensation and feel better.
Yeah_comma_ not in awhile_comma_ but I definitely know that feeling.  Are you having a great week?
That's awesome_comma_ I hope it stays that way!
Hey that's awesome!  Where ya going?
Yeah I haven't either.  I bet it's gonna be awesome.  Bring plenty of beer :D
Filled up? You better clean it before it overflows!
Ew_comma_ yeah_comma_ definitely sounds like it needs a good cleansing!
Wowza_comma_ did you call to complain?
Phone companies are notorious for this. I hope you are able to resolve.
I have had that happen to me many times.
It is definitely  a lot of work_comma_ but it is the best type of work I have ever done.
That was nice of him. What idea did you have? As in how to return the favor or something?
Ohh... hah_comma_ that makes more sense. Then he did his job well. Good on him. But more importantly_comma_ congratulations to you for graduating! I know the feeling.. I'm close to graduating myself_comma_ and I can already feel the excitement. I hope no one surprises me with a party though.. too shy of a nerd for that.
That's kind of disgusting. I'm glad she's your ex. That says much more about you than her. How did you respond to it?
Oh_comma_ that happened WHILE you were still dating? Man.. good call. The nerve of some people_comma_ and how immature they can be. I don't get how that wouldn't make someone cringe.
They probably have to interview everyone else but it sounds promising!
I bet it is! and I am sure you ARE good enough. Plus the way I see it if one door shuts another opens you know? Keep your head up 
Aw it must so hard to let them move on to their own. 
I completely understand. My little baby just went off to college and although I miss him terribly_comma_ I am also proud of him.
That sounds amazing!  Mom's food is ALWAYS the best.
Wow!  That sounds like an amazing visit.  
Oh no_comma_ what did you do?
how did they find out?
haha. has she found out yet? i bet she was mad
i would be too!
That sounds like a nightmare! Hopefully no one was hurt.
Did they take a lot of things?
That will be fun. I went for my 18th birthday and it was exciting.
Get the video_comma_ It is worth it!
I completely agree. It used to be about the story line and the character development. 
I hope so_comma_ too. Meanwhile_comma_ you can just watch old movies.
Ah_comma_ couldn't resist? Just make up and eat well tomorrow!
Yeah_comma_ you should hide them at least!
That's cool. What are you gonna eat there?
Oh sweet is it one of those where they cook it in front of you?
That is nice_comma_ what happened?
That is awesome_comma_ hopefully yall can continue your relationship
It must have been nerve wracking! Did you do well?
Ha! When in doubt_comma_ just blame it on the microphone!
Oh gosh! That must have been embarrassing. What happened?
Thank goodness for them! Did you not study your lines enough? Or you were just too nervous?
Haha too funny! Wow 14?! Suprised you didn't learn it earlier haha 
I bet_comma_ thats a great memory! lol
i agree with you there_comma_ I do not trust those eastern bloc countries.
you made a wise choice_comma_ not only will you not get your t-shirt most likely they will steal your credit card information and use it
My husband does that all the time to! Must be a guy thing haha
Wow_comma_ I hope he cleaned it up for you. I would be pissed hah I take coffee very serious.
That's a loaded statement.. Can you unpack that for me? What are you so excited about that's coming up?
Oh_comma_ right on. Do you guys not have school starting already though? Maybe you guys have kids that aren't school-aged. Anyway_comma_ I've only been a couple of times_comma_ to go to Disney World. Is that where you guys are going? If so_comma_ I hope you have a good time!
hahahaha that's so funny.  Did you get it out of the house?
Dang that's creative!!
Rainy days are perfect for being lazy.
That sounds relaxing.
Oh my_comma_ it must have been scary for you being in an unknown area_comma_
What a good Samaritan! Be careful next time and carry a phone with you just in case. 
What car is it?
Those are nice cars_comma_ but keep working_comma_ it will come in due time
I agree_comma_ looks like a great game to play with friends! When is it coming out?
That is actually not far! I can see what I am going to be doing over the holidays! 
That's awesome_comma_ thats a kind of woman every man needs in their life.
I'm happy for you_comma_ I'm sure she feels the same about you!
What new job did you get?
That is great news_comma_ hopefully it goes well.
Oh yeah_comma_ what makes you say that?
What an incredible stroke of luck! I hope he lets you check it out_comma_ really get your hands on it!
What'd they say exactly?
What kind of hairstyle was it?
That must make you feel good. Any favorites? 
Ah yes that is a good one. Where you close with them?
i have never gone. was it really that much fun going with an ex though?
maybe i will check it out. i have heard good things about Branson
Why is that?
That is good then_comma_ I hope they can fix it for you!!
That is really sweet. It sounds like you really love her.
It seems like you know what to do to make it work.
Oh no_comma_ I'm sorry that sounds awful disappointing. If it's any consolation I think it's easier to diet than to work out. THe old phrase "can't outrun the fork."
I'm sorry. What has really helped my friend has been not keeping any snacks in the house and cutting out most bread. HE really struggles with bread and sugar though.
that sounds cool_comma_ they are a great vehicle
you shouldn't be_comma_ it just a material object that has no lasting meaning
oh im so sorry! it hurts when our parents leave us.  my uncle_comma_ who was basically my father_comma_ died in april.
it's ok to feel however you are feeling. it's normal. you never get over it_comma_ but you do learn to live with it.
That's awful. Are you going to complain to the restaurant?
What kind of toppings did you order?
Why does baseball remind you of him?
Those must be great memories.
That must of been no fun.
Prepare to spend hours on it_comma_ the directions are always bad.
Yum! I had pizza as well tonight_comma_ although I didn't make it.
Yes I did_comma_ I need to learn how to cook one by myself!
Ugh_comma_ do you know how it got there?
Oh my goodness! Do you think an intruder got in and used your house as a washroom for his dog?
I'm sure you will do fine! Just be confident_comma_ what is the job/
Oh wow that sounds exciting! I'm sure you'll do great_comma_ just express that passion!
Haha i am sorry to laugh. Is it an expensive window to fix.
Damn_comma_ I am sorry that happenened.. did you talk to the paper boy?
Sorry to hear that. Have you tried encouraging them to play together?
Oh no_comma_ is he territorial? He will warm up eventually when he realizes the cat is a family member.
Oh I am so sorry. It's OK_comma_ it probably wasn't the cheetos that got him - rodents just don't have a long lifespan. I hope you feel better.
Rest in Power bubbles. You were_comma_ I'm sure_comma_ a hamster among hamsters.
Do you think you can impress them?
I believe in you_comma_ just project yourself confidently!
It definitely can be_comma_ just learn to drive defensively!
You will learn with experience and I'm sure you will be a great driver!
Are you prepared? Do you have all the ingredients?
Nice. I am sure it will taste great then.
Did it bring back good memories?
Sometimes it's fun to look back.
I can understand your frustration.
I am sure you can find a friend to help out.
did you call your card company?
i dont blame you. that is a very annoying thing to have to deal with
Do little kids dressed as witches and ghosts frighten you?
That's understandable. I've always been too scared to go to a haunted house. I get spooked easily.
That is a very nice thing for him to do. Where did he pick you up?
Wow were you ok? Lucky you didn't have to go to the hospital!
Why did you give him access to your home though?
That makes sense_comma_ you guys going to hangout soon?
im terrified of rollercoasters
i agree_comma_ i just get on and close my eyes
Oh my_comma_ I hope you weren't embarrassed about it_comma_ if it was a good trip?
Nice! I would love to go on trips except that my boss wouldn't like it if I did! 
Did it help you rewind the old times? 
I agree_comma_ thats why I always keep my old year books around when I feel like I need a break from the present.
Oh no! That's exciting and terrifying. Do you think it will work out?
In that case I'd say you very well deserve it! I hope you get it.
How so?
Ah yea now everyone is stuck staring at there phones.
Yeah_comma_ flying is the worst.
You can also have some drinks too!
Oh you left some out then? Were they worse ones?
Ah I am also guilty of that one. I believe we all are in some ways.
How come_comma_ what are you doing wrong at work?
I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ you must be so let down.
That ig good to hear! How long have you been together?
Aww that's a significant amount of time.
Oh no_comma_ what happened?
I hope your dog makes a full recovery!
How exciting! Do you feel like you are ready?
It is great to be confident. I am sure you will knock the interview out of the park!
Hey that's awesome!  Any plans this weekend?
Yeah that's good that you're keeping a level head about it.  And realize that anything can happen at a moments notice.  I tend to appreciate what I have in my life as well.
Oh no that sounds terrible. Hopefully it's not as bad as some of those stories I have read about where they go so far that they fake having the degree.
Oh my gosh that sounds so awful. I'm sorry. Maybe you can try getting him into rehab_comma_ I hear it's hard for someone to stop once they start.
Your mom must be a strong woman.
That sounds so troubling.  You should get on your brother's case.
What a bummer. Did you have any sort of coverage for it? And how did you do it accidentally?
Hopefully you can get through the rough patch in the interim. 
Yeah well you only have so much time to work with. Time management is one of the most important skills you can learn.
The most important thing is to realize you need improvement. Some people like to blame everything else but themself!
Maybe you unconsciously wanted to wear it. Maybe you have some hidden desires your subconscious wanted to explore for you? What if you went and did it again the next day_comma_ to see if you liked it?
It's time to go online and buy some summer dresses for yourself. Explore your femininity_comma_ man. It's 2018. Anything goes. Bruce/Caitlyn Jenner_comma_ etc. Summer isn't over. Put those hairy legs on display and strut your stuff in those dresses. Get flowery ones_comma_ too!
Whoop Whoop! That's awesome! I hope you get the job.
No problem! Is this a career like job?
What show is it?
What band is it?
Yeah_comma_ it's weird going back to college.
Oh yeah_comma_ bad influences.  When I look at my student loan payments_comma_ I don't miss college.
Okay_comma_ so I never understood why people ate it. What is it about it that makes them want to do that? I just flicked mine. And I thought it stopped at a child's age. Really interesting.
I've heard of oral fixations before_comma_ but only in the context of like chewing fingernails and smoking cigarettes_comma_ etc. But I guess if I think about it_comma_ a lot of people chew fingernails_comma_ and I'm sure that's just as bad bacteria-wise. Maybe the booger eaters are on to something.
That must have been unbearable. Did you complain to the staff about the smell?
Good_comma_ I would avoid that airline too.
That is a terrible feeling. I saw a movie where a family actually left their kid at home. That would be the worst.
Well I hope everything turned out ok. Maybe you can send a friend to check your door.
Avatar the Airbender or James Cameroons Avatar?
Ah yes it has been a long time since that movie came out! It has some of the best CGI ever.
They just didnt play like a team and its no surprise that happened.
I hope so_comma_ they shouldnt be getting beat like that. 
Who was it?
Uh I would have called the police_comma_ did they have a reaon?
I wish I could relate_comma_ but I've never had to go to court. I hope it goes smoothly for you. All I've ever heard is to dress appropriately and to speak as respectfully as you can as possible. 
I hope for your sake that you don't have to_comma_ either. But this doesn't have to define you. How you respond can_comma_ though. If you're mentally tough_comma_ it will be a bump in the road. I guess do whatever you can to maintain healthy focus.
Haha good timing by your roommate. Does he not knock?
Hahahaa that's funny. I am sure you can install a lick pretty easily if the door is wooden.
I bet it brings back lots of great memories.
I do nit think I have heard of that game. Was it pretty popular?
How does that make you feel?
I am sorry_comma_ I am sure he is just being nice for the sake of not getting in trouble!
That is always a drag. I hope it is routine and nothing serious.
Oh yeah I know what you mean about hospitals. They are always so busy and you see lots of sick people.
I totally know what you mean.
You also need some good pickup lines.
Did she ever embarass you out in public?
Yikes_comma_ I hope they did not take that to heart too much...
My girls seem to like the Pokemon Go game - is this a new one?
Tell me more about it - maybe it will be something my girls will like also.
Wow! What was the dog doing or what was the show about?
Nice_comma_ I love watching cute dogs doing cool things!
That is crazy_comma_ how did they get separated?
Oh wow_comma_ best of luck with that!
I am sure you deserve it for all the hard work you do. I will send in my recommendation.
Sure_comma_ I wish there were more employees like you with such a strong work ethic.
How much money did you make with it? I assume most people would have sold before the peak out of fear of it crashing
Holy cow_comma_ congratualtions_comma_ that sure is smart of you!
Well still_comma_ it takes bravery!
Interesting...lol
I can't believe i made this much money with bitcoin.
I am so sorry. I just recently lost my mother after years of her having alzheimer's. I wish there was some way I could help you_comma_ it is such a tough road.
You are completely fine needing some time. There is nothing fair about something that takes your best friend and turns them into a stranger. Be there with her_comma_ but you have to take time to recharge yourself. No one can be strong all the time.
That game was suprising. The browns of all teams lol
Yea true and they used their back ups moostly. Foles is having a rough start.
What coaster did you ride?
I have never heard of that_comma_ is it twisty or a big drop?
I just got done traveling myself! There's no better feeling than the anticipating of traveling. I love airports_comma_ especially_comma_ because of all the people-watching and the general atmosphere. I hope your trip goes smoothly!
Oh_comma_ gotcha. My mix-up. Driving and road trips can still be just as fun. Kinda stinks if you're the only one driving_comma_ but at least you can come up with games to play. Plus.. it's cheaper. that's always nice.
Oh man I bet summer went by quick for you then.  Did you have fun together?
Yeah.  That sucks you guys are apart now :(    I'd love to do a mountain trip like that though.
It'll be OK :) How long does this busyness usually last for?
Oh that's not tooo bad...can you take your vacation during that time?
Why did you move?
oh_comma_ well it will come!
Some people have better cards then we do in life. It's how you play your cards though.
Humans can't help that. But its what makes us strive to be better!
Why did you get a cat?
They are_comma_ I hope yours behaves better in time
Why did you do that?
That is terrible_comma_ I hope things get better for you both
He should be recovered by the early part of the season.
Yeah_comma_ the Foles injury is more worrying.
It's hard for me to empathize since I'm just in college right now. But my girlfriend is in a line of work that is the same way_comma_ and I hate to see her get so stressed out and all of her time eaten away because of work. I try to give her her space and to be understanding. Hopefully people do that with you_comma_ too.
Well_comma_ if there's any way you can give them insight to what you're dealing with_comma_ so that they better understand_comma_ I would do it. My girlfriend spent 10 mins one day explaining to me what she dealt with_comma_ and it went a long way for me to not bother her as much about it
I get that_comma_ I have had jobs like that_comma_ some people just thrive on drama_comma_ they do not enjoy anything more than that
I understand that_comma_ that is a great move by you_comma_ do not get sucked in
Eh give him a dollar and tell him to enter the contest himself.
He doesn't sound too reasonable if you ask me.
I hate sayings_comma_ but the one that goes_comma_ "Tough times don't last_comma_ but tough people do_comma_" really applies. Life is long. You have plenty of time to change your fortune_comma_ and you seem self aware enough to do it. I hope you can work your way back up.
Of course_comma_ but it doesn't really matter what I say_comma_ or what I think. You already knew all that stuff anyway. Everyone has to have confidence in themselves. Someone else's confidence makes no difference. But as long as you're alive_comma_ you've got a chance.
Why is it a great day?
What type of dog is it?
Wow_comma_ that is so cute_comma_ I hope he gets trained quickly!
How did you break the TV?
Did your parents get mad at you?
Wow_comma_ I can't even imagine. What caused the fire?
Were you home when it started?
Did you study for it?
Great then! You can ace any "hard" test as long as you put in the work and time! I hope you did well.
Me too! What is your favorite part?
I agree with you. I cannot wait. It is such a fun time
Cool!  What are you all gonna do? 
That's awesome!!  I hope you have fun and be safe!
I know right_comma_ some printers are just terrible.
I can feel your frustration. 
Oh wow_comma_ I love thunderstorms.... though I know they make some people really uncomfortable. 
It's always good to be nice and prepared for anything. Better safe than sorry they always say. Good for you.
Wow...Are you ok?
Oh haha when you say pit bull i immediately think it could be a violent occurrence. I'm glad you are ok:)
I hope it works out for you!
Be a gentleman and you will be golden.
Yikes!  Did you find out who it was?
Man that's awful.  Did you file a police report?
I bet you found some cool stuff
Oh wow! Those were fun. Did you play it?
I love Legos! They have gotten expensive though.
Yeah_comma_ thinking about old toys makes me somewhat sad.
WOW!  All by himself in one sitting??
Are you hoping to do the same thing???!
Haha. Which one were you rooting for?
Were you disappointed that they lost?
Oh that's quite luck and fortunate for you_comma_ I've never had a lost wallet returned.
I don't blame you. 
Yuck!  I hate when friends do that!
Yeah I don't blame you.  Time to find some new friends!
Are you nervous?
Oh that's a standard prcedure. Have you ever had one?
Everything will be fine:)
Did you ease your nerves?
I'm glad everything worked out for you!
Sometimes solitude can be a good thing. Were you hoping for company?
Call me next time and I will go with you.
have you been contacted by the IRS?
well id say no news is good news
Awwww_comma_ that's so sad. Was he lost?
Good job! There need to be more people like you in this world.
American football or soccer?
Yeah I bet.  Are you a Browns fan or something?
That sounds like a bummer_comma_ what brand?
Too bad you don't have a pond you can throw it into.
shees! some people just dont understand some things others just dont care to talk about
it happens everywhere. some poeple are just too dense to realize . 
Wowza...how did it go?
Oh gosh....that is embarrassing. Were you able to recover? lol
What happened?
It's smart to play it safe. Sometimes we are unable to predict what other humans are capable of.
You seem very smart;0
What a loyal dog! They are such good creatures. We humans don't deserve them. 
I'm glad he was there to protect you! Hopefully it doesn't happen again because that's very scary. 
Did you take it back?
Dang.  Did you eat it or throw it away?
No_comma_ tell me about it!
Yeah_comma_ eggplant is pretty gross.
I'm so sorry to hear that. It will get better_comma_ though. 
Going to the gym or taking up a hobby can make you feel more confident and motivated.
Oh no! I am so sorry. was he old?
Wow! Sounds like he had a full life. You are a good pet owner.:)
Hey congrats!!!  Hows being a parent working
Yeah I've always heard that about kiddos.  Congrats and good luck!  I'm sure you will be an awesome parent!! :D
You're welcome.  I think I hear a baby crying.  You better go check on that :D
That must be such a relief!
In a way_comma_ it is actually just the beginning.
They didn't even eat it! How dare they!!
Did you find out who did it?
Oh_comma_ what car was it?  Are you jealous?
That is a sweet ride!
thats good! how old is he?
congratulations! parenting done right!
haha.  Where they mad?  and how did you react?
Yeah I bet.  I would be too.  How embarassing 
OH NO! How so?
Haha i agree. Hopefully you can make it through it without too much anxiety.
WOW that's always a good news! i do love my pizza_comma_ and  i am guessing you do too!
oh god! make sure you post a lot of pictures and give updates on the taste! you must be so excited
Nice! He must be pretty good.
Nice. You must be pretty happy for him. Will you go to his games?
What job are you starting?
Do you get a big raise too?
you know something worker_1_comma_ everytime you feel good about something_comma_ it always means that you did good! take for example myself_comma_ when i had my job interview i also felt really good about it and guess what? I GOT THE JOB! 
that's good news indeed! i wish you the best and make sure you work hard! 
You certainly are lucky to have a dad_comma_ me too!
I wish everyone was that lucky.
How much did you end up saving?
That's amazing_comma_ who did you switch too?
Oh_comma_ wow.  Are you happy for him?
Yeah_comma_ we all get jealous sometimes.
You are a good friend! Are you nervous?
Nice. I wish i had more friends like you.
Congratulations! What will be his name?
That is such a manly name if I ever heard one.
aww_comma__comma__comma_ poor pupper. what happend?
good vibes going out to your good boy
AYYY that's great news! was it a calculator test? or a non calculator one/
who needs a calculator with a brain like that ey? good job that's amazing news
Was she impressed?
That's a good idea_comma_ maybe take her on a cute date sometime as well?
Ouch! I am sorry to hear that!
That's just evil_comma_ no matter what the circumstances may be. I'd never do that.
the best thing a human being can do
yup_comma_ i love doing that what show did you end up watch?
Oh that's funny_comma_ I actually just had it for lunch today. I'd highly recommend it.
I think as long as you go to a trustable place (not a grocery store-style sushi joint) that makes it fresh and right in front of you_comma_ you'll be less likely to get sick (I never have).
That must have been so relaxing!
I wish summer would never end.
oh damn_comma_ what ended up happening after?
what the what? why it's not such a big deal_comma_ it happens everyday 
Oh no_comma_ what happened to your cat?
I am so sorry for your loss.
What kind of dog is it?
That's awesome that you have friends that will do that for you.
Are you ok. Did you need to go to the hospital?
I have never spilled a hot drink on myself before. Weird how that happens.
Oh no that sounds like a nightmare. Did you get it back?
Ugh that makes me so angry. I hope the police can help you out in some way.
what did they do?
ouch_comma_ that's annoying_comma_ why don't you talk to him about it?
Oh really? What was it?
That's nice. Congratulations on the gift. It's a useful one!
Which beach?!
You must be excited_comma_ have you been there before?

i love playing basketball_comma_ especially cause i have the height advantage too 
is he okay? why did you have to do that? is he awake now?
that is so sad
Uh ohhh.  When is it gonna be your turn?!
Wonder if it would help if I call your boss and tell him to give you a raise?
I will write him a strongly worded letter!
Hey we gotta get you some money somehow!
Oh that's nice! How did that go?
That's great! I bet he had a lot of fun too!
did you have fun? what did you eat? 
eating outside every once in a while can always be needed to change your mood _comma_ glad you had fun!
omg that's such an amazing news! good job! what is your next goal
oh my apologies_comma_ i misread that one_comma_ are you proud and happy for him?
WHAT! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT 
you better be! i hope you learned your lesson though_comma_ we all make mistakes but we need to learn from them 
oh really? Im not the biggest football fan
sounds like a fun time sports can get intense
I hope you do well on it.
Give it all of your best.

oh damn_comma_ that sucks so much_comma_ i am sorry_comma_ but if he is your good friend you should be happy for him_comma_ maybe something better awaits you
i know you are_comma_ and it takes a lot of practice to remove this feeling_comma_ but it's a bad feeling to have and you should look for other chances
That can be daunting. I hope you are prepared.
That will be great. Soon we will be able to call you Attorney At Law. It's so exciting.
Yeah_comma_ kids grow up so fast these days.
I don't like thinking about the past for that very reason.
are you excited for this?
you should be more confident in your abilities! i am sure you'll make an amazing bean dip
How exciting? What position will he be playing?
That is always so much fun_comma_ and the kids love having people there to watch them. 
Me too_comma_ and good luck to him.
that's good_comma_ the first week is always the hardest_comma_ but it get's easier and funnier as time goes by
best of luck to you! i hope everything goes well

i am sorry again_comma_ what are you hoping to do now? 
were you in a hurry to be somewhere?
hmmm but why did you go 1 mile over/
Wow_comma_ how long ago was that? I wish it still was.
I'd definitely agree to that. Better times.
Oh cool! Which one did you get?
Wow_comma_ I just got the NES one.  They are so nostalgic.
aww that's so sweet of you to do_comma_ did she enjoy that?
even the smallest things can make the biggest different in the world! she is lucky to have a person like you
i did also . it was fun
yes. the good ol days
That is the confidence to have!
I hope you ace that test!

I think that's a wonderful attitude to have!
I hope they are as well. I do love some fishing.
Oh my_comma_ what did you see?  A mess I presume?
Oh no that is definitely something you don't want to be surprised by.
what happend? tell me
that's sad news_comma_ i am sorry for this news you must have been extra drained after coming back from work from that news
I'm sorry_comma_ who was Stefan?
Oh okay_comma_ now I know.  Yeah that was tragic.
yikes that pretty bad
yea i know what you mean
Oh no that is horrible! Did you call the police?
That's good. I'm sorry that terrible thing happened to you.
oh man. i dont like the dentist . is it a normal cleaning and check up or something more?
i would be too!
well_comma_ that sounds good_comma_ hopefully there won't be a lot of pain.
it'll be fine. don't worry.
why did you do that? wasn't there a toilet or something?
that must've been embarrassing. you should've went to the toilet.
oh what went wrong?
thats a fuckin bummer_comma_ hope you left her
It's always great to have friends that are willing to help out when you need them the most.
When are you expecting to move?
thats sounds horrifying
hopefully nothing too bad happened
Ah that sucks. Did they have a good reason to do so?
Yes I would be too. I'd let my friend know that I don't appreciate being treated that way.
Were you able to replace it before he found out?
I think that would be the best option.  Nothing worse to be thirsty and have your taste buds set on something and it's not there.
Ah yes_comma_ do other members cause some trouble for you?
That is indeed frustrating. A little appreciation and recognition is what they need to give you I think.
why did you have to send it back? what happend
good thing you returned it! rare or whatever they call it meat is actually very dangerous for you espcially coming from a restaurant good thing you did that!
not cool! i love monsters! i hate when my girlfriend takes the last one
that is good to hear!
What's that?
What kind is it?  I have a bad one too by the way.
Are you going to be on the news when you win??
Yeah!  When you win I get first crack at your autograph!
thats nice to hear
oh really? I just had some myself today_comma_ love sushi
That sounds like it was a gross situation. I bet it has hard to clean.
It can always happen with pets and it is a drag to clean_comma_ I know. My dog has done it more than once.
How did you do on your test?  Did you find out?
What course did you test for?
thats awesome good for you
im glad thats the case
oh god that's annoying_comma_ the same thing happned to me for my iphone case_comma_ they got me the smaller one isntead of the normal big size one_comma_ so annoyed
ayyy that's a win isn't it? but still annoying but  at least you getting it for free now
sounds like youre going on vacation!
where are you going? i haven't taken a vacation in a long time
grandma's food always brings back memories_comma_ for some reasons they taste very nostalgic.
it was so simple back then right? not having to worry about anything but enjoying life.
oh really? that's very coincidental because my son also started football this year are you happy?
i know! they grow so fast and i didn't think i'd use that overly used word but god it's so true
Oh that's awful!  Maybe you can try to return it and say it came like that LOL
It's a little funny
That's great! It feels good when you can get a little back from the things you have invested so much in!
Definitely! Plus_comma_ gets some of the clutter out of your home_comma_ I guess to make room for more.
WHAT WAS THE SHOCK?
oh my god! that's so bad what did you do ?
Why?  What is going on?
Sounds like you need a vacation
what makes you think so? i'm pretty sure you aren't.
that doesn't make you a failure! you are doing more than enough and i'm pretty sure she appreciate every single thing you're doing for her.
Oh wow!  Congrats!!  What are you hoping for?
That is so awesome!  How old are they?
its always good to get away and reset
did you make a check list and double check it?
I'm sorry?  What happened?
That's awful.  I hate when that happens. 
really? like how? what she do?
don't worry_comma_ with people like this karma hits them very very hard_comma_ and they get what they deserve 
Were you driving or walking?
I hope they caught the person who almost hit you. That kind of incident can leave you traumatized for a long time.
oof thats not a fun siutation
thats a vivid description haha
that's nice_comma_ wanna share this wonderful experience with me?
wow! that is such a wonderful thing to do indeed! i am proud of you
That's amazing! I do not (so far) but i hope to some day.
Thanks! I appreciate it. I am really happy for you though! That's one of the best things to feel in life I am sure.
Oh wow_comma_ that must have been scary!  I'm terrified of snakes!
The only time I've seen one up close is when a professional was handling one.  I prefer to keep a distance.
did you call the police? or did you do what needed to be done?
well _comma_ glad it wasn't something important. it was just a cat. and you are safe. so that is great!
What if what?  What has you so fearful?
Maybe a career in astro-physics is in your future?
wow! that's amazing what did she do?
oh god yes_comma_ they grow so fast next thing you know she's taking care of you and you are all old haha it's so wonderful
That's great! Is there a particular reason_comma_ or just in general?
that's so great! cONGRATS!
Any particular reason that made you do that?
Right_comma_ well we can all get that way sometimes. I'd just tell your friend directly that you weren't feeling up to it.
thats really nice
sushi is the best
Is there no way to get in touch with anyone?
Why are you alone in a room? Do you need me to come over?
really? why is that?
wow! that is next level smartness and thinking! good job
i am lucky to have someone like my fiancee too! what makes you so grateful about your fiancee
it's probably the best feeling on earth right?
thats super cool
thats impressive good luck to her
I can't wait either_comma_ I am looking forward to it as well.  Do you know when the release date is?
CoD 4 comes out in about two weeks I think.
i agree. everyone seems to be out for themself and do not care to help other or take others into consideration
yeah its a tought thing to have to deal with
oh god! how much did he rip you off by?
oh_comma_ so what are you going to do about this?
this happens a lot at work_comma_ maybe try to talk to them about it? 
i agree everyone is just self-centered and it's very annoying to communicate with those people.
How do you feel about it? Ready?
Just do your best you can_comma_ and that way you won't have any regrets no matter what the result is.
oh thats cool
yea i know that feel its the same for me right now
You must really trust them. I hope it turned out well.
Now you know who to call when you want to go away again.
Oh yeah my brother would always get some things I wanted too. Made me feel jealous. 
That's even worse. Well I hope you at least got to ride it when she wasn't looking!
oh wow that sounds nice
i just did last week actually
oh no! why didn't you do anything about it?
snitch? is that actually still a thing?
oh wow! what was the discovery?
mind. blown. that sounds breath taking
oh god! that must have been so scary 
oh god! just hand them what they want_comma_ it's not worth your life
wow thats very faithful of you
not really but i can respect it
awww that's so sweet of them_comma_ are you guys close?
that's so nice_comma_ are you looking forward to uni?
yep almost everyday because of my fiancee. what about you?
i know_comma_ there's nothing like true love .
As in a grade?
That can happen sometimes even when you are prepared. It's like test anxiety. Has it happened before?
How did you end up doing?
How well? I'm proud of you for that my man.
what? what did you do/
that's so nice! good thing you do_comma_ we need more people like you_comma_ all these normies nowadays just sleeping around and only chasing after cannibalistic desires  
What happened!
You must be upset_comma_ are you okay do you need any help?
oh did it go well?
huh sounds quite intimate
Are you nervous of meeting new friends?
I think you should look to join a club in school!
yes! i live about 30 mins away from the coast . i love going at night
yes_comma_ i love when the water is flat and its just a glassy reflection. i also love when the water is rough and loug
aww that's so nice! did you have the biggest smile on your face/
that makes me so happy! you blessed my day! i can't wait to see my son do that too
why was he beating you?
oh what an abusive person_comma_ how did yo ustop him?
I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ can you make it up to them?
You should try to reach out to them.
i hope it wasn't an important and you still managed to pass everything. why did that happen?
don't worry about it_comma_ maybe it was the teacher's fault . but since you're okay and everything is fine there's no point in worrying about it.
Tell me what has you so worked up?
I am so sorry. I know right now your mind is spinning and everything is chaotic. You need to sit somewhere and let your mind settle down.
That's a good idea_comma_ what do you need to buy?
That's smart_comma_ I love a big turkey dinner the family will be pleased I bet.
What did you decide to do instead?
That's lucky of you_comma_ do you plan on being a pharmacy tech?
what else would you do if you didnt go?
that sounds like good money
Did you try going to any clubs to meet anyone?
You should consider trying to network though it's worth it.
why is that?
thats nice of you
why does it creep you out? i think it's pretty good
you could always try sushi bowls. 
why is that? what happend?
it's okay! if you really want to do it you will do it strength isn't all physical your real strength is the will to do! if you have that_comma_ the 15 push ups can be turned to 100!
Just once. If the car had not died I would have hit a building.
I know that feeling for sure. I freaked out because I could not remember how to use the brake. 
Did you make it home in time?
That is so lame_comma_ what caused you to be so late? Just the lights?
awww_comma_ that's so sweet i aspire to be like you with my fiance_comma_ i will sooon get married! what re you guys planning to do? and what's your guys secret for holding a relationship for so long?
i know she is the one_comma_ we are identical in every way_comma_ i am the only person who understands her and she is the only one who understands me_comma_ we communicate about everything and we are both non normies!
what did he won? were you hoping for some help?
it's insane how people can be so selfish once they see money_comma_ een your own father becomes a monster. don't let it bother you.
yikes! that's a load to clean isn't it?
i know! my cats are a hell to take care of as well_comma_ one always poops in the kitchen while the other one chases off my pigeons_comma_ it's really annoying
what letter? please share this experience with me
oh wow! that is such good news! i am so happy for you_comma_ what are you going to study there?
wow that's so motivating to hear_comma_ what inspires you to become a police officer
yeah_comma_ i hope you be one of the good cops_comma_ not like the current ones
did you just move back?
i miss waking up to my moms big breakfasts. i actually live a block away from her
What kind of restaurant was it?
I do love a good burrito_comma_ I should go check it out some time.
go on! tell me about it_comma_ let's hear it
what ended up happening?
that's so disgusting you are disgusting
how long did you have your dog for? that must've been very painful_comma_ losing a pet is always hard
that's a lot of time. you could say he was part of your family. 
With those kind of people you just have to be blunt. If that doesn't work then it's time to excuse yourself from the conversation.
You are usually left with no other option.
were they good memories?
yes i love that feeling
Oh_comma_ I"m sorry to hear that! I know how hard that can be to lose a loved pet.
Well_comma_ I hope you feel better soon!
How exciting! What is he planning on doing next?
That's impressive_comma_ is he hoping to play professionally?
fun jobs with good pay do exist
that does make sense
Oh_comma_ it's crazy what some people will try. But_comma_ sometimes an argument can get very interesting to watch!
I don't really blame the driver. Plus_comma_ that's annoying delay in everybody's busy day.
I understand! I felt the same when my son left_comma_ it's seems so much less noise and talk.
I understand! I felt the same when my son left_comma_ it's seems so much less noise and talk.
A good friend is hard to find.
Do you have a best friend?
How long have you been friends?
Yeah but we aren't as close as we used to be.
yes. this situation happened every friends relation.due to this we are in relation with a family members
don't worry all the friends are came to you be happy
yes_comma_ one friend
2 years later i spoke to him
that could def be an improvemnt. what kind did you have in mind
good choices. which are you leaning towards?
Was it a suprise?
Where is he living now? Have you heard from him at least?
i really do hate that stuff
its a sick sad world
I know you have really been looking forward to this. Where did you decide on going?
My niece went there and loved it. Are you flying in or taking a cruise?
Were you able to return it?
Does it fit. Id just have them send me a new one when it comes back in stock. Its their mistake.
did he go home with you?
boo. poor pupper
Oh_comma_ no! Well_comma_ it happens sometimes_comma_ we get so busy and don't notice. 
Life gets us out of whack_comma_ don't feel bad. I'm sure you can pay for it next time.
that's fantastic! It certainly is a great feeling_comma_ financial freedom!
That's so great!
left until what?
that sounds like a lot of fun
What was sketchy about it?
Yikes.  Did you end up placing the order?
What was it it?
You cant be serious.
You definitely made my day.
Well good luck with whatever is out there.
Are you currently saving up?
I bet.  How far south of the continent are you?
Cool.  I have a friend that lives in Brazil
Thats awesome!!  Tell Gabi I said hi when you go :D
That's a good thing. Lying to the police opens a whole world of trouble.
Especially if it involves going to jail.
How did you cut your hand?
Did you lose any fingers?
Did you get hurt doing the robbery?
How long ago did this occur?
Are you going because someone else wants to or was it something that you wanted to do?
If you don't have any choice then I suggest you bring earplugs.
Oh no did people look at you judgingly?
Well you can learn from it_comma_ and be better for it.
Whow! That is one mean car!   What did your friend say?
That must be quite exciting to drive around in those supercars!
That is great. What are you studying?
Good luck
Whats the distance?
How does one prepare for a marathon? By running? 
What kind of feelings?
More than anything?! More than cats?? You must really love her!
I hope you didn't listen to them.
Nice_comma_ you must do whatever you want each day.
Hopefully all of your hard work will pay off and you will do well.
All you can do is do your best and whatever happens after that at least you will know that you gave it your all.
I understand. Did you finally took them skating?
I understand. Those things happened.
Did you run into any problems?
That's a lot of questions. How did the rest of the trip turn out?
Is it your first time there?
I do love a good beach_comma_ I was just in the Philippines and they have some of the best beaches Ive ever seen.
That was nice of you. Is she still alive?
Sorry about her death. At least you enjoyed your time with her.
How that happened?
Maybe your cat started a family somewhere in nature)
Do you know who stole it?
Maybe it will turn up_comma_ who knows.
Are you playing?
I understand. What is the name of your team?
WHat kind of car is it?
That is one awesome car!  Don't be too jealous!  Just start saving your money!
Wow. That sounds exciting. You should do fine.
What kind of motorcycle did you buy?
About to_comma_ what happened?
Is your name Kim by any chance?
Uhoh.  I'm assuming it was not safely returned to you?
Fanny packs for the win!
Yes but that is how it goes sometimes.
All you can do it work hard and try to make more money.
That is great. Are you working?
Is it a little bit complicated to have two jobs?
You are wonderful just the way you are! Be happy that you are alive and healthy and beautiful! I am sure your brother wishes he could have something of yours too.
It is all in your head. What makes you think being tall is any funner? :)
I hope you had insurance.
Sure_comma_ it must be a real pain to be in your imaginary shoes.
Oh I hope nothing bad came from that?
Yeah that can be stressful.
That's really hard to do. I should do the same thing_comma_ but I still start my day with a big glass of iced coffee every day. It could help though.
I can imagine. That is really great that you are able to follow his advice and maybe each day will get a little bit better. Anxiety is the worst!
Good luck. What class?
Whats your major?
Sometime you got to pay for quality.
Hopefully you can save up and get a pair.
I hope you did. Is it one that you really wanted ?
Patience paid off for you then hopefully.
I am sorry to hear that. I am sure you be fine.
We all go through tough times. It will work out for you in the end.
Wow_comma_ what a thrilling sport. Yeah_comma_ I sure hope he knows what he's doing. You life depends on it!
You are certainly brave my friend. I don't have the guts to ever do that! Be safe!
Why can't you play? That must be very disappointing.
Ouch! I'm so sorry. How long until you can play again?
haha_comma_ why did you go on?  peer pressure?
That makes sense!  I bet it didn't go as bad as you think!
Is that good or bad?
Maybe you should child proof the house.
I know. Those were the days. 
I liked going to Blockbuster picking out movies.
That sucks_comma_ did the house get any damage?
That is good_comma_ at least you were prepared.
That's great_comma_ hope you get it! But_comma_ seems you have much on your plate already.
Oh_comma_ I see_comma_ well that sounds better for sure. Good luck_comma_ and I hope you will get it.
Oh_comma_ no. Do you have a plan B ?
Think of it this way. If you had waited_comma_ you wouldn't have been able to get the house. Dig in and fight too keep it.
That is no good!  Why have you been feeling so sad and depressed?
Wow!  That does sound like a lot of misfortune!  Just try your best to think positive if you can.  You never know what the future has in store for you!
That must have been so cool to drive around in a ferrari. Was it fun?
I bet. What color Ferrari do you have? Be careful not to drive to fast now
Oh no! He doesn't seem like such a good friend then. I hate it when friends pull stuff like that!
That sucks! He definitely appears he was trying to avoid you. Well one day he will need something and you can give him a taste of his own medicine. lol 
That is terrible. Did you call the police?
I understand. I hate when that happened.
That is so scary. Did he destroy anything?
I would have been too. Was there more than one?
Most people do not possess those qualities these days.  That is quite honorable of you.  Being faithful is quite important!
You should be.  I am sure your family appreciates it as well!
I understand_comma_ my parents are 85 and 88_comma_ both with dementia.
I'm glad it's that way for you. My parents destroyed my life intentionally years ago.
Nice! Sounds like you will be successful then! I think you will do great!
Hahaha_comma_ nerds are cool these days_comma_ haven't you heard? Sounds like you are on the road to success!
That must be very difficult to have to wait for results. I hope they come back and everything is fine though.
Yes_comma_ that is not fun at all. I've been there and it's hard not to think about anything else. I really wish you the very best
That's so great!  You seem quite content.
That's so cool.  I think I would feel the same way_comma_ except I was dumb in my 20s and still have student debt!  lol
That's interesting.  Why on Earth would she want it back?
That is crazy!  There has to be an explaination!
I'm in that boat right now too. I feel it's going to be a long time coming.
I hope you can hang on for something better.
I dont have any kids. I want to adopt one day.
Im happy for you.
Yeah_comma_ it was fun...and so free.
I lived in an apartment complex and there was a pool_comma_ so I loved swimming.
There is nothing better than being content.
That makes you feel safe.
Oh yikes! That is a scary thing to witness. It is good to be safe these days with so many people using phones while driving and even walking. It is dangerous out there and you never know what can happen to you at any moment.
Yes_comma_ be safe my friend! I am sure you will because of your hands on experience with what you saw.
That's not good!  Have you considered going to rehab?
Maybe a different facility could help?  Addiction isn't something you can deal with by yourself. 
What did you? Did you return to the store?
I understand.
Did you have any money bet on it ?
Well_comma_ then it wasn't too bad.
Not quite sure I get what youre saying. Lost as in missing?
Wow. Sorry to hear. I dont know too much about dementia. 
Oh_comma_ it happens to the best of us. I have done the same a gazillion times! It doesn't get any better or funnier_comma_ lol.
Oh well_comma_ just know that everybody in the world has fallen a few times. The most important thing is you just get up and keeping walking. :)
Was it a large one ?
I'm happy for you.
That is great. Is it a big one?
Wow. It is a great raise. Your employer should have impressed by you.
Oh_comma_ wow_comma_ that is absolutely terrible! I can imagine it was horrifying for you.
Was he dead_comma_ or just injured badly? I wouldn't be sure what to really do either. 
Uh oh! That is not a good sign! Do you think they are going to call it quits?
It is good to have these kinds of keep sakes. Maybe the rings can even be used again in a family wedding.
that sounds like it is going to be a super trip_comma_ you'll have a blast
Boston is a great place to visit_comma_ makes sure you have some chowdah  :)
Yes_comma_ death is always a tough thing to deal with especially when they are close like parents. But that life and every single person on this planet will have to deal with that at some point in life. It is just the nature of life.
Oh_comma_ what a bad pain to carry. I hope that you are happy though. Your parents will want you to always stay happy.They are in a better place now.
Oh_comma_ how cute! I love animals_comma_ especially puppies!
Oh_comma_ yuck! They will do that_comma_ but sure don't want puppy kisses later.
That's good. I know it's very expensive to replace that part_comma_ so I'm sure you are relieved.
Yes_comma_ for sure! I always prefer repairs over replacement if possible.
That would make me nervous! you never know what kind of person it could be_comma_ a predator perhaps.
True!
That is always a great feeling! I love gardening! What did you plant?
Oh yum!! That should grow nicely this time of year. You should definitely can all the extra tomatoes you get this year. It will be great in winter soups and stews. :)
I am sorry to hear about all the layoffs.  I will pray for you at Church for you to keep your job.  What do you do for work?
How long have you been an accountant?
The weather is terrible here also. I hate that. Are you on the east side of America?
That is bad. What are you planning to do the rest of the day?
Oh that is a tough period. Poor baby! But with mammas love everything is alright. You are such a great mother!
Yeah_comma_ hopefully they have invented something that helps with the pain for the teething. Hopefully is is natural.
Oh no! That's terrible. What made you choose that stock_comma_ and what will you do now?
You'll earn it all back_comma_ don't worry. For next time_comma_ though_comma_ don't listen to people who know nothing.
That's great! Did you win your fight.
Congrats! You trained for it so you deserved to win!
That's great! I love soccer. I grew up in Scotland_comma_ where everyone's golf and soccer crazy. How old is your son?
I bet that makes you so proud. Perhaps he'll become a professional soccer player one day!
Oh no!! I hope it wasn't coffee! Yes that is pretty embarrassing. People probably thought you peed your pants.
Oh_comma_ well hopefully you learned some kind of lesson from this and it won't happen again.
Oh yeah. Was the food good? What about the service?
Oh my gosh! What where they serving? That makes me feel sick for you. I hate being decieved!
I hate aggressive drivers. They cause the majority of the accidents.
He probably had no where to go important. He was just being rude.
That sounds like fun. What were you taking pictures of? I didn't know film existed anymore lol
Do you take pictures professionally or just a hobby?
First Im sorry for your heartbreak_comma_ but second... its okay to be alone to let the feelings pass. How long has it been? 
sounds like its time to get out and start doing something to take your mind off from it. maybe fitness? 
That is great. What is it a big amount that you had to pay back?
I hate having debts. 
Awe_comma_ that is a very good friend to have. You are very lucky to have a friend like that. Hopefully you are there for him too. :)
Count your lucky stars my friend! Bless you heart!
That's great. It really feels great when we accomplish something and reach our goals.
I hope you do as well_comma_ that will be a big step towards a great career.
That was nice of you. I hope she gave it back to you when you needed to use it yourself.
That is very kind of you. There needs to be more people like you in the world!
And did he pull through?
I love it whern
Did you all have a good time there?
Haha! Rollercoasters are an exhilarating experience! I love riding them at amusement parks.
Oh my...You have to be careful when you use the internet for school assignments.
I know someone else that happened to. I wouldn't take anymore chances either.
Weekends are beautiful if you don't work on them and have nothing to do!
Enjoy the weekend as much as you can for me; I work all day today!
That sounds very scary_comma_ what happened? 
Smart move honestly_comma_ better to be with a larger group than to be alone. Glad you are ok. 
How are you still friends?
I have a few friends who are way better off than I am. It makes me a bit sad about my situation. 
That's cool! Maybe he will be the Magic Johnson of the family. Hey you never know!
Yeah all you can do is encourage and support him. I hope everything works out and that he becomes rich and famous someday! 
It's great looking through old photo albums and remembering all those great times.
Yeah it really is. We just slap everything on our computer or online these days. It's just not the same.
Hey it happens to the best of us. Were you able to clean it up well?
Oh no that's awful! I hadn't realized it was carpet. As a clumsy person_comma_ that could've definitely been me in your situation so I get it.
That's great to hear. Was it a boy or a girl?
Children are so amazing_comma_ and life changing. I hope your sister is ready for all the challenges that awake her.
Oh really?! What did they find?
Oh yuck!!! That is terrible! I have heard of people getting really sick from this black mold in the house. What are you going to do?
I hate spiders. There is nothing worse than waking up and seeing one above you on the ceiling as you are laying in bed.
Well that sounds terrible. It is time to burn your house down and start a new life elsewhere.
And how did you feel about taking another person's forgotten belongings?
That's a good way of seeing it I suppose.
sounds like it going to be an interesting trip
i can imaging the anticipation_comma_ but before you know it_comma_ you'll be on the beach
Congratulations! I fail to see the relevance between having a good grade and shopping however. Are you being rewarded for your grades?
Oh definitely! I hope your shopping day exceeds your expectations!
Was he using it or something? Why did you think it was him_comma_ and how did you find out it was you?
You have a secret spot for your headphones. Are they super expensive? 
I have zero kids. I break stuff all the time. 
No just ridiculously careless.
I've never been there. I think it would be intimidating.
My dad and uncle actually went camping down there. You go with a guide and you set up camp in a few different places.
Im the same_comma_ but I think in a place like the grand canyon_comma_ it's really dangerous to try to go down there alone.
Yes_comma_ I know I wouldn't mind riding the donkey or mule down there.
Good luck. I hope you do really well during the interview.
It sounds like the job is a great fit for you. I really hope you get it.
Oh no that's terrible! Did you end up finding her purse?
I'm so sorry to hear that. Hopefully your niece feels better now and hasn't lost too much.
Oh dear. I am so sorry that happened to you. Were you hurt?
That must have been terrifying. I am glad that you are okay.
That is so annoying. Did you need it for a special occasion?
I hope they at least gave you your money back.
Sorry to hear that. I lost both my grandparents in the same year.
From what year?
I know what you mean. Me too! What was your favorite part about the 90s?
Good point!
How come? Is your sister a minor and are you an adult?
That doesn't sound fair at all_comma_ I wonder why she did that.
If I were you_comma_ I would ask your mom why she paid for your sisters; items and not yours. That's so mean.
Now that I think of it_comma_ it most likely is the reason why; maybe she doesn't even think of it as a mean act and maybe means no harm by it. Regardless it is important to share how you're feeling with her.
That could be creepy depending on the person. I'm extra paranoid though.
That's understandable_comma_ there's just no way to be sure what a stranger's intentions are.
That's great! Consistency is key!
And you're building trust with your dog as well! It's a win-win. :)
Kids like touching and looking at things_comma_ I'm sure no real harm was done. People like making a big deal out of everything.
I'd say ignore them as best as you can. It's normal for kids to do these kind of things!
I am happy for you. How did it feel
That sounds like a great experience
I am usually that way_comma_ whenever I have a doctor's appointment. I hope everything went well.
Ah. There you go so you were worried about nothing. I am glad that all was well.
Oh_comma_ that's a shame - cooking's such fun. Why did you stop cooking?
Gosh_comma_ I couldn't afford to do that! It's far cheaper for me to cook up a big pot of stew or something and freeze it for busy days.
That stuff's hard to come by! It's so easy to chuck stuff in a pot and then go watch tv or do something else for a couple of hours. Tastes better_comma_ too!
I wish I had a slow cooker. Or one of those Instant Pots everyone's raving about.
It
It's weird the way some things from our past seem so timeless. It's nice you had a good experience seeing your school. 
Our past can be a great source of strength and comfort. 
Would you be able to go meet him instead?
That sucks. I would be disappointed also. Hopefully yall can make some time soon to get together.
Did you get any news back?
I hope you do get the job_comma_ you deserve it!
sorry to here that_comma_ it must be tough for you at this moment
but as time passes you will find another and be cheerful as ever.
Oh my dad loves football too. I bet you have some great memories.
Did you and your dad ever play football together?
Do you have a patio or backyard to do that in?
I am so jealous of you then ha
You must have been really prepared to be so certain of achieving a perfect score!
I hope you do get that perfect score_comma_ you deserve it after all!
That is really neat do you have a kid?
I would go atleast you would get cake
Wow! Is that old for an iguana? Im sorry to hear that
My daughter wants an iguana. I am scared of animals 
She is . She may be able to handle it on her own. Thanks for the info
That can be frustrating. Did you do anything to help?
Oh that is terrible_comma_ cashiers should have more patience.
Was the cake that good_comma_ or were you trying to make him angry?
Maybe you could make it up to him. I'm sure he'll get over it though. 
I guess he really need it. Did you give him the money? 
Well_comma_ at least you gave him something. He could buy a burger at McDonald's
Did she end up being able to go?
Well I hope she is able to attend_comma_ if not_comma_ you know it's nothing personal!
I dislike people who do that. I never understood why! Have you tried talking to him?
Oh I believe you. Typically those type of people aren't people you can reason with.
I do that sometimes to you_comma_ memories are always nice
I look forward to that when I have a kid
Is it your birthday?
That's nice. I wish my brothers did that for me.
What kind of event is it?
Ohh fun_comma_ I love the artistic nature of some. My daughter just got a tattoo in honor of me.
That happened to me once. It was terrifying. Were you okay?
That is true. We dont get a lot of snow here. I dont think anyone knows how to deal with it
How did you end up doing?
Wow_comma_ that is unfortunate_comma_ I hope you are okay financially...
What did he get you instead?
Thats not ok I have been in that situation before and have made my girlfriend a card_comma_ wrote her a poem something. 
That is not cool at all. Why would he say that? Maybe he misplaced it.
That must have made you feel angry. I am sorry that happened to you but please forgive him.
I love good books_comma_ what was it about?
That sounds really deep and dramatic_comma_ I think I would like that one. You might like books like "The Deep End of the Ocean" also.
I love sitting on the porch when the weather is nice.
Where I live_comma_ it was really nice too. There was a cool breeze and no mosquitoes out.
I imagine that would be a bit unnerving. It being dark and anything being possible.
That sounds creepy_comma_ I would have to start keeping protection with me just in case.
Did she accept? I'm sure you would be great to go out with.
I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sure you will find someone who feels the same about you.
My parents are no longer living
Its okay_comma_ I have good memories
really _comma_me going to get relax by having beer
yeah_comma_well i am not a reader but i love to play video games so much 
That is good_comma_ is he struggling now?
Did you ask him about it_comma_ or did he make a big change to high school. Sometimes a big change or just burn out can kick in.
Did you get hurt?
I know the feeling. Did a lot of people see?
Love is a great thing for sure
I am with you on that one
Uh oh. Do you think it is something major?
Well I hope it isnt too expensive. Maybe it will be a smaller issue.
That's fantastic! Hopefully you'll hear something about it soon. 
I'm sure you did. Think positive!
How old was it ?
That's terrible. I'm so sorry. You'll never forget him.
Why do you feel that way?
I am so sorry. I hope you can make friends_comma_ try to join some sort of activities to meet people.
Are you a browns fan ?
I see_comma_ well then I'm sorry that worked out wrong for you.
What problems do you need to handle?
I got you_comma_ well I hope that you get to that position at some point soon!
I do understand what you are saying. There are good cops and bad cops.
And sometimes it has to do with race_comma_ it is really a sad situation.
I hate when that happens
Damn that sucks.  Well at least you can get a fresh pair
That sounds so fun! I always wanted to get a tattoo!
I know. I have a friend who has both arms covered.
What kind of cake was it
That sounds so good
How did that make you feel
Its nice to be alone sometimes
Has he been sick?
I hope he is okay. 
What kind was it?
Those are pretty nice trucks ;/
What kind of business is it
I might need to apply then!
I love buffets. What kind of food did they have?
It happens to the best of us. At least you were able to get more since it was a buffet.
Happens to the best of us
There are still some nice people left.
That is the best way to feel during an interview. Im sure you did a good job.
Ill keep my fingers crossed for you.
Where are you going
That sounds so fun
Wow! How traumatizing! Were you scared at that time? 
Oh man_comma_ I think your mother regretted that after knowing she almost hurt her family. That is quite awful to think about.
That's cool.  What was the last thing they did for you
Wow that's pretty aweseome...you must have put in a lot of hard work to earn it
Why is that?
I suppose that is true to an extent_comma_ that makes sense
congratulations. sounds like you aced it
i bet you will make a great bartender_comma_ maybe one of these days you will hook me up with a free drink
That's terrible!  I can't imagine how hard that is.
That's very sweet of you.  She's going to need her friends to help her through this!
That is awesome! How much did you win?
That is absolutely amazing! Lucky you
Aw I'm sorry to hear that. I bet you have a lot of good memories.
I remember my dad watching football so much as a kid. I used to get so bored.
Did it hurt though
I am sorry_comma_ I would cuss too if it happened to me
Aw that's cute. Father-son/Father-daughter bonding moments are something I miss out on.
It sounds like you and your father got along well_comma_ and that isn't always the case in families. I'm happy to hear that.
That is so scary. I don't know what I would have done_comma_
You did the right thing. I wouldn't have been able to stop thinking about it.
That must be a wonderful feeling_comma_ now you are on your own.
Ah_comma_ so you are now a loner_comma_ you should try to make friends.
Where did you go?
 yeah I got to a few places like that
Oh awesome! What are the tickets for?
That will be fun.
Oh that sounds dramatic. How did it turn out?
I'm glad you worked it out!
A new job can be a little nerve wracking. Did it get better_comma_ once you settled in?
That's great. It sound like it's really working out for you. 
I wish I was that lucky! I always lose.
That is worse. I would have been so jealous and annoyed.
That sucks. Did you have a hard time with it?
Maybe you can get a tutor this time.
You could always start saving now
You can if you want
That is great!  Are you really excited?
I hope your date goes well!  Stay optimistic and positive!
Awesome! you are extremely lucky. Will you be bringing anyone with you.
Duh! You better_comma_ I do hope you have a whale of a time. I would be elated.
Wow that is a predicament 
That was probably a good idea
Oh my gosh! That is so funny. Was he really embarrassed?
I can understand that. But its still really funny. My husband is the one to get more embarrassed over things like that.
Awww! Sounds like you're a great parent!
I hope I can be a mom someday!
How do you think you did?
Well I hope it works out for you!
I am glad you met someone.
Everyone needs close friends to talk to and hangout with.
Did they knock and leave?
You should put a camera there. You can see it from your phone.
Are you excited or dreading it?
Good for you. I hope you get a good start.
awesome_comma_ whens' the first date?
Aweomse_comma_ always great to see people forming new relationships.
Ouch! Did you trip over a cord?
Did you hurt yourself?
Oh yeah? I'm guessing you're not a big fan of roller coasters?
Aww I'm sorry you didn't like it. Roller coasters can be pretty scary_comma_ even for people like me who enjoy them.
That's great!  Did you win it on a table game or at a machine?
Did you stop playing after that or did you try to win more?
I understand.  I play every now and again and I usually quit while I'm ahead.  It always ends up that I'm waiting on my friends to lose all their money so we can go home!
Yeah - the first time I went with friends_comma_ I won 100 bucks but ended up giving it back to the casino.  I told myself that if I won money like that again_comma_ I'd just stop and take the money home.  It works out well!
Does he do that often that is not ok
Yeah that is really not ok
Oh wow. I have never done that
Well that is great. I think people get upset over other people actions when it comes to facebook.
What kind of puppy did you get?
Those are \big right?
Accidents happen. Are you feeling better.
I heard that was going around.
Yikes.  I'm sorry to hear.  Will there be other chances available for promotion?
I'd be pretty upset_comma_ too.  Did anyone give a reason why your coworker was chosen over you?
What is dove season?
Oh!  I didn't know people hunted them!  What is used to hunt them?  Shotguns?
You sound confident. What subject is the class? 
Awesome. I'm sure you'll do well then.
That is so nice you must be really looking forward to that. Will you be traveling alone?
Make sure you take lots of pictures and prepare for the weather.
You must have been really scare!  Could you sleep after that?
I imagine_comma_  I am easily scared with these kind of movies_comma_ so I don't watch them much.
That's cool what's your favorite part about it
Nice_comma_ you're never too old to go trick or treating haha
Were you competing?
Thats too bad. What do you do now?
How did you like it?
Great!  A new look can certainly help feel refreshed_comma_ at leas it does it for me.
Are you planning to attend?
I hope you have a great time!
You are a loyal friend. I do hope your friend will learn from his mistakes.
Yes_comma_ i have that one friend and you don't want to give up on him. I hope he gets it together soon
That's cool. What kind of benefits
That's great. Do they offer dental and vision
Bahamas is a nice Caribbean island_comma_ you must be really looking forward to it.
I can just imagine_comma_ make sure you take lots of pictures and dress for the weather. It will be hot. 
That was so nice of him!
You are lucky to have a nice dad.
what did you end up doing?
Oh_comma_ well I hope it works out well for you!
I'm so sorry to hear that. Death is never easy to deal with.
I hope all your family was doing well.
How odd. Sounds like a scam.
Did you look into the situation further? Did you call your phone company and see what they had to say about it?
That's a good thing. A lot of people (like me!) hate/hated it. She'll do so much better if she's happy.
How old is she? Is she studying something she can use later in life?
Oh_comma_ well goodness_comma_ encourage her! The sooner she starts learning to love to learn the more joy she'll get out of it!
No_comma_ it certainly isn't! Hopefully_comma_ she'll keep loving it and will love learning for the rest of her life. Think what a gift that must be!
That's a good idea. It's best to be prepared for a dangerous weather situation_comma_ as you never know when it can happen.
Yes_comma_ as a wife and mother_comma_ I know I usually look to my husband for guidance and strength in situations like that!
I feel sure as well_comma_ you are clearly determined and intentional.
That's the beauty of it_comma_ I feel motivated now so I need to keep an eye out on my local job market.
Pro's and Con's.  Those systems are abuse prone but_comma_ some people need them.
It can be infuriating.  For example_comma_ over a 3 year period in my own state_comma_ there was about ~20 million dollars worth of food stamps spent in major vacation hot spots (florida_comma_ hawaii_comma_ california_comma_ virgin islands)
Why didn't you go
Or it could be you and a dope house party
Or it could be you and a dope house party
That should be an awesome feeling. I do wish you all the best in life.
You're welcome! you have your whole life ahead of you_comma_ you are a star.
How come? What do your brothers do to annoy you?
I hope they don't do it on purpose to annoy you!
That is terrible. Did the police find them?
I hate that people do things like that.
I love eating at casino's. They have some of the best food.
Did you win anything?
Yeah it happens my little bro drives me crazy sometimes
Same here how old is your little bro?
Wow I am so sorry to hear that_comma_ my grandmother passed from cancer about 10 years ago
I get that_comma_ I will pray for her_comma_ best of luck friend
That is nice. You must have a nice body and I am glad that you feel better about yourself.
True_comma_ if one is not happy about something the best thing is to switch things up.
Sorry to hear that RIP
Do you have any other pets
That is awesome! What all do you have going on?
That is great_comma_ you are very lucky and blessed!
Wow_comma_ what are you going to do?
I would maybe hit him or get revenge at least
Was she upset!
What will you get her?
What sport is that?  Sorry but I don't know anything about it.
Ok_comma_ sorry I didn't know.  I hope the play better next time!
Oh my gosh. I am not surprised they denied any wrong doing. I think that is typical of mechanics. What do you plan to do about it?
I think bad reviews are important though. A lot of people use those to determine where they go for service. You may save someone else the trouble you have.
That sounds great!  Have you not seen them in a while?
It will be good to catch up with them!  Family is all that matters.
I'm looking forward to it too! I remember playing Smash on the N64. I loved it.
Sweet. I hope to meet you on the battlefield someday!
You sound excited? do you do it up big?
What are you going to do this year?
That's an interesting theme.  Are you going to make the costumes your self?
That sounds like lots of fun!  
What do you hunt?
I didnt even know there was a dove season. I actually never even went camping before
I want to some day.
that is good_comma_ I am glad you can trust him like that!
That is awesome_comma_ I am glad you have that type of relationship!
Wow_comma_ that is great!  You must have been very excited and grateful!
I hope you enjoy your card very much!
Congratulations! It always warms my heart to hear about a happy loyal companionship.
Well_comma_ it has been for three years so that's a great sign!
I can't say I'm a huge fan of fried chicken. Did you enjoy it at least?
Ew that's gross! Can't you get sick from partially cooked chicken?
Oh wow_comma_ that must have been lovely. How was it living in paradise?
Well I hope for you that one day you can. Maybe retirement! Man_comma_ that would be amazing.
I could not agree more with you. but it seems like a lot of politicians either don't care or are not putting enough resources into combating climate change.
If all people do is pray_comma_ then certainly nothing will change. It's time to start acting instead of wishing for things to change if we want to our children and grandchildren to see a future.
Aww that is sweet are you going?
Aww well do what you think is best
Well I would go on the date then buy the kid a big present.
Awww. I remember that feeling with my first kid
it is. just wait until he says "dada" you will melt lol
What movie do you plan to watch?
Oh I've seen that_comma_ it is not too bad! I had fun watching it.
I used to love them. I cant believe that are still performing
I thought they were so much better that nsync too lol
i hate when someone does that_comma_ it can be so annoying :)
no need to go that far_comma_ just make sure your friend has not seen the movie before and go out and enjoy it.
what did you do?
that is true_comma_ that is lame though
Its always good to have solid family members.  Not everyone has that.
That's good to hear.  
I bet you hate having to leave and I am sure she misses you.
You must be proud of her. That is great.
She must have a lot of faith in you.
Ouch! I hope he was okay!
Are your not liking your new job?
That's no good. What are you going to do?
I am sorry you are feeling lonely.   Why don't you see your friends much anymore_comma_ are you all to busy>
Yes I know what you mean_comma_  That has happened to me too.
Wow what kind of toys did you find
THe nostalgia must have been so good!
Nice! Would you like to send the cleaning fairy round to my place?!
What a wonderful daughter you have. She has a very good heart. You've obviously been an excellent parent!
Definitely both of you :) Maybe go to an ice cream parlor or a spa?
Or even do both! Is your daughter in school?
Oh wow_comma_ that must be exciting! Is this your first home?
I hope you do_comma_ too. I will definitely throw in a prayer or two that you do!
Does it still work?
Nice. I love finding old stuff from my childhood.
That's pretty rude.  Are you going to buy him some more beer.
Man.. I'm glad you're not my roommate.
Wow did anyone see?
Dang_comma_ it must have been embarrassing 
You are exactly like me. Those were the good old days
My youngests are 3 and 4 now. Those days are gone
That sounds exciting!_comma_ are you nervous?
That is true_comma_  but you will meet new people and learn a lot!
Congratulations!! How did it feel when you found out?
How cool! Congrats again on your new addition_comma_ I'll keep you in my thoughts and pray you get some sleep in the next 12 months haha
That is great news!  You must be really proud of him!
That is good positive reinforcement!  Congrats to your kid!
Okay_comma_ I am sorry that it was not up to your standard. I have not seen it as yet.
Okay_comma_ I understand. I am thinking of watching it.
Oh no. How long was the power out for?
That sounds awful!
How does that make you feel
Well I wish you the best of luck.  If you're hardworking then you'll make it
Oh cool!  I bet it's also nice not having a boss breathing down your neck_comma_ right?
I have been in the past.  Right now I'm part time with some work at home/stuff.  So yeah I do remember liking not having a boss the most!
Well_comma_ that's a good present! I'm sure you are excited to get it.
That's right_comma_ you do. I have a hard time doing that myself and should realize I deserve it as well too.
That sounds horrible!  Good thing you are all right and only walked away with a little shame!
That's good.  It could have been a lot worse!
I would be too haha...whos fault was it
How old is your kid
That's cool that you're active.  Does she go to college or what
Gotcha.  I make sure to call my mom at least twice a week_comma_ I'm 26 and I've got my own apartment as well
That's really awesome_comma_ I'm happy for your success and encourage you to enjoy yourself.
So far so good_comma_ just trying to stay cool. Good conversations are helping.
That is wonderful news. That is a lot of money to win. I am happy for you.
Oh yes_comma_ you can relax a bit and pay some bills.
Amazing. Those things seem to never pay out. That is a lot.
I know that feeling. Did you treat yourself after winning?
I'm a Boston boy but I gotta give em props
People hate on Brady cuz he's been gold since day 1.  But the Eagles came ready on defense that's for sure
That is good_comma_ that is what we hit the gym for right?
I do_comma_ I have been trying to bulkup_comma_ I am 6'4 190 and need some more on my frame
That could be awkward. I wonder what made him feel he could do that?
Hopefully he got the point and wont ask again.
I am happy that you reached home safely. You have to be very careful when traveling at nights.
We are living in a cruel world_comma_ I am just happy that you are fine.
I know the feeling_comma_ my little nephew used to beat me at Mortal Kombat constantly just by button smashing. How did your little brother get so good at Wii?
Ahhh! Well at least you found out it was just user error and not that he was actually better than you!
Nothing wrong with being emotional. It's healthy. I get a bit emotional about that stuff too. Family and friends are extremely important.
If they don't_comma_ that's their loss. My family are so important to me - I love them dearly. The same goes for my close friends. Don't listen to other people - they're the ones missing out!
He must trust you a lot.
I hope you guys have fun
That is nice. we are suppose to trust our spouses.
I know one has to earn trust.
That is a lot of kids_comma_ imagine raising that many kids!
wow_comma_ that is huge_comma_ they must have abosrbed kids from another duck or something
I am so very sorry for your loss.  I lost my mom last year.
It is a very long process_comma_ but it is true that time does help a tiny bit.
OH no. Were you still at subway?
I know the feeling. Its hard to work when you are hungry.
I bet you were embarassed
What happened? You had too many bills to pay.
Haha. well at least you treated yourself now you are broke.
Yes you will be looking cute and get a lot of attention
Now you're talking. That would be nice ;)
What is wake-board. That sounds a bit scary.
 I bet it is_comma_ i am afraid of water_comma_ I cannot swim so i know for a fact I would not be trying that. I hope you have fun.
That no good!  How long will he be gone?
Just hold on a little longer!  You will feel better when he gets back!
That's great. Hopefully they eat a lot of food!
I am sure they will have a great time
You must be very proud of yourself. I am proud of you. You are a star.
So you really surprised yourself. I guess you studied hard.
Sometimes it just takes a time and you need to stay proactive. I know it can be disappointing. 
Just keep a budget and stay strict. It will gradually get better.
I think I have seen that movie
I like animated movies. I have lots of kids lol
Do you miss your family
Nice I'm in TX and my fam's in MN.  I try to visit them at least once a year
Oh how exciting! How did she do?
Amazing_comma_ you must feel really proud!
Congrats! How exciting!
Good luck! I am sure it will be fine.
Ohh man_comma_ I am so sorry.  I have had that happen to me many times over the last five years.  Did you contact your landlord?
It is wonderful that you have family that can help.  Are you going to be OK going forward?
That was really nice of you!  You must have a really caring heart!
That cat will love you forever!
I have never been on a roller coaster. I would be very scared too.
Hahaha you are going to scream_comma_ I hope you dont puke. It should be fun though.
Awww that is so sweet. Did he go to a good home?
That is good to hear. I hope he lives a good life.
How are you feeling about it?  Are you sad?
I am sorry about it_comma_ did she move close by or to another town?
I bet you will be balling. I hope you remember the poorer folks like me.
That sounds grand :) it's a deal I am rooting for you.
And what movie did you guys see
Wow that must have been a while back...do you still keep in touch with these friends
Good luck! I am sure that it will go well.
I hope you find out soon.
Oh my gosh.  I am so sorry.  What happened?
Oh no.  Poor thing!  Hope you are hanging in there.
That is good_comma_ reading always relaxes me too.
Yes_comma_ curling up in bed with those things can relax you like nothing else!
That is exciting!   How long will it take before they give you and answer?
I hope everything goes great and you get your new home!
Ah a Patriots fan. Sorry about that_comma_ but they've been so great in the past_comma_ you should feel pride in that.
He really is a talented player_comma_ I must admit.
How was that experience for you
You must have been proud.  But she wouldn't be there if you didn't persistently push her to do her best
I am glad to hear that. It can take a lot for some people to be confident like that. I am glad you got over your issues with it.
Yeah_comma_ I know exactly what you mean. 
I've had that happen before.  Its like they are trying to become professionals at it. Was it a whopper?
I think they would lie sooner if they could.  My kid told me flat out that her brother did something when it was impossible that he could've so I knew instantly.  Its humorous while they're young watching them get into such a deep hole.
Are you going to have a surprise party?
I know that is hard_comma_ but it's alright if you do it for the right reasons.  You all will be able to laugh about it when it's all over.  Have fun!
Oh geez_comma_ I know how that is. How long do you think it had been that way?
That's pretty interesting. Well_comma_ I hope you get that all sorted out!
Wow_comma_ good for you finding the courage to overcome your fear! I can understand why you were nervous after what you went through.
I completely understand. Your parents sound like great people.
That is great.  Do you still swim?
Well you can start slowly_comma_ I'm sure you will find your motivation again
That is so exciting! I love babies. Do you know what his name will be?
Thats a neat way to decide on a name. We picked our kids names months in advance. Luckily their names fit them well. 
Soooo how was it?
Oh no haha. I'm guessing you at least had to be polite and pretend like you didn't want to puke?
Crazy_comma_ was it like the movies?
Reminds me of that Eddie Murphy movie!
Lmao sounds like a confident dude
Or he's looking for his soulmate
I hear you.  I still love the McNuggets_comma_ but I never eat them since I went Vegan.
It's the best_comma_  but it is hard to give up the delicious fried meats_comma_ though.  
Oh my goodness!  What happened?!
I bet you and your date were shaken up!
Did you crash!?
I am so sorry that happened to you! 
That stinks.  I always feel left out when that happens to me.  Even more so when I know the people from my best friend's work so when I can't be involved_comma_ its hard.  How do you feel about it?
I'm sorry.  Make sure to reach out to her and tell her how you feel.  If she's a good friend_comma_ she'll understand and make an effort to make time for you but don't let it make you bitter.
How terrifying!  Did the intruder took anything or was he just some kind of creep?
That is so awful.  I imagine you won't feel safe again until you get the alarm.  You can also get a big dog to help you keep safe.
Oh man_comma_ that would have freaked me out what did you do?
It seems your daughter may over exaggerate things a little bit.
Why did you do it?  Do you now feel bad about it?
Well maybe you can tell your friend and ask him/her to forgive you.
Well if you trained as hard as you stated_comma_ I am sure you will do great!
Sounds like a great plan. Good luck!
That's whats up!
Keep it up. Failure is for dweebs.
Ouch_comma_ that sounds so painful!  No I have never have them.  Do you know you can avoid them in the future?
That is great that your wife took such great care of you!   I hope you are now feeling completely recovered.
Oh_comma_ really?  Was something wrong?  
I can understand your feelings; but I suspect you made the right decision.  Maybe it is something you can talk with your friend about.  A good friend will understand.
Oh no! Did you find out who?
You should look for camera in the area_comma_ they could help you catch the perp.
What are you getting certified for?  It seem that you were weel prepared.
That is great.  I wish you the best of luck!
That's cool.  Was he better than Cris Angel
What kind of tricks did he do
Congratulations! It takes a lot of courage to move away from home like that.
It's great that you're so positive about life.
Oh you are such a great wife! I think he will totally appreciate it! Are you doing anything nice for him?
Oh_comma_ sounds very romantic! Have fun my friend!
Oh no. Are you scared at all?
Well if you do decide to go through with it_comma_ I wish you the best and quick healing!
Oh my_comma_ what did you have surgery for?
That's really nice! I hope you recover really quick!
Great! I'm sure you've prepared a lot for it. Good luck!
I'm sure you'll do well.
Oh how exciting! I love the beach! Are you bringing lots of snacks and drinks?
Oh yes don't forget the sun block. Very important! Well I hope you all have fun out there! I am jealous!
They must have tasted good!
Lesson learned_comma_ that's for sure
Guess you're just going to have to evacuate or something!
Better not go on any planes!
Oh no! I hate when things like that happen. You can sometimes still get it if you try to speak to the manager
Yea...sometimes gym managers tend not to be there which is a pain. I hope it works out for you_comma_ though!
You must feel awful about it!  What are you going to do?  Are you telling your friend?
Yes I believe it is better.  I hope your friend understand.
That sounds sad.  What are you getting distracted from?
Well_comma_ that sounds admirable.  Focusing on making money so you can be independent.  
Try me
haha oh man did the owner get mad...or did he just laugh it off
That is awesome. What changed?
Can fat really turn into muscles? Asking for myself? lol 
I rented a Corolla once.  It had great responsiveness_comma_ was speeding like a mofo 
I'm more of a Honda guy tbh.  My Civic lasted me a 21hr nonstop drive from MN to South TX and she still runs good as new
Gross!  That must have been disgusting!
That is true!  way to look at the bright side!
How scary!   Thank god nothing bad happened after all. 
That is the important thing_comma_  I always keep reminding myself to focus while driving too.
True_comma_ you must be feeling nostalgic_comma_ kids going back to school and all
Someone needs to invent a time machine!
that is awesome. i too have had the same issues.
i wouldn't eat until 11 am and then stop eating by 9pm
it's not as hard as i thought it would be. certainly helps with staying within a certain amount of calories per daay.
Aww_comma_ why's that? Do you live in an older home>?
Hey_comma_ don't worry about what other people think! As long as you have a safe roof over your head and your family is happy_comma_ that's all that matters!
Oh no.  Did they do damage or steal anything?
That is definitely scary.  I don't understand why people want to steal from others.  Get a dang job!
Was that for work?
I'm sure you are going to do great.  I really hope you do get a better paying job as a result.  Good luck!
Oh that sucks! How far do you live from the venue?
Sorry you missed the concert. That is a bummer! But it came with some perks I guess. You met a girl!
What a nice story and how wonderful to feel so protected!
Yes I am sure that have make you or will make you in the future a wonderful parent too!
Oh no! I hope that you get well soon and that the tests come back okay!
Me too! I'm not sure what you might be going through but do consider making sure youre eating a good amount of fruits and veggies. Herbs too_comma_ they're all healing and helpful to the body.
Good to hear_comma_ coffee is the bomb!
So much winning_comma_ but with coffee it never gets old
Did she forgive you?
That must've been funny
Jeeze_comma_ I hope he really had to go_comma_ otherwise he must have been slacking off on purpose!
Well that's good_comma_ at least he didn't do it on purpose. Otherwise I would have found a way to get back at him. Maybe laxatives to make him REALLY go!
Oh_comma_ congratulations! That's awesome. When's the wedding?
I can imagine. Now you have to get planning the wedding. Should be fun
That was very careless of him_comma_ I'm sorry.
Maybe you should talk with him and let him know how serious of an issue it is to you.
Sorry to hear that_comma_ I'm glad you were prepared.
You did the right thing. You should always stay ready for a disaster.
Cool_comma_ what did you study?
Nice_comma_ I bet you can't wait to graduate.
Those are such high payments_comma_ be sure to get your plan based on your income_comma_ it really helps.
Yes_comma_ the US takes advantage of the need for education. I hope you find a job you love_comma_ and don't forget that they have lots of payment options.
Oh that sounds mean.  How did you do?
Are you two still going out?
Well_comma_ that was terrible of you. Why would you do that?
Wow.... I certainly hope so.
Ouch_comma_ I've done that before. But how sweet of him_comma_ sounds like a keeper.
Ah_comma_ so he had ulterior motives and wanted the chores done! Just kidding. Glad you're feeling better.
Oh no! Did they help you find another home/let you stay with them for a while?
That is so great! Its good to know that there are still good people in this world
I love those. That must have brought up some nice memories.
Oh I see. Are you far from home?
Congrats! Did he choose wisely?
Well_comma_ you did say it was one you really wanted. How nice of him to do that for you.
Oh_comma_ that must be heartbreaking for you. Do you know where he is?
That would be the best birthday present ever! I know he'll make every effort possible to be with you.
I am so sorry to hear that. That kind of news is always hard to receive.
They have all kinds of treatments for cancer now. He should have a fighting chance.
Sorry to hear that. What happened to him?
Oh that is a nice surprise. I bet you caught up with each other.
Jeez_comma_ wonder why they left it there for that long?
Who knows_comma_ that's a waste of a good sandwich though!
That must make you angry. Can you report him?
I understand. Hopefully he fixes it for you.
No way!! Are you ok?
Did they take anything valuable?
Every found out why they didn't show up?
Well that's understandable. Hope you had a great party afterwards!
That must be amazing! I wish I had your job
It would make me feel amazing to see their face!
Oh that is cool! I bet you are proud.
It is paying off. That is such a fun age.
Oh no. That sounds annoying. Know what's causing it?
Hopefully you have insurance?
That's unfortunate. A hit and run is terrible
I hope things look better. My friend dealt with a similar issue
That's unfortuante. I bet he is good now
What university or college?
Oh how exciting! Are you at all worried how they'll take being separated?
Definitely. It will probably be tougher on you than him. Here's to a wonderful first day of preschool for both of you!
I am so sorry. That is horrible. Now what?
That must be so difficult. I hope all turns out well.
Awesome. That is a huge accomplishment.
You must be very proud. Cant wait to see what he does next.
Wow! That is amazing
I have never had that happen to me
That's disgusting! Hopefully you got a refund or your food recooked?
Good_comma_ I bet you were mad. At least they made it right though.
Well hopefully you will see them again soon. I'm sure they will.
You must find joy in your life - something you are passionate about
You must be anxious and excited! Was it expected?
Hope everything goes as planned!
That is so sad. Did you find out who did it?
I feel so sorry for you. I love my pets too.
How exciting! What kind of car is it?
Oh sounds nice. Hopefully he doesn't have any accidents in it.
Where will the show be?
that sounds amazing! check out the french quarter while you are there.
I love the weather that time of the year. I agree_comma_ it is so much fun.
That is awesome. I love all the food and time off.
You sound like a great uncle!  You must be proud of him!
That is great that you are there to help him out!
i hate to ask why you walked back out
gross_comma_ i don't blame you_comma_ public restrooms are always disgusting
Ooh fun! Has it been long since the last time you saw them?
That will be nice to have some time to catch up. Have fun!
Yes_comma_ I love big trips. I spend hours packing!
That's debatable!
That's awesome! Congratulations.
That's great. You have quite the household it seems!
That's unfortunate. Sometimes used cars can be tough to deal with
I hope not. I have a feeling things will get better
Oh no! I have had that happen to me before_comma_ too.
Good_comma_ I would have too!
I'm sure you'll do great! Have you been preparing?
Good luck! don't be nervous. I'm sure you'll knock it out of the park!
Congratulations!  That's awful!  DO they not have kids themselves?  Its a pretty typical thing to happen when you're the first to have a baby among them and they don't understand that lifestyle. I've been there.
I'm so sorry. My sister was in the very same situation as you and I can tell you_comma_ she made it through and her daughter is 9 now.  She kept taking a day at a time and working hard and went back to school to become a nurse. You can do it to. Find some true friends who will support you no matter what. 
I am so sorry to hear this. I am sure you will find another job_comma_ but it doesn't make it any less painful.
Just have faith_comma_ I am sure it will all turn out!
That's sounds like a lovely night. I bet it was wonderful
I love the guitar_comma_ too! That's marvelous
Oh my goodness. I'm so sorry to hear that.
How old was your friend?
Wow_comma_  you are so caring
Ohhh_comma_  so how is she now? 
That's exciting! I wish you the best of luck!
It's already yours_comma_ hopefully! If not_comma_ that means there's something out there better for you.:)
I'm so sorry! You must've been so sad. Did you find out who did it?
Oh thank goodness! I hate hearing people losing their pets.
That's awesome. Where to?
I hope you have a splendid time! That might be great
That is bittersweet! What is his name?
That is a unique name_comma_ I have 3 sons myself.
I would have been scared_comma_ too! Was it by fault or was someone attempting to break in?
Mine did that_comma_ too. We had to replace the motion sensor.
thats great! what is llws?
that's great! my kids played baseball
How exciting! What is it?
Omg! That really is the best birthday present ever!
That must have been really exciting.  Did you think you had lost it?
Were you really close to her?
That's unfortunate. You will get the next one_comma_ I am sure.
I bet your employer still knows how much you have put in
That sounds fun! Has it been a while since you seen your family?
I am glad you are getting to see them!
Are you a nurse?
That is awesome! My sister is a CNA now but in school to become a nurse. Have you worked in any other settings as a nurse?
A new mom? Good question_comma_ maybe offer to mow their lawn? I don't really know haha
Welcome_comma_ and yeah I always disliked mowing the lawn!
I'm glad. You seem very happy
I'm glad you have a great family!
Ah that is depressing! What state?
Wow that is a long move!
I bet it gets lonely
Yes there are. Can't trust anyone these days.
What is so great?
Around town? or what?
Was his name Joe Dirt?
I think I heard about them in the news.
I'm so sorry. I recently just lost both of my grandparents within a year. I know how you feel.
It really is. Getting older is not fun.
Oh my gosh! Me too. It literally makes my skin crawl. 
I agree. I avoid going to stores during busy times because I just cant handle being around so many people.
Oh no! Spaghetti sauce is so tough to get out
Lol i am sorry about that! hopefully you can get it out
Me too. It is a huge pet peeve of mine.
Right? Get out of the way!
Was you way down yonder on the Chattahoochee?
Hmmm... Not as interesting
Oh man I HATE waiting on test results! Gets my anxiety to extreme levels.
Well I'm glad to hear you have a clean bill of health!
Life is not fair for anybody
Yeah_comma_ as long as you have a car you are better than most people
Sheesh that is terrible. I would have a hard time not leaving
Well hopefully something else will come up for you!
That sure do_comma_ how old is your son?
That is so exciting.. enjoy this time with him.
I love eating out at a restaurant with great food! Too bad it's too expensive to go every night!
Yeah_comma_ I enjoy cooking but it can be so time consuming.
I would have shot back_comma_ that is uncalled for
Maybe you should cut his brakes
That sounds really cool.  Is her Blog very popular?
Oh my goodness!  That is so awesome.  I would love to be able to do something like that.
Thats one of my biggest regrets was not investing in it. Now the value has skyrocketed. 
I didnt know that. I guess not.
that is bad how did it happen 
what happened afterwards 
What did he do
Oh my! That is horrible!
Oh wow! I guess he didn't care!
That is the truth_comma_ no shame in his game.
Interesting... what are you going for?
That is awesome_comma_ good luck
I do_comma_ too! I always make my husband kill them.
I don't blame you! Get them all!
That is awesome. I hope he says yes!
Well I wish both of you years of happiness together!
Probably didn't last too long when you got back though I'm guessing
It happens_comma_ I'm sure they don't blame you!
Does that mean what I think it means?  have you had a juicy flatulence experience? 
I wonder if there is anything you can do about that.
Oh my that is horrible_comma_ i hope you find it!
Man there are some crappy people in the world
Did they get caught?
Did they take anything important?
What were the leftovers?
I enjoy fried rice! I hope she wasn't too upset.
Nice_comma_ what did you do with it?
Haha yeah I guess you can't really return it at that point
Any big plans? My son just turned 4. I've been nostalgic also.
That sounds fun! have you been looking at the old baby pictures?
That is a very nice thing to do! I am a big animal lover. 
Me either. It breaks my heart. 
t
I am so glad to hearit. What's going right in your life?
Oh no_comma_ was you able to get pregnant?
Congrats! Are you still pregnant?
What band? That was very thoughtful or her. 
Awesome_comma_ I hope you have a great time at the concert. 
Do you think you have a good shot?
Is the interview soon? Good luck.
Wow_comma_ where did he get it from?
That's awesome_comma_ glad he's able to hand it down to the next generation
Oh man that is so scary. Did they steal anything?
Were you in the house?
That is awesome! I am happy for you!
That is what is most important!
That's funny_comma_ it's like you can see your kids and see yourself experiencing it when you were a kid
Right_comma_ it's hard to imagine there was a time before you when you're little
That sounds nice! I'm sure they appreciate it a lot.
I bet! Good bonding time. How old is your son?
Wow how exciting! what do you do?
If you put forth the effort im sure you will
I'm sorry. Your boss still knows about the great work you have put in_comma_ though
Yes you will! That's a great attitude
Wow that's actually hilarious. And very unfortunate
Wow that's even funnier... But even more unfortunate
Oh_comma_ no. Was it deadly?
That is rough. I am glad you made it through.
Are you nervous? I'm sure you'll do great if you prepared.
Good luck! I'm sure you'll ace it!
I find myself not finishing potatoes either! They take so long to cook
Right_comma_ taste good too
I could only dream of having that. That must be nice.
I wish my company would allow me to do that.
That is faithful_comma_ you are a good dude
That is good_comma_ they are hard to find
Oh_comma_ no! Were you alone?
She must be a party animal.
Fluff that stinks_comma_ did you shoot em?
sheesh what a bummer!
I do not like scary! I try to stay away from scary movies_comma_ too!
It sounds like you had a good time though.
How fast were you going?
Wow_comma_ I got a ticket the other day going 70 in a 55. I was late for work
Nice_comma_ hope you have fun!!
I'm sure it'll go swimmingly
Why is that?
Who is your team.
That is good. what is going on with it?
That is good_comma_ i hope it stays that way
Ive been wanting a jeep for myself too! They are so cool
I agree! They look cool and are fun to play in the mud with
Nice_comma_ must have been shopping with his wife.
Macho man lol 
That's funny_comma_ likes it's an extension as who they are as a person
I see_comma_ yeah sometimes you just gotta lead by example
Man that was super lucky_comma_ most people would have taken it
Exactly_comma_ it doesnt happen very often 
Really? I dont watch much football
I like soccer
that was very nice of them. you werent able to walk into an office and get it faster
oh then that makes sense. good thing they were willing to help
Wow. Twins. How rare is it to have them?
Man. Thats very interesting. Were you at all surprised to have twins then?
I've never tried that_comma_ do you bet money on it?
Nice_comma_ hope it goes well
Slammed as in he got really drunk_comma_ or slammed as in he got into a fight?
Its been a while since I've seen someone drunk
that is strange_comma_ i would have got out of there
I would be a little spooked out by being alone
That stinks_comma_ did you go anyway?
Yeah they are_comma_ but so good
That is awesome.  Is it with the same company_comma_ or someone different?
I hope you get it!  When will you find out?
Cool_comma_ what did you do about it?
Little bugger_comma_ maybe next time
Which movie did you see?
I watched parts of it too. I didnt think it was that great either.
what is co-op?
Oh that is really neat! i hope they like it
Did you do or say anything?
Sometimes you got to setp in and say something though when you know something is not right.
Were you legit sick?
Lol that happens to the best of us_comma_ dont feel bad
Wow that is impressive. Do you work with him?
That is still not bad!
Nice!  Hope something horrible didn't happen to you just to get it.  You getting a lot?
Wow!  That seems worth it!!!!  Wish it had happened to me! ha ha.  Hope you're healthy still and congratulations!
That is awesome! What breed?
Oh ok that is very nice of you 
That's pretty scary.  Was it like a scene from taken?
That sounds pretty awful. no thanks.
Oh_comma_ that is irritating sometime! That happens to me sometimes
Lol. I am guilty of hiding a couple of snacks for myself at times_comma_ nothing wrong with that
How did that go? 
No way! I can not stand when people do shady things like that. We you able to get your stuff back? Did he get in trouble?
Yeah I would have been mad too. If he needed something he should have at least asked. Stealing is never okay.
Wow that is odd_comma_ is there nothing you can do about it?
That is insane_comma_ i hope everything works out!
That sounds like a win!  Did she get mad?
This just happened?  Oh boy!  maybe you can replace it before she gets up.
That's awesome. I hope you don't spend it all too quickly.
Make sure the consultant doesn't try to rip you off either haha.
I hated chemistry in school_comma_ i hope you do well
It is a difficult subject no doubt
That's a good idea. Hopefully_comma_ you had enough room
That's good news. I bet it was fun!
Mmm_comma_ pizza sounds good. What's keeping you from ordering pizza yourself? Why let him have all the fun?
Go for it! You'll only regret the pizzas you don't eat!
Dang_comma_ traffic must be intense in your area
True_comma_ driving takes more focus than a lot of people can handle
who's birthday is it?
don't worry
Do you feel bad about it?
You should make it up to that person.
Oh I do not like spiders either!  What did you do?
I'd probably have done the exact same thing - then called for my husband or one of my daughters to kill it!!
Oh no!  Were you able to take care of him with medicine or treatments?
I'm so sorry!  I know how hard it is to lose a pet!  I hope you are not sad for too long.  It sounds like you did everything you could to give it a great life. 
That's good to hear_comma_ one of the best advantages you can have in life
And they're all you got in the end!
Whoa_comma_ did you find out what it was?
I dont blame you_comma_ i would have been terrified 
It can be boring to drink at the bar by yourself.
That must be a cool bar to let pets in.
I have a problem getting rid of things too. Sometimes you just have to throw it away_comma_ or donate it.
Just leave the house and have someone trash it for you.
Glad I could help.
Oh no. I am so sorry to hear that. Were you close with this coworker?
Than I completely understand that would be so hard
That would even make it worse. Did it happen all of a sudden?
I am so sorry for the loss. Good friends are so hard to come by
Nice_comma_ it's like little kids can learn anything!
That's awesome_comma_ hope he goes far
Oh gosh! are you ok?
Haha thats a good name. Were you able to see it vividly?
Ouch what a jerk. Why did he do that?
Oh I hope you punched him back.
Oh no! Was you at least at home when that happened?
I bet that was embarrassing. Was you drunk?
Im so sorry_comma_ i can not immagine that
That is terrible
I can agree with that_comma_ adulting sucks
i miss them as well
What do you mean?
Oh they're in your bubble. that stinks_comma_ some people are weird like that_comma_ no bounderies.
I truly do feel bad that you have to endure that. My girlfriend and I were just talking about how horrible she's going to feel when she loses her Havanese pup at some point in the distant future_comma_ since she's so close to her. I hope you can grieve the loss of your great friend in a healthy way.
I can appreciate why they'd say that. They just want you to feel better. But it's all about to how you're feeling. You'll know in your gut when to get another pet_comma_ if you ever want to get another one. It's important to take the time to reflect on your lost relationship.
That's wonderful! You're right_comma_ it is so rewarding to stand back and see everything clean once you are done.
Right_comma_ that's something you can at least have full control over. Your own humble abode.
Was your landlord truly trying their best_comma_ or did they simply not care about your well-being at that time?
I'm so sorry to hear that. Some people are just cruel to others that are not within their social circle.
ugh. People like that are gross.
I know right. Some people are too lazy.
Wow I envy you. That sounds like a wonderful feeling!
Thank you! I hope to feel that content someday!
I didn't think that was possible for a dog on a walk! What kind of dog do you have?
That's quite the mix! What's his name?
Funny you say that... my roommate just got a cat about a month ago. I was hesitant to agree to share the apartment with it_comma_ as I'm not the most fond of them. But I didn't want to say no. It's actually been an affectionate cat so far.
I suppose so. I've never gravitated towards them. They seem like they only have one personality_comma_ and they're either nice or mean_comma_ and never warm up to you over time. So_comma_ I was a little wary of that.
What kind of hobby do you have?
That is awesome!  What kind of boats do you make?
That sounds like an ugly scene...did anybody step in
For real? haha good job!
That is awesome! i am happy for you!
i agree totally_comma_ it takes a strong person to admit they are like that
What kind of trouble is he having right now?
Oh no. That is no good! It is hard to sit back and watch someone have a drug problem
Good job. That can be really tough to go through that.
You are a good friend though. I wish i had more friends like you.
They'll understand_comma_ sometimes it's better not to overextend yourself
Better to rest so you can do everything you want tomorrow!
Yes_comma_ I love it here. It is the greatest country in the world.
That is how I feel about it. I love my country.
Dear lord_comma_ how old are you?
I was joking. I havent a curfew since I was 17. Im an only child so wouldnt know much about favorites.
O no did you report it to the hospital
That is not ok I would make go to a higher up
You want to start school back up?  What are you going for?
I bet that is a lot of work!  Do you already teach?
Oh yes! I know your feeling. I see my dog as a child as well.
Right! It's like some kind of spiritual bond I think. It's a wonderful love to have!
That's touching_comma_ how is it these days?
Right_comma_ change is often difficuly
Yeah I see no harm in that
Yeah i know i dont get why people are that way
That would be great. Good luck.
I really hope you get it. Just stay confident.
Congratulations! I'm so happy to hear that. You must be really excited!
Holy moly ravioli. 27 million? You are rolling in the money.
that isnt good_comma_ were they true?
That is terrible_comma_ is there someone above him you can go to?
Are you going to watch?
No_comma_ I am not a big fan. Which team do you like?
How did he get hurt?
That happened to me a few weeks ago. I was severely dehydrated and I fainted. I hit the ground hard.
I am now. Had to get stitched up.
Oh dang. Do you think it was intentional?
Oh that stinks. I bet you were pretty mad?
Oh no_comma_ what did you buy?
Was it at least Budweiser?
Sorry to hear that. Do you think it was an intruder or just some prankster? 
Did they take your television? 
What stops you from going? Being busy with life_comma_ or just deep down you just do not want to go
Sometimes life does have away with getting away from us
Life is good when its like that
Cherish those moments
I don't blame you_comma_ I would have eaten some. Did they notice?
What type of candy was it? I like Sour Patch and chocolates.
Good taste in candy! I love Reeses cups and Hershey bars. Did you eat any of those?
Where are you going?
What the heck is there?
School can be al ot of work
I say go for it
I'm sure she'll be flattered if you're honest about how you're feeling!
I see_comma_ I hope it goes well for you!
what do you mean i think it is pretty good right now
Yeah it always foes in the end
That is terrible_comma_ i hope everything is ok
I am so sorry to hear that!
That's got to be annoying! Have you tried telling him to stop?
Maybe he should take up knitting--or something else that would be a bit more quiet.
what was it?
Ah that is disgusting!
Same here. Are you living on a street where it is normal_comma_ as far as crime?
Dang that is pretty scary though.
Yeah_comma_ when I was younger I did some of that stuff as well. It's a really embarrassing thing to hear stories about things you did that you don't remember doing.
Well if you have never gotten blind drunk and strip naked_comma_ you haven't lived.
Oooh like what kind of toys?
Wow that sounds like fun.I love canoeing!
You ever think about moving?
Hope everything works out for you!
Aww_comma_ how long have you been together?
That's amazing_comma_ keep up the good work!
Why did you steal stuff?
Oh_comma_ that is rude_comma_ did you pay him back?
Nice! I wish I was more active in searching for scholarships like it sounds like you are. But this one sounds like it was a lot of hard work to earn. I haven't been the smartest about lightening the student loan debt burden while in school. Good on you for looking ahead.
Sometimes compromises have to be made. But I have to say_comma_ I'm impressed that you were that self-aware about the entire process_comma_ especially as a somewhat new adult. Good for you for considering all the options and making the choice you felt was best. You sound like you'll be successful after college_comma_ especially because of how hard-working you are.
Nothing like a deep clean to breathe new life into your home! Its a great idea to get it out of the way now so it won't me on your mind once things start to get busy. 
I completely understand that. Its a good quality to have and is actually healthier in the long run if you keep your surroundings clean.
Someone broke in?
Good thinking.  Sounds like you should get yourself a new house
I agree_comma_ such helicopter parents exercise far too much control on their kids_comma_ doing more harm than good in the long run.
I completely agree. Unfortunately we also have to clean up the mess made by our parent generation.. you know like climate change exists! 
What kind of belt does he have?
Heh. Thats really cool. I need to take self defense classes.
Oh man i am jealous. Are you going with anyone?
Dang are you scared at all? As far as doing it yourself?
Did you tell him he ate it in his sleep
I hope it tasted good!
Why are you having to go again?
Probably from the crazy weather change. I hope they figure out what is causing the cough
Oh no. Well I hope that makes him better
I am sure he will be fine
I am happy for you. Just keep going
That is a good thing ha
That's great.  I don't have any tattoos myself_comma_ but a lot of people I know do.  And it seems expensive.  So I'm glad he's not charging you much. 
It seems that a decent one is several hundred dollars.  I just don't have that kind of money.
I hope so_comma_ too. Heart conditions can be scary! Do you have anyone closer to her that could check in?
I know quite a few people that live their lives that way. I can see some of the reasons why a person would think that -- but it's still difficult when it comes to the health of someone you love.
What is deserved or undeserved? 
I see_comma_ dont worry though. Nowadays everyone finds an excuse to grab their pitchfork and point it at someone.   
That's good timing at least. Glad it didn't take too long.
What ended up being the problem ?
She sounds like a great girl. I am sure it will you sound like a happy couple.
Hell yea you sound like a genuine guy/girl. You know what is important_comma_ you will do fine.
Why would your uncle be upset? And how do you feel about the situation? It sounds like there's a lot to unpack there.
I see. Well_comma_ what's most important is your reaction and feelings around the situation_comma_ and what you plan to do about it. The only one that can affect the outcome is you. It's disappointing to deal with your uncle's negativity_comma_ but you can't let it distract you from moving in a positive direction.
That's great when life just feels right
I hope they do too! I'm happy for you
You must be feeling nostalgic_comma_ maybe your kids will enjoy them
Right_comma_ it's amazing how one thing can bring back so many memories
Wow_comma_ that was super nice of him. You are lucky to have such a great dad.
That is a really great thing to hear. I hope you can find some way to pay back his kindness.
yeah but that is his ob
yeah im not sure i could every take that job
That sounds like an uncomfortable situation. What ended up happening? I kind of avoid large crowds and sports events because of this_comma_ since there's usually alcohol involved.
Oh_comma_ so you got involved? Were you trying to protect the kid? If so_comma_ I can understand that_comma_ and that's noble. Hopefully nothing too negative came from the situation.
Yikes_comma_ that's very disrespectful. I hope you told him how you feel about that.
That's good_comma_ at least he learned from that. I hope you guys are going strong now!
Did your boyfriend notice?
Lol. Sometimes we got to do what we gotta do
Did he! You lucky dog!
Well dang that is awesome man_comma_ hopefully you can save up for your own lambo.
Were you actually under the influence?
Well that's great of her_comma_ we've all done stuff.
That sucks_comma_ I'm sorry to hear it. Did they at least ask you first?
At least they asked you_comma_ that's good. It will pass in no time and you'll be hanging soon I'm sure_comma_
Dang_comma_ I guess she wasn't your friend after all
It is_comma_ glad you could figure out that she's not right to have in your life
Oh no_comma_ did you get into trouble with your boss?
Ahh_comma_ that's too bad. Just make sure to take responsibility and be very sorry for your actions_comma_ maybe it won't be so bad.
I get that_comma_ nothing can beat home!
I am sorry to hear that_comma_ well maybe when you retire!
A good dentist is great to have!
Did you have a lot of work done?
what were the left overs?
That sounds good!
Sounds like quite the adventure you had. You must feel proud of yourself. 
Yes and hopefully no one was hurt. 
Nice you must feel pretty lucky
Haha I wouldn't either if I had a Porsche....sounds like you need some kind of bomb shelter emergency parking
Are you happy with it
I am glad for you then
A couch! how was it hurting you?
Haha no worries. I though how could a couch could be scary... Are you OK? did you go to the doctor?
Oh_comma_ no! It happens to the best of us.
Luckily it is in the past_comma_ and I am sure no one remembers it!
That's good to hear! What makes him so awesome?
I'm happy he's able to support his family through his work. I hope he enjoys it!
Gross!  I would have been super mad if my cat did that!  What did you do?
Yeah_comma_ I would have done the some.  Hopefully that never happens to you again.
Oh no_comma_ maybe try going to reddit and ask people what to do in your city!
Hahaha_comma_ me too_comma_ it's such a time sink. This week when it was down for a couple hours I really felt like I had nothing else to browse.
Uh oh! How was it driving weird?
Yikes! My old Ford Focus had a similar issue. It turned out to be really bad alignment and ended up putting a hole in our front tire. 
Oh yeah?  You applying to a new job?  
Oh how cool!  Well good luck my friend!!! What do you want to study?
What does it not do right?
That's so lame_comma_ you should maybe tell your boss about it though.
Oh wow_comma_ that isn't good.  Hopefully you had good insurance and that you are ok!
Is the kid ok?  He won't have his license for a few more years probably now.
So exciting! Do you have any special gift in mind for them? 
Thats alright. As long as you two are happy with each other_comma_ thats the most important thing!
I hope you don't feel jealous of your friend. Did he accept the job?
Seems like you have a trustworthy friend for life! I hope you cherish this friendship.
Don't you just hate that?!
Just remember_comma_ it is probably a female mosquito.  They are the ones interested in your blood.  Not the males.  
Sorry to hear that but why did you distance yourself from your friends?
Good job for realizing that because such people are a bad influence. Join some outdoor or interest clubs and you might just find new friends. 
Oh no! Are you ok?
Yea i would be too! That is a horrible person.
Aww i'm sorry. Maybe enjoy a glass of wine and watch some girly shows. My husband is in the military and gone a lot so I feel for you.
Aww thank you_comma_ means a lot! 
I think if it's done without care then yes_comma_ care for what she would feel that is. Maybe you just have to tell the truth about what you're feeling_comma_ but it's up to you!
Right_comma_ but deep down I'm sure you know that you don't need a relationship to feel content!
That was very nice of him. 
Wow_comma_ that is a wonderful keepsake from him. I bet you really cherish it.
That's nice. Was it a special occasion or anything ?
What did you have to eat ?
What kind of memories
Those were good years for sure
Oh wow_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that! loss can be hard :(
I'm sorry! Take the time to grieve and be there for your friend.
Congrats! that sounds like a good movie!
I saw it_comma_ and it was a good  movie_comma_ i dont usually watch marvel films
Sorry to hear that. You must be going through a tough time. 
You should try engaging in a hobby to divert your mind_comma_ and when you're ready_comma_ adopt a puppy from your local shelter. 
Hey_comma_ congratulations. That must have been a lot of hard work. I wish I put more time into extracurricular stuff like that. It's a good look in the future. Especially the debate team--you develop so many good life skills with that!
I bet... that's a lot of weekends and late evenings practicing and honing your skills. I'm sure it's a lot of positive intangibles developed that you will reap the awards from later on in life.
Glad to hear it! Health is such an important thing_comma_ and the more you look after your body_comma_ the better it will treat you. 
I agree_comma_ now you will financially and physically secure. All the stress of not having insurance is far too much given our healthcare costs.
Uh oh! Are you going to ask him to pay for it? Or at least fix it?
Might be time to just stop letting him use your stuff_comma_ unfortunately.
That is strange. Did you like the gift?
That is for sure! Someone must really like you!
Oh my_comma_ sorry to hear that. How is he holding up?
I am sure it is. Just need to give him time and support right now. 
What are those? Your grades?
Math was always my least favorite. Are you British?
Did you find out why he was fleeing the draft?
That's a bit much of him to dodge his country when they needed him don't you think?
That is awesome! I bet you are so proud
That should motivate him to keep up the good work!
Were you playing in a team?
I understand
I'm glad you're taking it seriously_comma_ parents have the ability to be the best thing that ever happened to their kids' lives_comma_ or the worst_comma_ but I'm sure you're doing your best
Hope you're enjoying it!
That's great! What percentage are you thinking you'll be getting?
That's really good then. I'm sure it will help you financially
How'd it end up after the fact ?
I hope it all went well for you.
That's always fun_comma_ to see those random memories crop up when you least expect. What kind of board games were they?
I've played Monopoly before_comma_ of course. I wonder why that's the game everyone's played during their childhood... But yeah_comma_ Risk I've never played_comma_ dunno why. Maybe you should grab one and get some friends or family involved_comma_ for old time's sake.
That is funny i feel like someone should have said something though
That is great well know you know what not to do on a plane lol
How long have you had it?
Is this recent. Do you know why?
Wow that's lucky.
oh i cot ya. i am glad you have your stuff.
Which Six Flags did you go to?
I live right by that one!
Nice_comma_ such relics of the past really hit you with a wave of nostalgia. Did the gear still fit you?
Oh I see_comma_ that is to be expected. At least you still have the gear!
Oh nice_comma_ how did it go?
Thats great! Glad it worked out for you and your dog was safe! I hear so many bad stories about people loosing pets.
Haha I bet it wasn't that bad....was it
OK now I'm curious...what the hell did you do
You must feel so content at this point. It must have taken a lot of hard work to get to this point!
I am glad that it is finally paying off! Keep it up because independence is the sweetest thing. 
That is unfortunate_comma_ is it possible to go through chemotherapy again?
I hope everything works out for you 
That is so sad. Dogs become part of the family so when something like that happens it is like losing a family member
I am so sorry for your loss_comma_ within time you will heal. Just try to cherish the memories that you was left with_comma_ Think about all the good times
Yeah_comma_ I have a doughter as well and understand.  I guess kids will be kids!
The things they do make no sense.  Kid logic!
Uh oh_comma_ do you think you were being rowdy?
It's Ok. Everyone can chang ein life. Do you drink too much?
Oh my_comma_ sounds like you have the dreaded roommate situation on your hands. Have you tried talking to him? 
I see_comma_ if you're in college_comma_ try talking to your Resident Advisor about it. 
That will be nice. Are you going to have some free time?
You could get a nice dinner with that. Have fun.
Is the car terribly damaged?
I hope it will be ok. Were you late for your work?
That sucks_comma_ it takes so long for them to arrive!
Hope everything works out for you!
I feel that_comma_ even though I prefer Winter
I get that_comma_ but all seasons are good_comma_ you miss the ones that it is not
Is that a game ?
No_comma_ I'm sure I'm a bit older than you.
you can train and get better
i thin yyouca you just have to believe in yursef
Why is that?
I get that_comma_ too bad we cannot refund movies
Nice! You must be so proud of him to achieve such a milestone! 
He must be for his children to seem him as an inspiration! 
Oh god! Is everyone you care about OK?
Man_comma_ i am so sorry_comma_ i could not imagine.
Do you find value in them still?
I think you should keep them instead of throwing them away.
How did he get it?
I hope it wasn't too painful for him and he disinfected and bandaged that wound up.
Oh my god! Are you ok? was anyone home? Did they take anything important?
That's weird. I am happy you have your possesions.
Who is it? 
I bet she is! I am so glad you get to see her. Mom's are awesome!
Was the fire set by someone or an accident?
That's horrible_comma_ i am sorry!
That is good.  It is nice to focus on the positives
I am glad to hear that.  I hope it keeps staying that way
Ugh teenagers can be so troublesome some times! I hope you made him realize what he did was wrong. 
Yup_comma_ but what I don't like about that age is having to stay up all night!
Helping animals sometimes brings great pleasure. You did a good deed
Awe. Ya it doesn't take much to get attached to something that you are nursing back to health
That sounds like a cool place to go! Can you bring your cat there?
That is so cool! We adopted a cat from a shelter and he is the best cat!
Nice! You must be so proud! How old is he?
What an angel! I'm looking forward to starting my own family too.
What did they do?
Ewww. Adults should know better than that. I think I would have been grossed out
That's wonderful! I bet it was a nice trip down memory lane.
Memories are the most precious thing we can have in life I think.
Wow that's been a long time. Did you two have a good time together?
That's great that you two reconnected like it! I'm happy for you.
What did you do?
It is ok. Most spider are not dangerous. What is it a big one?
What did your friends do?
On no. Was this at a public place?
Oh no_comma_ when can you take it again?
Dang that is unfortunate!
Hey that's great!  How long has it been?
Dang.  I bet you're gonna have some good times together!
Whats going to happen?
Oh gosh_comma_ i think it was just a tree falling i bet.
Oh I hope you get it! It can really help out or just be a splurge 
Definitely_comma_ it's good to work for a company that does that too
a 'B'? Hmm_comma_ well you know how it is_comma_ hope your stomach feels better!
You'll be fine_comma_ next time just look and see how clean their bathrooms are_comma_ it gives you a good idea how their kitchens are!
That's wonderful. I also love the holidays. It's the perfect time for families.
Sounds like heaven! I am also looking forward to them too.
That's awesome. You must be so proud of him.
The LSAT is no joke. He must have studied very hard.
What kind of cupcake do you like from there?
Those are so tasty_comma_ are you excited?
Awesome! I hope you do well! When do you take it?
You will do great_comma_ just stay confident!
Communication is key_comma_ have you talked to him about it?
Age doesn't amtter_comma_ show him you are ready.
Oh no_comma_ next time you should bring a friend to be safe.
It's okay_comma_ you got out fine this time!
What does he normally talk about?
Oh yeah_comma_ that really is a waste of time
Nice!  Did you have a good time?
Thats good.  Stay confident and let things happen naturally!
Gratz. What's the secret?
Good to hear_comma_ glad you guys are happy!
Was he drinking heavy? I'm sorry hope the night wasn't too bad.
I'm sorry to hear that! haha guess he's not invited next time!
Don't be! You are awesome the way you are!
Our imperfections help us stay unique! Do worry yourself with that_comma_ there are so many other things that can get us down and worry us! Just keep being awesome!
Hey... congratulations to you on both fronts! That sounds like double good news. It was probably fun having your hard work rewarded with seeing the faces of all your loved ones and having them personally congratulate you.
Well_comma_ it's good to have you join the workforce in society. You seem like a positive person who can contribute well. Hopefully you find a passion that utilizes your hard-earned degree.
Ahh_comma_ is he a troublemaker right now? Most of the time_comma_ it's the friends they hang out with. Young people are easily influenced by the people around them.
Yes_comma_ he needs a firm hand to lead the way out of this kind of behaviours. You need to step up and introduce some strict schedules so he won't have time to do anything bad. 
Did you get hurt?
Yeah_comma_ gotta be careful one day you might hurt yourself pretty bad
Nice_comma_ what year?
Dang_comma_ that must look great!
im sorry to hearyou were homeles
That is great congrat!
Interesting...you sure it wasn't fish that washed up on the shore
Gotcha..hope that didn't ruin your whole day
Why_comma_ what happened to make you feel that
Nice_comma_ I never understood why that's embarassing haha
Oh wow that sucks! Hope it wasn't too embarassing!
Oh wow I'm sorry! That's not cool_comma_ they would be hurt if people were laughing at them
That's great! Where are they working?
That's got to be frustrating. Have you thought of maybe working at the same place?
That is scary! Hope you did not find yourself in the bad part of town
That is horrible! I bet a little part of you was scared
Oh wow! That is intense! I am glad he didn't get kicked out!
It sounds like it!
That is amazing. Sounds like you have a really good support system.
I have a few. It really does help when times are not so great.
That is pretty neat especially if it gives you good memories!
Now you can carry on that tradition.
I do too. I wish we could have fall weather longer.
Same here and next thing you know it's a blizzard.
Oh what happened instead? Did your friends throw you a party?
Wow! What a great surprise! You should thank the person that planned it!
That is awesome! I cannot wait until my student loans are paid off!
I am happy for you! 
Oh_comma_ don't be! Just have faith in yourself and be confident that you can make it in. 
I see_comma_ think of it as having a conversation with a friend. It will make it easier! 
They do have nice bags! I hope you are able to get one!
They are_comma_ but if you save up a little at a time_comma_ it won't be that bad!
Nice! How are you celebrating for him?
So cute! Take a lot of photos so he'll be able to see them in the future!
Yum! Sushi is so good_comma_ I'm sure you'll enjoy it! I like the eel roll and spicy tuna roll.
I'm sure you will! Maybe start with a simple roll like the california roll or ask the waitress for recomendations. 
Where are you going? I would say if your gut is telling you that it is not good then I would suggest listening to it
Lol. Oh. Coasters are fun. Very exciting!
A "really nice" piece of hair?  Yikes.  Did you send it back?
Well good.  Hopefully you got your food re-made though.  
Oh dang_comma_ that is too bad.  Can you guys video call?
Oh OK_comma_ hopefully you have some friends you can bring over and share your traditions.
I'm right there with you. I've always been a home-body. I don't like going out as much. Sometimes people say millennials and technology have disconnected people too much.. that could be true. But at least we're comfortable doin it.
Absolutely. I'm the kind of person that can be around for people a little bit_comma_ but get drained by them. I think that's getting more and more common for others. Could you tell me what kind of animals you have real quick!
That is awesome_comma_ I was an early reader as well! That is a great accomplishment!!
I hope they both keep the love for reading and writing!
Oh no! I'm so sorry!  Are you able to be up for another one soon?
Oh great! That's sooner than in my company.  I know you'll get one. Just keep working hard and good luck!
It happens to the best of us! I know the lady understands!
Maybe you'll never see her again! 
Sorry to hear that_comma_ I know that you probably feel disappointed but there will be other opportunities! 
Yes_comma_ and you will succeed eventually. 
Do you have some uncertainty in you life right now?
That is really tough.  Are you in a career now?
Do you have any opportunity for an internship of some sort?  The career advisers from your school may be able to help.
I did that myself_comma_ and I can tell you it was well worth it.  I am much happier now than I ever was.  I wish you very good luck on whatever you decide to do!
As in living alone or single?
Oh no. Thats terrible. 
Oh wow_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that! Put your leg up and relax this weekend! 
I hope your insurance does too! Just take care of youself and I hope you feel better soon!
That sounds really frustrating to deal with. You sound like you're self-aware and anticipating the problem_comma_ though. Perhaps you've already started preparing to look elsewhere?
Well_comma_ luckily Google is so helpful these days. There's tons of templates out there. It's kind of annoying to deal with_comma_ especially because it's being motivated by your company possibly disappearing.. but it won't take long at all to craft a good one_comma_ especially because oftentimes the shorter they are_comma_ the better
Nice. Did you find a good hairdresser?
That is great.
I am sorry to hear that! My dog is a part of the family_comma_ so I understand. I hope everything is okay.
It is scary to think about_comma_ I hope for the best!
what did you do?
that is a cool job
That's great. Where are you going?
Sounds like a great trip. I hope you guys have a fun time.
That is exciting. When is she due?
Yes it is! Is she having a boy or a girl?
Awww! Congratulations! I hope everything goes smoothly.
I totally understand.  Life can sometimes seem overwhelming.  I have learned to stop_comma_ take a deep breath_comma_ and do one thing at a time.
It's just a way to calm the body and the mind.  It is SO easy to fall into the trap of anxiety.  But falling there doesn't accomplish a thing.  Take a breath_comma_ focus on one small success_comma_ then move to the next.  
Yikes! Bet the car payment is not worth it. lol
Sometimes jealousy can become us. But most times it does not pay to be that way_comma_ cause 9 times out of 10 those kind of people is just living off credit so technically it is not something they own out right
Woah_comma_ hope she doesn't report you! Jk
I see_comma_ hope she is able to understand!
What are you applying for?
That sounds interesting_comma_ when do you learn if you got in?
What game and what kind of award>
Way to go! That is a great accomplishment!
Oh wow that is so exciting! I'm sure you are excited to move in.
Aww that's great! I have two dogs_comma_ they become part of the family! Enjoy your new house :)
You sound very content. What makes you happy?
Well that is a good reason. You are blessed.
Oh no_comma_ I would have had a heart attack.
Sell the house!
Nice_comma_ how was it?
Hope you're all right!
Are you doing the cheesecake for your family?
That is great.
That's really nice! You should show her you appreciate her. Maybe cook her dinner!
Ahh yes_comma_ that's very nice too_comma_ good for her! You guys have a happy marriage.
Ugh that must so inconvenient and uncomfortable! 
I can relate_comma_ I get red face when ever I have to come infront of the class to present. 
Oh gosh_comma_ is he going to take you to the Superbowl at least?
Just one ticket_comma_ that sounds lonely for him.
Nice! I want to take my daughter when she is older. Did you go to Disneyland or world?
California is fun to visit as well! Glad you all had fun.
aww that is great!
yeah my mom did that for me a few years back
Oh naughty. Did anyone see you?
Well it's not a huge deal in the grand scheme of the universe! I am sure it will be fine.
Are you making a trip to see your family?
Great. It is always good to see your family. Is it very far?
That would definitely be a difficult thing to find out. How did you find out?
Wow. That is really horrible. I am so sorry that happened to you. 
Haha.. I feel like that's almost a rite of passage when going to water parks. I've had that happen_comma_ too. Hopefully it wasn't too traumatic for you. I almost lost my glasses once_comma_ too! Now that was really scary
That's the spirit. It's good that you don't take yourself too seriously. Heck_comma_ my roommate walked in on me doing some "self-pleasure" just yesterday.. I used to think that was my worst nightmare_comma_ but in the moment I just did my best to laugh it off so we could move forward faster
I hate when that happens! The same thing happened to me when I moved out of my apartment. They kept my security deposit because they needed to replace carpet.
Mine hadn't been replaced in 6 years_comma_ I found that out after the fact. 
That's pretty awesome_comma_ congrats
Confidence is key_comma_ it's honestly what upper management looks for not necessarily technical skills right off the bat...just like Leo DiCaprio in "Catch Me if You Can" haha
Good on you. You need to be comfortable in your own skin and its not other people's business to tell you how to live. 
Yes_comma_ they should really learn to concentrate on their own life instead of complaining about other people.
Did you get up to check it out?
That would have scared me. At least it wasnt an intruder.
that is exciting@
yeah same but it can be fun
That is an amazing talent to have. I would be so scared!
Me too_comma_ that would be terrible.
I hope you did it. Don't worry too much.
If you need to you can always take it again. Good luck!
What happened? Hope you are okay?
Omg that is so scary_comma_ I am so sorry to hear that. 
Did you find anything great?
What a wonderful memory.  
Oh hey that's awesome!  That is awesome right?
That is awesome!!!! Congratulations!
