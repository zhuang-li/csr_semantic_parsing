I remember going to see the fireworks with my best friend. It was the first time we ever spent time alone together. Although there was a lot of people_comma_ we felt like the only people in the world.
This was a best friend. I miss her.
We no longer talk.
 it feels like hitting to blank wall when i see the darkness
dont you feel so.. its a wonder 
 i virtually thought so.. and i used to get sweatings
Hi how are you doing today
Im good_comma_ trying to understand how someone can feel like hitting a blank wall when they see the darkness
i dont imagine feeling a lot_comma_ maybe your on to something
I have never cheated on my wife.
Yea it hasn't been easy but I am proud I haven't
Job interviews always make me sweat bullets_comma_ makes me uncomfortable in general to be looked at under a microscope like that. 
I feel like getting prepared and then having a curve ball thrown at you throws you off. 
It's hard to stay clam. How do you do it? 
Hi_comma_ this year_comma_ I was the first over 300 students at my enginering school
It is computer science. I am very happy of this achievement and my family is very proud.
I lost my job last year and got really angry.
Yes_comma_ it was a complete surprise.
During christmas a few years ago_comma_ I did not get any presents.
Since that day christmas has not been a good time for me. As I have no family_comma_ christmas is always the worst.
Some days are just days that you never forget. I wish you could as well.
My coworker is allowed to work remotely_comma_ but I am not...
I do too_comma_ it is unfortnuate because_comma_ unbiased_comma_ I am our best performer_comma_ so it is curious
The other night I was alone and heard a nose coming from the kitchen... it was creepy. 
Hi_comma_ I went to a park and I set on a bench. I didn't notice that my wallet felt. A man came to me from behind giving me back my wallet.
Yes_comma_ I did. I was so grateful because I have a lot of money in my wallet.
People get rejected all the time but it shouldn't be an excuse to let it dissuade you from reaching your goals.
Got rejected from a place I wanted to work_comma_ not once but three times 
Thanks_comma_ they gave me the same generic lines you always hear. 
I had to board my entire house when the hurricane was coming.
No luckily the house was ok.
Once when I was in preschool_comma_ my pants fell down in front of the whole class_comma_ I was so embarassed
It was_comma_ I almost cried cause everyone was laughing at me
I never thought things would go like this.
I was at the beach and a hurricane changed track and was coming straight at us. My boyfriend didnt want to leave because we were on the second day only of our vacation.
Well we ended up leaving I was too scared to stay and was really upset.
What a difference a year makes. Last year one evening my family was at home when a tree fell on the house and broke through the ceiling.
We were OK_comma_ though the tree broke through only a few feet away from my daughter.
Indeed. We were out of the house for five months while repairs were being done_comma_ but now the house is better than ever.
So last week we were watching the world cup_comma_ and lo and behold_comma_ Croatia beat the host country_comma_ Russia
Yes! Both countries were not about to let each other win
You're right. I prefer nerve-wrecking matches. When both teams are great_comma_ the tension really builds.
Hi_comma_ I have a co work always asking me questions about how to use her mobile. It is almost always the same questions.
Yes_comma_ she is. She is telling that all the cell phone that she has been using have deleting her contacts.
I worked on my truck all weekend. Spent $215 on parts and a special tool. Still did not fix the miss in the engine.
It has a miss. Sometimes when you are driving it sputters and jerks and barely has any power. Other times it drives just fine. I have replaced so many things on it and nothing makes a difference for very long.
I found myself divorced a few years ago_comma_ and for the first time in my life_comma_ I was living alone.
Yes_comma_ I felt that way for a while. But then I grew used to the solitude.
I felt proud when I had accomplished a dream that I wanted to do for a long time. It was absailing!!
absailing_comma_ its when you rappeling down a building. What have you down that amazing?
so what have you done?
Hello
Funny - we just built a house where we used to go camping when I was a kid. 
That's wonderful. Do you have any plans to have a fire? 
Planning out my new home has turned out to be a blast!
I just moved in so it is already built. Just working on planning out decorating and appliances and such.
I think I am most excited for all the space I have. I can have friends over and not feel cramped.
I never took a drink before and my friends were all over me to take a drink
It was not my thing and the moment I took I did wrong. Later in the night I started feeling bad.
Yeah I did to my mum and dad...When I started vomiting I mess my dress and mum knew. 
Yeah bad...anyway bye...Thanks for the chat. 
I was only married for 4 weeks when I learned my husband was having an affair and ongoing after the wedding. I got him back by sleeping with a close family friend. I felt guilty and ashamed because it was out of character.
Well I choose to stay and work it out_comma_ but I never told him. It has been 3 years.
Well I thought I would be feel better but because I am not the cheating kind_comma_ I still feel guilty.
When I was working my first job_comma_ my parents picked me up in my new car_comma_ I was very surprised_comma_ i thought I was gonna have to buy my own car
Yeah it really was_comma_ I am still very thankful of them
I'm nearing 40 and I find myself thinking a lot about my teen years and early twenties. The friends I had then and the fun we had.
I don'
A year ago I spent a lot of time doing research for an article. Then a top journal accepted it for publication.
It was about the medieval poet Geoffrey Chaucer.
He was an English poet in the fourteenth century_comma_
Do you have any irritating coworkers?
yes a few that drive me nuts. the janitor is the worst
she comes in my office smelling like smoke trying to chat it up rather than do her job. 
Hi_comma_ I broke a statuette offered by grandmother to my sister. It was a very important object for my sister.
No_comma_ it is not possible. It is old statuette given by the mother of my grandmother.
I could not tolerate the waiters insensitivity_comma_that's poor service indeed!
Imagine _comma_I requested a French fries _comma_but was served burger instead!
I left his house_comma_ filled up with his food and disgust. I left his fridge completely empty and feel guilth
Thanks man_comma_ at the heat of the moment I ate due to my flashbacks I was traumised.
Hi I was recently on vacation and frightened half to death.
I was eating some chips on the balcony. I dropped them and then was swarmed by seagulls.
I went inside. I donr know how dangerous they are but I didnt want to fall 7 stories.
When i was younger_comma_ my mother would always take away my PC because I would always play video games on them.
Now that I am older though_comma_ my girlfriend tries to take away my Pc. Very rough days in my life.
Stop doing that_comma_ it is very important to have a pc. The internet is the future and very many jobs are opening up online.
I think at 3am the mind is truly it's sharpest and can make great content. I do understand the age thing though. Maybe slowly give her more time as she gets older. At 15 to 16 it gets hard to control all together.
One of my friend didn't keep this promise he made to me. I was so angry to him.
I was suppose to help me move from my apartment. He didn't come and turned off his cell phone.
There were times where I was being seduced by a coworker of mine as a married man.
I was the one who was being seduced as the married man.  Good thing I remained committed to my wife and did not cheat.
I am an English Tutor for Chinese students_comma_ when they struggle with a topic_comma_ I always take extra time to help them along and make sure they understand
I like it very much_comma_ seeing a kid grasp a new concept and very quickly and finding effective ways to do it is a blast.
Have you ever had a pet that you had to put down? I was so heartbroken when my dog of 16 years had to be put down. this was years ago but it still makes me sad to this day.
That is true_comma_ we got her when I was 3 years old so I kind of grew up with her_comma_ I'll never forget those memories.
I drove to Dairy Queen but it was closed. 
I just really wanted some ice cream! Now I know their hours_comma_ though.
One time I had a flat tire and my dad came to help me fix it.
I ran over a nail in the road.  Now I know not to drive near new houses.
My kid's birthday are coming up again. It always makes me remember them as babies.
They are. All the sights and sounds of babies are so precious to remember.
When I was a little child my parents told me that we were going to the amusement park and it made me so happy
It was fun for sure_comma_ all the rides and the food_comma_ it brings back great memories.
Have you ever been to the amusement park?
My wife and I decided to go on an iternational trip last year_comma_ and it was my first trip out of the US. It was an amazing experience_comma_ and one of the best and most memorable things I've ever done.
My wife was amazing. She booked the whole trip for us_comma_ and planned out some things for us to do while we were there. The person's house we stayed at was also really great_comma_ and helped us find our way around Auckland.
Super nice_comma_ the locals were always willing to help us navigate around_comma_ and had great recommendations for things to try while we were there.
Onnce I had to take care of my cousin who had an ailing stomach
Apparently he ate something and slept immediately
Yeah I had to tell him either to sleep first for a bit than eat. Or eat at first and wait an hour
I felt afraid. Still i remember it
Two years ago_comma_ i was admitted in hospital. I was ill
Luckily
We have a new manager at work and it isnt going well. 
I do sales work_comma_ but he always lies to us and takes our bonus money. 
You are never going to believe what I did
Well_comma_ I normally do not feel comfortable lending things to my friends_comma_ but recently I mustered up the trust to loan my friend my vehicle.
Well_comma_ I have known him for a while and I have never seen him drive crazy_comma_ so im just hoping all goes well.  It is just for a day_comma_ but a lot can happen in a day.
I went shopping yesterday and bought a $2000 bag. My husband is going to kill me..
All women have the same problem. It is a guilty pleasure..
I hate to be tired and see a store crowded with customers and only one or two checkouts open.
Especially when it's a time of day that they know will be crowded and busy.
I don't mind those sometimes_comma_ sometimes I prefer they do it.
There was a person who had to do twice the amount of work that they usually do. Sounded like they need to fire whoever didn't do their job 
Maybe there should be a training day where they do back over everything_comma_ 
That too! If only
So our new manager has changed our bonus structure causing us to never hit bonus..
Its frustrating when I go from 24 an hour to 10 an hour because of his lies. 
I had a chance to make some money_comma_ but my phone screwed up
yes i did_comma_ but i still can not get that money
Last year I was so excited to be moving.
We moved back to our hometown. We were so looking forward to being near family and friends again.
i bumped into a car while reversing_comma_ i had to wait long to talk to owner of the other car
It was indeed. the worst part was not able to get hold of him. He parked and wandered somewhere.
Yeah i missed my movie..
I was having a bad day the other day but my spouse went and surprised me with my favorite food. 
I know it was rather sweet of them... i love anything asian! 
We just got back from vacation and our sleep times are off. It is really messing with me.
I went to bed at a decent time last night. When I woke up my kids were still up watching cartoons!
I like getting things done in the yard_comma_but I feel so dirty afterwards.
The grass makes me itchy_comma_ But the shower afterward feels great.
So the other day I had a crazy long day and got home to find all of my chocolate was gone! 
I know right! ..._comma_ but atleast I had some amaretto in the fridge.. lol 
My daughter_comma_ Brooklyn_comma_ has finally overcame her fear of water and learned to swim! It makes me so happy to see her loving the water.
She is 4. She normally is completely fearless_comma_ compared to my son who is afraid of everything. Haha! So I love that she has worked so hard to overcome this.
Thank you_comma_ and same to you! I hope you enjoy many happy swimming days with your little princess. 
Hi_comma_ I am concerned about the financial situation of my employer.
I don't think it is a good idea. There was a layout off six month ago. 
So I am home from work and Marks car was outside. I went in and him and Liz were kissing on the couch.
I made them both leave but me and Liz are breaking up. 
I asked her to come and pack her bags. Enough is enough I can not do this with her anymore.
Did you go outside and see if anyone was hurt?
I heard a noise outside that sounded like a car had wrecked yesterday.
So after I left the club last night I noticed the Taxi had old throw up in it still.
I still took it since it was late but I rode in the front seat.
It was gross but I was super tired. I only paid half for the ride though.
My marriage give me hopefulness about the life. exactly I want to say is may not it's marriage actually it's my wife given me the hope about the life. 
Yeah_comma_ thank you! at which situation did you feel hope for your life?
Wow! you're right. We should learn from kids. 
The other day when I was cleaning I came across an old keychain my dad gave me when I was younger_comma_ it was nice to see. 
Yeah it meant a lot to me - almost like a sign! 
My handyman keeps telling me he's coming by to fix my leaky sink_comma_ but he never shows up when he says he will_comma_ ugh.
Oh yeah_comma_ and it goes to his answering machine every time.
Thanks I will.
My co worker keeps getting told how great of a job he is doing and I know hes doing wrong to get all the sales. 
Doubtful_comma_ but I sure hope so! He gets a 100 dollar bonus every week because of his ways..
It was amazing sitting on the stage in that hug auditorium.
Music. Some of the hardest music that professionals play.
yes i was
I am satisfied to have a good vacation
Nothing special. I just travel to my familly. It has been almost a year that I didn't see them.
So the other day my daughter went potty for the first time on her own! 
Shes 18 months old_comma_ it really is amazing to see them develop. If only people clapped for us when we used the bathroom... ha ha 
The other day after dinner my daughter took her trash to the trash on her own. I love watching her develop! 
Shes just starting to try to say full sentences_comma_ but right now its just a lot of babbling and drooling. lol
i am angry against a friend that suppose to help me.
I wanted to wall mount my TV but my friend didn't come and turned off his cell phone. I was always helping him for anything.
I traveled a few months ago and didnt realize how much planning is involved! Wow it was a lot to get ready for... 
I went to Peru to visit my family. I try to go every year. 
I have a small circle of friends. They are like my family.
Around ten years. I let my friends borrow my debit card the other day. A stranger wouldve wiped me out.
Yep. Trust them with my life.
So we had a meeting at work this week. Turns out we may have to shut down in the next few months.
I feel like if they go through with it they have to offer us packages right?
Yeah I think a bunch of us are going to meet up after work and talk about it.
The other day I got a bonus from work_comma_ which was amazing because i have recently got behind in bills. 
I wasnt expecting it_comma_ but basically because my stats were above 
So I went to see the new Marvel movie with Thanos. It was so good and I am so pumped up now.
It was called Infinity War! You should find time to see it.
I think the new villain Thanos might be my favorite bad guy ever!
I am afraid my neighbors are causing snakes to come over my way.
They aren't clean and I've been getting a lot of mice_comma_ and snakes follow them I think.
good idea
Today is my birthday! I am 34!
Nothing today since its Thursday_comma_ hopefully I can bar hop this weekend. Waiting for gifts today.
me too. I love goodies.
I was so excited to move to a new state_comma_ but when i moved into my apartment it was full of bugs! ugh
me too.. i really was freaking out. 
I was disappointed by my manager when he told that I will probably get my promotion next year (not this year)
No_comma_ I tried everything. It is like betrayed me.
I get to go to the water park today! I cant wait. 
Its so much fun_comma_ really pretty down there too. Oh in a few hours! 
I went out last weekend and had a major accident. Guess what happened...
I'm fine. Just a litte embarassed. I ripped my leggings dancing on bourbon street.
Yep. My shirt was long enough to cover it. Plus I don't live there lol.
me too.
So last night I was driving down this road and my car died and I had no lights.
I was sitting their for over 6 hours in the dark and night.
Well I finally got a signal and was able to get my brother to come and help me.
My house feels like its taking forever to sell...but I have a feeling something good is going to come soon! 
It's been almost 3 months now_comma_ but not 1 offer. 
I have been going to school for whar seems like forever.
I did. I am going to finish soon though.
Recently_comma_ I have been annoyed by a coworker making jokes about me.
It is bothering me a lot. This coworker is not competent and he spend this time making jokes on other people.
My daughter fell the other day pretty hard_comma_ I had to hold her until she calmed down. 
Yeah it wasnt too bad just a couple scrapes_comma_ its hard seeing your kids get hurt. 
I really dislike my neighbors. They are the worst.
They argue constantly and we live in apartments so I can hear everything. They even call the police a lot.
Yes_comma_ but I think they know the landlord.
So last Friday I was driving home from work and this guy just cuts me off in traffic.
Well I to swerve onto the shoulder and almost caused a accident. Some people are just jerks on the road. 
Nothing upsets me more than seeing teenagers on their phones. It really boils my blood.
I was lost in a neighborhood I didn't know_comma_ when some guy came up to me and quietly asked if I needed a ride.
I wouldn't know. I defnitely didn't want to risk it and declined the offer!
Wasn't worth taking the chance to find out on that one haha. But it could've gotten bad_comma_ but I'm glad there were lots of cars passing by at the time.
So this is going to sound crazy but_comma_ one day I am going to win the lottery. 
Pay off my debts from moving number 1_comma_ and then buy a house! What would you do with the money? 
I will pass a examen next monday. I reviewed all the content for the course
Yes_comma_ I feel ready. I can't wait to take that exam
Last month_comma_ my boss gave me a 10% raise_comma_ even though I didn't ask fo it. It was quite the welcome surprise!
Yeah_comma_ we have always gotten along well_comma_ and he has always been very supportive of me.
I've lost my job and am behind on my mortgage. It scares me that I could lose my home.
Thank you. I've been working odd and ends and am looking for a job that pays more of course. How did you overcome that time?
Today is my birthday!
Still recovering from a road trip but hopefully things will get exciting this weekend!
New Orleans IT was great
Cool
So last week I was supposed to meet Mary and workout with her. But I kind of lied...
I told her I had to go out of town and instead I just stayed home all day.
Because We do it everyother day and I did not want to seem lazy.
Yeah I just kinda feel bad about doing it...
Recently someone offered me an extreme amount of money for a work at home job... 
It sounded too good to be true honestly it made me feel a little uneasy... i had to turn it down! 
so i applied for 200+ jobs and i can't believe i didn't hear from none of them!
just any job at this point. just a full time stable job
thank you!
Last night I went into my kitchen and ate all of my kids cookies.
Well my wife confronted me this morning and I blamed it on our dog Max.
Yeah my wife had been kinda cold torwards him since. I feel bad for him..
I have lived in my apartment for 5 years now.
It's getting smaller_comma_ but my friends used to come over more. Now I'm by myself all the time.
Sounds like a plan
I recently moved to my dream location_comma_ but it sucks not knowing anyone. 
That actually sounds like a really good idea! Thank you... now to decide what to cook.. lol
so i saw a snake outside my apartment today_comma_ i hate snakes_comma_ so disgusting eww
went back inside the house and called animal control. it looked like a copperhead so i'm not messing with them
i totally would. lol i hate snakes and bugs and spiders
So they just posted online about how they are not making a sequel to Hot Fuzz.
I guess it just did not get enough funding. It just sucks because it is my favorite movie.
That is what im thinking but you can never tell with these things.
I was able to save a blind lady from falling down an escalator.
She was very alarmed and rightfully so. I'm usually not a nice person_comma_ but I'm glad I did the right thing that time!
I am so sick of my job not paying us for the proper amount of hours! 
It seems like it doesnt it.. i hope it gets better. 
I was mowing the lawn_comma_ and a rock flew and broke my neighbor's window.
They didn't even know what happened_comma_ but I got myself to let them know although I was terribly scared of the expenses.
I hadn't worn a bathing suit in maybe 5 uears until recently.
I had gained a little weight and got embarassed.
I have one now. I saw a bunch of ladies strutting in their suits and iy boosted my confidence. I had a ball at the beach the next day.
Online. I can't say the store name. I won't allow me
My grandmother passed away unexpectedly a few years ago.
Yes it is. She was the grandparent I was closest to.
Yes_comma_ I believe that time is the best way to heal.
You as well. Have a great day.
I wish I could work less.. i feel so bad that i dont get to spend as much time with my daughter. 
Ive been trying what I really need is a higher paid one so that way I dont have to work 2 jobs. 
My friend called someone a bad name_comma_ he really mad me upset.
I did and then we got into a argument about it.
My fence is collapsing at areas where my neighbors keep climbing over to get their ball. It's going to be expensive to fix.
I'm afraid to unfortunately. They broke the window once_comma_ and I had to get police involved.
I cant wait to relocate and move again. I am so ready. 
New York_comma_ VA_comma_ FL... how about you? 
My brother usually doesn't do anything for me unless asked. After 3 decades_comma_ he actually took me out for my birthday.
haha siblings! How many brothers do you have?
Today is my birthday and I got a call yesterday wishing me a happy birthfay from my ex.
Thanks. It wouldve been a good thing if he didn't call last month to tell me happy birthday also. He should know when my birthday is after 11 years lol
Aint that the truth!!!
I went to the optometrist_comma_ and my prescription got strong. She warned me about being at risk for losing my vision.
Oh yes. That is smart. After the warning_comma_ I use the screen dimming program called f.lux.
My old high school is being sold and turned into an old people's apartment complex. Sad to see it go. 
Yes_comma_ They consolidated and it's awful. The kids now have a thirty minute bus ride one way to school.
I know. We have a lot of snow in the winter too. So it's dangerous also.
It was my birthday and my mother came to surprise me.
She showed up to my house and brought me a cake.
I still remember the day i had to say goodbye to my dad. :( 
He had a heat stroke in the middle of July. 
Today is my birthday! I think tonight we are all going out.
I think to a amusment park but im not sure!
Thank you! I hope you have a good dau.
It was insane getting ready for hurricane IRMA to hit last year.... 
We did but it wasnt too bad_comma_ not as bad as the news made it out to sound. 
My neighbor went back to school at 59. She just got her bachelor's this year.
Yea. She's a pretty amazing lady to do that and inspirational of course. What are you in school for?
It makes me sad to be single nowadays.
IF two years is recent lol. Today is my birthday and I don't want to cook.
I think I will.
My friend's boyfriend got into an accident 5 years ago. She's still with him.
Got into a motorcycle accident and is now paraplegic. They're doing just fine! He's got his pride issues_comma_ but she's sticking with him.
So last night a cop pulled me over.
He said I was speeding but I was really nervous.
No he let me off with a warning.
I've been taking care of my aging mom for 5 years now and don't really have any friends_comma_ since so much time is used taking care of her.
Thank you. Can't afford outside help unfortunatley. Yes. I have picked up exercising though.
A little baby turtle was crossing the road the other day and I was in a hurry and didn't stop and help him. I hope he made it. I usually stop and take them to a creek away from the road. Darn!
They're so pitiful with their little heads up _comma_ like where are you mom_comma_ where did you go. 
They come down a mountain and the creek is on the opposite side of the road I believe
My mom has arthritis in her neck_comma_ and the pain seems to be traveling down now.
The doctor just recommended exercise. I'm not sure if they were just busy to do anymore for her or if exercise is the best.
I am so impatient right now... waiting for the clock to hit 5 so I can go on vacation! 
4 hours to go! ahhh
So my boss sent me over to close the deal with the Mr Harris. I felt so happy closeing a big client like that.
He signed right away and we had a drink to celebrate.
Well lets just say I think im going to get that bonus.
I was in the woods and a snake came out of no where.
Luckily it did not. I was fine just scared.
My mom went back to school at 63 and recently got her bachelor's in computer science!
Yea. I mean I can't even code. And there goes my mom who didn't even know a browser was_comma_ now coding!
I finally finished my Phlebotomy class . It was an hour's drive one way_comma_ but thankfully it's over and a hospital nearby is hiring I heard. Whew!
I would probably tell them to look the other way and that it really isn't very painful. 
Or pass out on me_comma_ lol. Thanks 
Had a interview yesterday. I think it went pretty well. I hope I get the job.
Thank you. I did actually. The recruiter sounded pretty positive on the phone.
I bought a lottery ticket and have a feeling I will win.
I know my chances are not good but maybe I can get lucky.
My birthday was last weekend_comma_ and no one wished me a Happy Birthday.
It is. I've been absorbed in work for the last 3 years and haven't gone out. So I guess everyone kinda moved on without me.
For my 30th birthday_comma_ my family and friends got together and threw me a surprise birthday party.
It was held at my parent's house in New Orleans.
Last year my family surprised me for my birthday with a party.
The vet told me my cat only has a few weeks left to live.
I plan on it! He is really old so it is just his time to go and I get that but that doesnt make it any easier.
Yeah It is just one of those things we all have to go through at some point.
A friend tried to get me to go out to a bar and hang out behind my spouses back... 
I havent yet_comma_ but I agree with you I should. I just dont want them to be upset with my friends. 
I would too. Deff need to. 
I hate being envious_comma_ but I've needed a car for months and my friend just bought a new one.
I guess so. It is a really nice car.
lol. i like you!
I had to put my dog to sleep and it was super stressing! :( 
Thanks_comma_ it always sucks when you have to say goodbye.. but shes better off now without pain. Do you have any pets? 
Went out with my friends last night after not seeing each other for a year. I was in another country for work and just got back.
Yea. It was nice learning about the culture there_comma_ and people were really nice.
I think I found someone that's interested in my house finally . It's been on the market for over a year now. 
I will move to a less rural area. It's very isolated and you have to have a vehicle for transportation.
No_comma_ that's why I'm selling actually. 
I'll get to go on vacation tomorrow. Been working really hard to get things clear up so I can enjoy myself.
Japan! Looking forward to the food.
Recently I offered to start working extra long hours just to help support my family more. 
Yeah we recently moved so we have gotten in quite debt while trying to sell the previous home! ugh 
Just moved here for work_comma_ and I don't know anyone. My coworkers have families of their own.
Yea. It's going to take some time. It's just tough going through it right now.
I went to grocery store the other day and completely embarassed myself.
I filled an entire cart with food for a party and then realized I had forgot me purse at home.
Yes. MY apartment is close by but It was still embarrassing
I cant wait to buy my christmas tree this year_comma_ lol.. funny right? ...but I am actually really excited. 
I thought about it_comma_ but dont think I could handle one. Do you have one? 
I visited my old home town recently and it has gone down hill so much.  A lot of the houses are run down and dilapidated. So sad.
Yeah_comma_ I got to see a few people I knew . It was still fun
Thank you . Hope you get a vacation this year too.
So I came home from work yesterday and when I walked in the apartment Sally had all my friends and family inside.
It was a surprise party I turned 25. I honestly thought they all had forgotten.
MY daughter started a new school last year.
I was more afraid than she was. It was a big transistion. All girls and she is 13.
Not one person. But she did end up making a lot of new friends and doing well in her classes. I am so proud of her.
i was excited when i was a child and found out my firned could come over and play
Yes it was so much simpler. We got excited for the smallest things
yes me too
I was in the middle of a long distance move_comma_ and somehow misplaced my drivers registration and car insurance!!! 
I know I was so scared_comma_ and nervous.. it almost ruined the entire trip. 
So Bob got the promotion at work even though I put in all those hours.
They made us both take a test. I geuss he scored better than me.
I think we get another chance in the winter.
My neighbor's kid just lost his eyesight. The whole family is devastated.
His vision was gradually getting worse. Suddenly_comma_ his vision got really blurry one day and they called emergency.
I once went to see fireworks with my best friend. Best day of my life. We're no longer friends.
No. I am too embarassed to reach out to her after all these years.
So I found something out the other night that made me extremely upset! 
My child went out behind my back_comma_ and snuck out! 
So I just saw how they are going to have a remake of Fist of Fury.
It is a old movie that came out in the 80s. I remember seeing it as a kid!
Yeah it is a old black and white Karate movie
One time there was a large mouse in my kitchen.
I closed the door and put a towel under it. IT was late so i couldn't call maintenence til thehmorning.
Yes. He had chewed a hole under my sink so they boaded it up and put down traps.
I think our job might be laying us off. 
Doubtful honestly.. they dont seem to care very much. :/
So after a year of being here we finally got to rearrange the garage.
I think we will be able to get two cars in here now!
So my cat of 10 years past away last night. I dont know what to do
He is really old but I hate that it happened you know?
I like to give to charity.
Whatever my local pharmacy is giving to at the time. I donate my change since I shop there a lot. It adds up.
Every litlle bit counts. Eventually I will be able to write a check.
So I lost my wallet and had to get a new ID issued to me.
I usually dont have much cash on me but the cards are hard to replace.
Im going to my first concert this weekend. Yesssssss! 
I bought them_comma_ woulda been cool to win them though right? lol 
When the Falcons won the game I was excited.
The NFC championship.
There was a big storm here last week.
The power went out for about 15 and scared the crap out of me_comma_ but other than that we were fine.
The ones I have back ups so they never went out.
I was impressed with the new Tesla that I test drove.
Over 100mph.
I managed to change the oil in my car on my own without breaking anything...
I havent changed my oil in years since my dad taught me so... it was an achievement for sure. 
I should really try to get a girlfriend or something. I just need to feel someone.
Yeah I just feel like it is no use. 
OK I geuss I can try to apply myself more.
The other day during breakfast my daughter started choking and I panicked. 
Yeah I was able to get the food unlodged but wow it was super scary. Shes okay now thanks! 
It was for science but I had notes i had brought.
No we are allowed to bring notes it was just a surprise test. I felt happy about being able to bring mine.
I got a A! the highest score in the class.
My grandma died. I am so sad.
Age but she also smoked.
I use to hate the dark when I was little.
Yes. I had a nightlight to help.
I was. I use to have a nightlight to help.
So I was at cheeleading last night and this girl did a double backflip!
Yeah! It was just really fast and she went up really high!
Everyone got on there feet and clapped for her. She had to be only 10 or so.
I got into Harvard. Can you believe it?
In the Fall.
it annoys me that my wife keeps giving our son a stick even though he hurts himself every single time
i did_comma_ she calls me a helicopter parent and just laughs at me
I am afraid of clowns.
Yes I saw that movie and cried.
I took a trip over the weekend where we stayed at a nice hotel with a balcony overlooking the pool.
Yes in Biloxi. The balcony had a downside though. The seagulls would always try to steal your food. 
There were like 5 of them trying to steal my crackers. I was scared.
When I got in my car to go to work I notcied a note on my seat.
It was from my 7 year old son_comma_ He wanted to tell me he loved me and wished he could come work with me_comma_
I think I am going to take him out for icecream.
I cheated on a test. I am very ashamed.
I would but I will get in trouble.
I miss my family members as they all pretty much gone now...
Yeah_comma_ as you get older you have to face the fact of loved ones not being around forever.
My condolences to you...I hope you have wonderful memories of her!
I almost died last year.
Yes I was very lucky.
Went for a dip at the pool late one night on vacation.
It was a heated ppol so that was nice. But when I jumped in some of may hair extension came out!
Yes luckily no one else was there.
I am afraid of ghosts.
I hope I never meet a ghost.
I always am prepared for hurricanes.
I love Texas.
So i got a huge bonus at work last week!
It was enough that I was able to pay off my car and a lot of bills.
It was a 84 Mustang.
My apartment is right near the dumpster for our commplex.
no. That's not the problem. Sometimes people leave their trash on the outside and then there are a lot of raccoons out there at night.
I have for 5 years. Everyone should just move awawy and I live here alone lol.
I hope I win the lottery this week.
Maybe we can split it if we win.
My friend is so annoying.
He just talks too much.
I was so happy when my son was born.
I won't tell anyone.
Halloween can't get here quick enough.
It is my favorite. I love dressing up with my kids and eating all of their candy.
So I went to pick up Lucy last night for our date. I was very polite and nice.
We meet online on a dating site. I was nervous but I did not let it show and took charge.
We have plans to go out next week!
I am so happy I graduated college.
Yes and I had a 4.0
Got asked to my boss' office. Thought I was getting bad news but turns out I was offered a promotion.
I definitely did!
I have studied and am sure I will pass the test.
I expect an A.
How about our president huh?
Lol. There is no joy here. But I think the only way to go is up now.
I let my new neighbors borrow our lawnmower. It came back broken.
No. They went pretty quiet.
My daughter is being so lazy this summer.
13. I ate her dinner yesterday because she just refused to get up. I feel bad about it now
she went to bed lo
I lied to the police. I am ashamed.
I said I did not know where my friend was.
I got tickets to go to the Amusment park this weekend.
Well they have one near my job. My son a Jack really wants to go so I am taking him.
Yeah he has been talking about it all week long!
Went to the beach the other day and remember how much my friend liked going together.
Yea. I enjoyed it alot. That's why it made me think of my buddy.
Don't you hate when you order food and it is terrible.
We ordered Krystals on a road trip and couldn't even take it back because it would have cost too much time on the road. I was so upset.
I don't anymore.
I tried to catch a criminal but he got away.
Yes but only a small knife.
I forget the lines in the school play. I was so embarrassed.
Yes. I was the main character.
I got stock from family a long time ago. I just let it sit there. It's risen 10 times since.
It's enough to pay 1 year's worth of mortgage. Wondering if I should sell it or hold now.
So last night at work I lost my keys_comma_ I search the office for like 30 minutes.
I did but the entire office was watching me the whole time. I hated looking stupid like that.
Yeah i guess it was still very annoying. I think some people laughed at me.
I just applied for a promotion_comma_ and I should earn at least 10k more.
I hope so! It will help finances a lot.
Last time I was at my parent's house I went through some old photo albums and started reminiscing.
I just thought about how easy and carefree life was when I was a child. I was never alone and always had something to do.
I have younger brothers that are 7 years younger than I am so I was an only child for awhile.
My cousin just got out of a 7 year relationship. Turns out she was cheating for the last 3 years.
I don't get it either. I hope he can move on.
Do you watch game of thrones?
I love that show. I'm sad it is ending. It should stay on forever.
Nest season is the last. I was hoping it would last forever like the simpsons.
I have had enogh of this summer heat. Cmon autumn!
It gets do hot in memphis. My daughter is ready for school to start back anyway_comma_
Me too! Been here all of my life.
I was content with a B on my exam.
Yes I studied hard to pass.
We have a work presentation coming up soon. I think we've got everything to present.
Yea. I hope we didn't miss anything. We spent a lot of time on it.
I'm very excited to take a vacation with my wife. We've been wanting to stay in a cabin for awhile.
Yeah_comma_ we haven't gone on a romantic vacation in over a year_comma_ so I'm really looking foward to it.
Man_comma_ I met this girl one time on Tinder and I totally thought we had great chemistry_comma_ but then she completely ghosted me after.
Aw that's awful_comma_ I wouldn't wish that on anybody. She was laughing and all smiley and everything_comma_ I can't imagine why she ghosted me.
Whenever I see my friends on FB posting photos from my hometown I always start to miss it a little. 
I havent been back yet but maybe I will in the winter so I can experience the snow again. 
My friend is having a drink and paint party for her birthday tomorrow.
A bottle of moscato. She likes that.
We will.
I wish I was The Rock.
The actor The Rock.
My son was prett slow to start speaking.
I took him to get evaluatd and we are waiting for a spot to open at school. I practiced at home with him non stop though and now he won't shut up. I'm so proud of him
I knew he could do it. Moms always overreact.
I was surprised when Trump won the election.
Yes_comma_ Big upset.
I recently lost my job_comma_ and am having trouble finding another one. 
Its a scary situation to be in but like you I almost pretty much applying to anything out there! 
Hi_comma_ how are you?
I have been better_comma_ I just am kind of annoyed with lying.  Does lying annoy you also/
Yea_comma_ its the worst.  Especially when someone lies to you and you forgive them_comma_ but that little bit of anxiety is always in you thinking "what if they are lying now again?".
I had the worst time last week. I went with my girlfriend to see one of her friends and she talked to him with so much more energy and passion than she does with me.
That's so terrible to hear about. Do girls not understand that men also want to be valued over some random guys that they meet or even just see on the street? It's crazy to me that they are so rude sometimes.
I was prepared for my History test due to studying.
Yes but I was prepared.
I just got off the phone with one of my old buddies that I met for the first time in years yesterday and we are gonna go hang out sometime on Sunday! It just makes me really happy to think that we are reconnecting.
We met yesterday at this restaurant and just had some good conversation_comma_ ate some food_comma_ and caught up with each other's lives.
Some garlic bread_comma_ some hot wings_comma_ and a few slices of pizza.
I can't believe the Falcons blew the Super Bowl. I was there.
It had never happened before.
I love football_comma_ are you ready for the season?
August_comma_ Can't wait.
I was apprehensive to get married.
No_comma_ but I am still worried.
I let Daisy my cat out the other evening and she didn't come back home.
two days. I live by a road _comma_ so I'm afraid she'll go in that direction.
I've seen a lot of animals killed on the highways. Its so sad. 
thanks _comma_ nice chatting with you 
my apartment is terrible.
We aren't supposed to_comma_ but I did anyway. Got to make the best out it.
I know it seems late_comma_ but I'm 19 and I went on my first date only about one month ago. 
Beforehand I was really nervous that I was gonna mess it up and make things awkward. Contrary to that it really wasn't too bad!
This Italian restaurant and an escape room too.
I am scared of how I will die.
I hope mine isn't painful.
I love hockey_comma_ are you ready for the season?
I love the Leafs.
I think I have some pretty decent kids. May be too soon to tell though.
My oldest is 13. She is the worst. But my 2 and 3 year old are perfect lol
lol. she is upset about everything all of time. I couldnt have been that way lol
That's hilarious. Maybe II was terrible too then.
My transmission went out in my car at the worst possible time. No way could I afford to get it replaced or rebuilt. My dad was able to loan me $500 to get the new transmission_comma_ and my step dad was able to put it in.
It's still a work in progress_comma_ but we tested the transmission before we put it in. It works wonderfully and came out of a car that only has 90_comma_000 miles on it_comma_ versus mine that has 200_comma_000. I would like to get a new car_comma_ but I don't want to take on another payment until my house is paid off.
Yes it is! Especially for two!
Of course she does! Lol that's hilarious_comma_ but I know how hard teenagers are so it's kind of almost serious too. 
Had HELLP syndrom with first child. Spent all 9 months being pregnant with 2nd child worrying about the same thing happening.
It's basically when eclampsia has progressed to the point that your blood won't clot and your organs start shutting down.
MY car has been down for about a month. Every time I leave the house I see all brand new cars.
I'm saving for a new one. I didn't even have it a year. 
Nope. I bought it cash from obviously a snake oil salesman.
I am always alone in the summer.
My wife goes to Canada to visit her mom.
I was feeling really ambitious the other day and I decided to drive into the parking lot of my old elementary school just to see all the things I used to see years ago.
It was exactly the same! I was super surprised that no renovations were made_comma_ the same playground and buildings and everything.
My sister in law basically lives off of my mother in law and her kids get everything. My mother in law rarely gives our kids anything because we have the money to do it ourselves - and I get a bit miffed at times.
She always says "If I didn't buy it for them_comma_ they wouldn't have it".  But it's a bit ridiculous because my sister in law DOES have the money_comma_ she just refuses to raise her own children.
I really like the new football coach.
The Falcons and their new defensive coach.
I am so proud to be an American.
No I am not.
We tried for a baby for a long time_comma_ almost 4 years. Waiting those 9 months to meet her were so hard!
We have two now and they are both almost grown - time for grandkids I guess!
I feel bad I stole a cookie from the cookie jar.
Yes. I ate it quick.
I had been doing poorly in college for a while.
I do now. I passed all of my classes last semester_comma_ so I think I;m back on track.
University of Memphis
I've got a job interview next week. I'm feeling a little uneasy about it.
Yeah_comma_ I'm definitely excited for it
I recently had a court date for child support.
The other party didn't show up so they put out a warrant for him. I don't have to go back now.
They always do and then we start all over again. It's sad.
I am ok with being fat.
I weight more than I should.
I am excited for baseball playoffs. Are you?
I love the Yankees.
I had jury duty for three months this spring. Its was surprisingly fun and interesting. 
It can be an inconvenience and it only paid 12 dollars a day. So that was bad.
really bad.
I can't believe it hasn't rained today.
Yes we need rain.
We have had some big rain storms this spring and summer. The creek behind my house got in my yard twice. Very scary.
Not this time. But it did a little bit in 2009. and the mud and mess was unbelievably hard to clean up. 
You get very stressed out _comma_ like post traumatic stress disorder when it starts raining lol
Ugh I was so mad the other day_comma_ I went to the store and was grocery shopping. When I came out_comma_ I noticed my car was very scratched on the back bumper. I was so furious and angry_comma_ and I still am. 
No! That's the worst part. I can understand if someone left a note to say sorry. But no :(
Thank you_comma_ I really appreciate that. Makes the situation a little more bearable. 
I'm still kinda bummed about this_comma_ but like a month or more back I was really into this girl from Tinder and we started dating too. Unfortunately_comma_ after like 4 or 5 days_comma_ she said she wanted to stop dating and hasn't spoken to me since.
It's fine_comma_ I'm feeling a lot better about it. The thing that irks me is that she went from super happy about dating to literally ending it and ghosting me in so little time. Makes me think it was all fake_comma_ but I can't think why she would do it.
We had a really good time on our vacation a couple of weeks ago.
We went to Disney world with some friends who had never been before.  We are passholders so we have been several times_comma_ but it was fun getting to see it throught the eyes of someone who had never been before.
We had a great time!  We both have small kids so they loved playing together_comma_ and it was nice to get to help show our friends the ropes and all the 'secrets' lol
It is for me.  I am very type A_comma_ and getting to plan and coordinate everything is right up my alley!
It was a really bad experience. Especially since I wasted all the ingredients! 
Yes_comma_ it was my nephew's birthday party pizza. And I promised him I would make his favorite pepperoni pizza! 
We had to order from a fast food chain! It wasn't bad_comma_ but fair to say_comma_ my nephew was disappointed in me.
It left in the oven and was distracted by my boss
I was very afraid in airplane because of severe turbulence.
I was not able to cope with it. I had a severe panic attack.
It is something that was really important to her_comma_ and I still feel bad that I missed her 15th birthday 
My cousin_comma_ she really wanted me to attend her party since she enjoys my cooking and I had planned on making cookies
Hi! One time when driving on fresh snow I almost wiped out into a ditch_comma_ that scared me
I did end up being okay_comma_ but man was I nervous and shaking
I really enjoyed taking care of my nephew yesterday. His mother had left him with me since she had work.
I agree. We just played xbox and had snacks. I feel he really enjoyed his time.
My brother applied for an Ivy League school this year_comma_ and we just found out he was accepted!
Yeah_comma_ it was vey exciting news_comma_ I'm so proud of him.
I am trying to sell my house for 89k dollars_comma_ I have been in a bad financial situation_comma_ my nephew knows it_comma_ and now he is trying to buy my house just for 75k_comma_ trying to take advance of my situation
I have no idea_comma_ I guess his husband is evil 
me too_comma_ and do you know what makes me mad?  When I had a good job_comma_ I helped them a lot_comma_ and now they are trying to do this to me
I know_comma_ right? My own nephew trying to do this with me
My brother graduated high school_comma_ I was very proud of him!
It is_comma_ somewhat common_comma_ but still_comma_ I am proud of him all the same!
I finished all my finals a couple of months ago for my sophomore year of college.
It really was_comma_ I was scared I would fail but I ended up passing all my classes and even doing well in most of them_comma_ I was over joyed.
Havent had any rain lately in my area. I hope we do soon_comma_ I live near a mountain and we have bad fires when it is dry.
Yes_comma_ It has its drawbacks too_comma_ like making the grass grow_comma_ lol
Yeah_comma_ we have to have it sometimes.
It really irritates me when my friend acts superior to everyone in the room_comma_ since he seems to think he is the best looking and strongest guy ever when really he's not at all.
That wouldn't surprise me. He has always been a bit insecure.
I have always been faithful to my girlfriend_comma_ I am proud of that in a way
That is good and sadly rare these days
i really want to lose weight. i know i can do it
yes_comma_ and i'm very motivated
I was chased by a pitbull as a child_comma_ I was so scared for years afterwards
I was a fast kid so I got away_comma_ but I had heard how hard they bite
Me too_comma_ that would have been brutal
I remember waiting for the Nintendo Switch to come out_comma_ I was so excited
Awesome_comma_ I have Zelda_comma_ Mario_comma_ Splatoon_comma_ Fortnite and tons of other games!
Me neither_comma_ too bad it is far away_comma_ but we still get smash and Pokemon this year!
Hi! Have you been watching the FIFA World Cup recently?
Yes_comma_ I was devastated to learn that because England are my favorite team!
Yes they were doing alright and I was impressed by some of their matches.
I slipped while carrying a tray of coffee at work the other day_comma_ got it all over me.
Yeah_comma_ I was fine. I bit embarrassed_comma_ but fine. Had to go home and change though. It was huge mess.
my parents picked me up from work in a new car for me when I turned 17_comma_ I was so surprised
I was very excited_comma_ just to have a car at all is awesome!
I still my miss my partner_comma_ they left me all alone.
I hope so to_comma_ never thought this would happen_comma_ we were suppose to get a house together.
Thank You_comma_ I hope I will also_comma_ because I deserve it_comma_ and so do you.
When I was in preschool_comma_ my pants fell down in front of everyone
I got laughed at a lot and sat down haha
When I was younger my dad scared me and my brothers so bad I almost peed myself!
When I was younger my dad scared me and my brothers so bad I almost peed myself!
No_comma_ I was too young_comma_ I just about cried though
When I was younger_comma_ my grandmother passed away_comma_ I was so upset
Thank you_comma_ I hope nothing ever happens to them!
There's been a big white wolf or coyote around my yard the past few months. I'm afraid he will kill the neighbors cats. 
I don't know. I had a cute beaver and there was just a head and eyes left of some small animal that looked like him left in my yard. ugh.
thanks
My friend recently invited me to his wedding. I hadn't even known he was engaged_comma_ but it was a great wedding.
Not too big_comma_ maybe 30 guests. He and his now wife have been together for only a year or so_comma_ so they set the whole thing up pretty quickly.
My dad used to be a pretty heavy drinker_comma_ it caused a few problems in our familiy.
Yes he finally stopped drinking a few years ago_comma_ I was very proud of him and was able to have a real relationship with him.
I don't really know how to react to this_comma_ but one of my friends told me a few days ago that not only is he going to Samoa for a while (which didn't surprise me because he and his family go to Africa all the time)_comma_ but he's staying and moving there for a few years.
I think it's because he dropped out of school here and doesn't have much reason to stay in America_comma_ since he can start a new life over there. Kinda makes me sad though_comma_ I didn't expect it at all.
I broke a vase at my mom's house last year_comma_ and ended up hiding the evidence. I still haven't told her_comma_ and I feel bad about it.
It was fairly expensive. She wasn't relly using it for anything_comma_ and hasn't noticed it's gone. I think I'm going to buy a replacement for her_comma_ and let her know I broke the old one.
I meant my DOG got into rat poison and died. It was a truly horrific accident.
He was a little over 8 years old so not long enough!
Yes that's true. Now I am A LOT more careful about where I put rat poison.
No_comma_ and it happened very fast. I started seeing symptoms and he died the next day even after I took him to the vet.
My friend got a huge scholarship when he barely passed the PSAT.
Its mainly an English based test and hes really good at english
Yea he was about 1 point above the cutoff_comma_ I was quite jealous of him to be honest_comma_ I barely didnt make it sadly.
OU_comma_ he ended up dropping out to pursue writing about a year and a half in and wasted the scholarship.
I was pretty strapped for money back before my freshman year of college_comma_ so I really needed to get my 29 on my ACT up to a 31 for a scholarship.
I felt super confident that I'd get the 31_comma_ and thankfully I was right since I got a 33!
My friend stole some of my money the other week.
About $50_comma_ they even confessed and paid me back_comma_ but it was still depressing they didnt just ask first_comma_ I wouldve given him the money.
I was so nervous going to the dentist today_comma_ I thought I would pass out!
I suppose so_comma_ I much needed tooth is repaired now so my anxiety really was for nothing.
So yeah this Log even hit me square in the face and i ran out of the car.
Dude the doctor and my parents thought the same thing.
Nah_comma_ I did have shards of glass on me for a couple of days even after taking showers.
It was really annoying when I was thinking I would room with my brother back in freshman year of college_comma_ but it didn't work out as planned.
Definitely. It was just some random guy_comma_ and he was really incompatible with me too so it was really frustrating that they didn't room us together.
We moved to a new house last year and love it - and have spend much less working on projects and more time with the kids.
Absolutely_comma_ and the time taken to becmoe experts on home repair is rather large.
So i had some anger management issues as a kid. Makes me feel dumb thinking back.
Yeah_comma_ being a lot calmer is nice and well less stress really.
I had my first real drink back in October with some of my friends and I was really nervous about it.
It does_comma_ but I had never tried anything like drugs or alcohol before so I didn't know what to expect.
I can't help but feel bad_comma_ since my friend has met a really good girl for him and I'm happy for him_comma_ but I wish I was in a good relationship too you know?
Exactly_comma_ I am happy for him but I can't help but feel that sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach when I hear about it. Still kinda makes me feel like a bad person.
When I won the honor society president election I was so confident in myself!
I beat someone way more popular_comma_ that is what made it surprising to me
The other day my kids were being bad and I didn't feel well and I yelled at them. I felt guilty afterwards. 
Yes_comma_ but there are other ways to discipline them then yelling. I hurt their feelings.
That is true_comma_ especially when I'm not feeling well.
My parents bought me a car when i turned 17_comma_ i was so surprised
I still own it actually_comma_ still running!
I was shocked when I got a new car. My parents surprised me so well
my birthday!
One time I was at this party and a girl started to get really touchy feely and flirting with me_comma_ but I had a girlfriend at the time.
I was way too close to my girlfriend to do anything_comma_ so I just let her know that I was in a relationship so that she wouldn't get the wrong idea.
So_comma_ I asked my 7 year old what 12x12 was the other day_comma_ and he gave me the correct answer without hesitation.
Thanks_comma_ I'm really proud of him. We homeschool so I guess I'm doing something right!
Man the first ever console i owned personally was a gamecube. Was so surprised getting it was funny what my parents did.
I didn't get Mario until late was Sonic adventures 2_comma_ Parents hid the console in the bathroom with the game and told me to go clean the bathroom.
I still remember my high school days_comma_ I was a terrific athlete during that time.
The runner's marathon. I felt so proud when I came in second place because I had trained for many months for it!
My brother graduated high school_comma_ I was proud of him
2017_comma_ I was there_comma_ it was awesome!
A month or two ago my girlfriend randomly broke up with me and I had no idea that she was even close to considering that.
It wasn't a great time_comma_ but it just really irked me since I had no idea that she was not into me at that time. She must've been really good at faking it.
I reconnected with one of my childhood friends and I even got to go to the house that we used to hang out in years and years ago.
You should_comma_ especially if you truly miss any of your childhood friends. It was a surreal but amazing experience.
My grandmother passed away when I was a child_comma_ it really upset me
I am happy for you_comma_ I hope that continues
I have a girlfriend_comma_ and I will never cheat on her
Absolutely_comma_ not even a doubt
So i am really happy with myself lately. Finally graduated college after 8 years since 2009.
Yeah it felt tough every year that passed but i got that degree man.
I have a girlfriend_comma_ and I would never cheat on her
I agree_comma_ I am not sure how people can do that to each other
My sister is coming from France to visit us. I am happy to see her again.
No_comma_ I am not. It is exciting. It has been almost a year since I saw her.
I started working out again and it was nerveracking to begin again.
It's been over 10 years since i've worked out!
yes i did and i have slowly gotten back into it.
This morning I was running late for work_comma_ and I got so mad at the driver in front of me!
No_comma_ but I do hate those_comma_ too! We were in bumper to bumper traffic_comma_ and this woman is putting on her makeup.  She doesn't notice when the car in front of her moves_comma_ and we miss the light. Ugh!
LOL! Not my place to judge.  I was so hopping mad about having to sit through that stupid light again. 
It made me feel really disappointed when my CV got rejected in the first place.

A few years ago_comma_ I was out hiking_comma_ and almost stepped on a rattlesnake. Thank goodness it alerted!
It took me a minute to figure out what I was hearing_comma_ and then I back up VERY quickly!!
It stayed put. My friend and I had to backtrack_comma_ and cut through some heavy brush to get around it_comma_ because the trail was too narrow to walk past it on. 
My last trip to the beach was amazing! I felt confident enough to wear a bikini!

I am so annoyed that France is in the world cup final. I do not like their style of play
They are to defensive.Their games are so boring.
I am so surprised Roger Federer lost yesterday at Wimbledon. he is the GOAT of tennis.
He is the best player ever.He won the mos grand slams titles.
When my wife and I got married_comma_ we knew we wanted to have kids.  When we found out that we were expecting_comma_ the only thing on our mind for the longest time was if we were having a boy or a girl.
We did! We were living in Japan at the time_comma_ and we were paying this clinic 2000 yen a week so we could keep getting ultrasounds of the baby.
At the time_comma_ the exchange rate was about 110 yen to the dollar_comma_ so it was pretty affordable_comma_ and worth it to keep going back.
I wouldn't be able to tell you_comma_ since I wasn't under their healthcare system.  This was just a women's clinic that offered this service pretty cheaply.
I'm so happy and relieved my mom came to my rescue this week.
She offered to help me out financially with something that was really stressing me out.
I fell off the back porch steps and broke my wrist. It required surgery.

He just took his lunch box_comma_ have a last look at me and said : I hope they will be nice.
Not sad at all. He was so happy_comma_ but of course a little bit anxious.
That's terrible! I suppose sometimes things backfire_comma_ no matter how good our intentions are.
They tried to make out I was bad at my job_comma_ that's the last time I'll give somebody a heads up at my own expense again.
I sure did_comma_ thankfully I've been there a lot longer so they know me well enough.
It did_comma_ but it could have ended very badly for me or even have resulted in me losing my job.
I lost my best friend last year when he moved to Chicago because he got accepted into a master's program_comma_ and he made me feel like our friendship meant nothing since he was going on to do bigger and better things. 
We don't really stay in touch anymore. He and his fiance invited me to their wedding_comma_ though. He's not a social media person_comma_ and I'm not either_comma_ so we've basically lost touch. I haven't filled the void_comma_ unfortunately_comma_ but I feel okay about it now. 
Maybe it will. I'm not sure_comma_ but I feel more happy for him now than I do envious and hurt. So_comma_ whatever happens_comma_ happens. It's okay.

I went back though my old high school as part of a reunion.  It brought back many memories.

It was a hot summer day and the sirens went off in the grocery store. I was about to leave the grocery store until the lady next to me with 2 kids stopped me to ask if I can assist her. I carried one of her kids out of the grocery store. It seemed that she felt comfortable around me.

It's a small 3 bedroom home_comma_ 1 level. It's just me and my elderly mom.
There is something wrong with my sister in law.  She refuses to take her kids to the doctor for checkups or even when they are sick.
That's what my husband and I think.  I mean even when they were babies and would run 103 fever_comma_ she wouldn't take them.  I just do not understand that at all - they are both grown now but she's pretty uninvolved with either of them.

Slipped on a wet floor while hurrying to get to a patient. There was no sign.

Back in the 2014 World Cup I was super excited when Argentina won against the Netherlands in the semi-final. It was crazy!
I used to when I was a kid but not since then! But I have to follow it_comma_ I was born in Argentina_comma_ it's in my blood
It really is! And the food is amazing
Might sell my home. It's the home I grew up in.

Just got offered a car as a gift. I really needed it.
It is! The person is very kind to have reached out like that.
My mother in law always lies and exaggerates things.  Sometimes the same story is told two different ways to both my husband and I.
It's frustrating though_comma_ never knowing how she's going to interpret something and then share it with others.  Some of the things she's told our kids have been just horrible.
My wife is at the hospital getting checked right now. I think we might be getting good news about a new addition to the family.
Thank you so much. I can't wait to get the good news from her. 
My brother got suspended for something he did not do in high school by a very vindictive teacher.

My dogs passed away 2 years ago. My family adopted me one this past weekend on my birthday.
Thank you. She's a jack russel and very spunky!
I took the last cream soda from a pack that belonged to my buddy from the fridge when I was drunk. Didn't think it was a big deal until he told me he drove 5 hours just to get them and they were expensive. I felt kind of bad so I bought him a happy meal 
Yes
"I haven't heard from my friend in 3 days. His family doesn't know where he is.

I missed my friends wedding because I was hungover_comma_ it was stupid and I still feel bad about it.
10 years or so_comma_ its still a sore subject for them
My neighbor's home burned down. There was an outpour of support from the community.
Defintely. They cried_comma_ because they weren't expecting the support.
There was recently a sale at one of my favorite local restaurants. I have no working vehicle so I couldn't go but a friend came and took me to catch the sale.
Yea it was very enjoyable for me because the place rarely has sales. I was also very thankful to my friend because I didn't expect to go.
Over 10 years_comma_ I've known him since lower grade levels in school.
Can't wait for the local band competition this weekend.
All kinds! I love getting to hear some new bands.

Yes_comma_ they do.  He will be about 200 miles away so not too far away.  He is very excited.
Finally got a raise after busting my butt off for 5 years.
No. I would be afraid to.
I let a friend copy my answers for a test she did not study for and she made an A.
It still bothers me to this day.
My oldest daughter had a hard time with other kids in school.
Yes_comma_ they can.  But I blame the parents also_comma_ these kids bullied her to the point that I had to have her removed from that class - the principles wouldn't even do anything.
I get a good feeling when I think back to a birthday I had when I was a kid and all of my friends and I got to see a really funny movie at the mall.
Ace ventura_comma_ it was awhile back obviously
We really did
So i was at school and ruined my pants with milk
I think everyone did but I ran to the bathroom real quick to hide it.
Yeah same but im over it now
I couldn't sleep with the lights on after watching "The Sixth Sense" the first time.  When I closed my eyes I would see the poisoned girl staring at me angrily with vomit running down her mouth_comma_ with the abused lady behind her yelling..."YOU CAN'T HURT ME ANYMORE NEDDY!!!"".
No I just soiled my pantssss omg
Job interviews are hard for me because I get so nervous beforehand.
Right! It is everything leading up to it that is the worst. The interview itself is never so bad.
Yes. Maybe I need to find a way to distract myself.
My mother was saving a piece of cake for my dad and I accidentally ate it.
Well she got a bit mad at first_comma_ but I told her I'd buy him something in return and it all worked out.
I was told to come back the next day after waiting over an hour in line to get my drivers license renewed.
Yes_comma_ it is. Would have been a lot easier if I could have done it online.
I recently got a $1_comma_000 scholarship that I even forgot I applied for last year.
I was! It really came at the right time.
My first dog_comma_ Tank_comma_ I got as a pitbull. He was with us 5 years. I loved that dog sooo much. After a family emergency came up we had to move. We couldn't take Tank so I had to let him go.
I got him as a puppy at 7 weeks old. A man that owned a farm offered to take him. As I drove off I looked in my rear view and saw him chasing the car. I cried like a baby all the way down that driveway.
I hope so too... He was so protective over me. I miss him very much. lol He made me go from a cat lover to a dog lover.
Just went by the lake. Made me think of a friend I used to play with a lot when we were little.
It's a lake near my grandparent's home in TN. I had a lot of fun!
I had to get my license renewed and I had to wait over an hour at the DMV.
I actually did not. I didn't get to charge my phone the night before_comma_ so while I was waiting_comma_ it died. 
Just heard back from my boss about a promotion. He says it sounds good that I would get it.
I work in marketing. It's kinda cut throat sometimes.
I'm going to be really upset if I get passed over for another promotion. I've paid my dues.
Yeah_comma_ but nothing seems to change. After you talk to them things go back to normal and other people get rewarded.
I recently had an existential crisis. It was awful
I watched the new Avengers movie and a lot of people die. And I realized we're all going to die and there's no way to know what that's like. And then I felt sick for a couple days and couldn't stop thinking about it
Yea. I don't know why_comma_ it was the dumbest thing. I was really upset.

I miss my father.
He died 5 years ago.He left a whole on me.
I've been at home homeschooling my girls for many years_comma_ but that time is coming to an end very quickly.
My youngest was in a ballet company and public school just did not work for her.  My oldest stayed in public school for awhile and then made the decision to come home in 8th grade.  It's been a good decision for us_comma_ but it's really time for me to get back into the work force.
I am not going to return to work after my maternity leave.
I have decided to stay home with my daughter.
My friend just told me she likes me as more than a friend.
I don't know. We've been friends for so long.
I am so jealous of my friend Eric
He just started dating the most amazing woman i have ever seem. I want her.
No.He did no steal her form me. I only met her after he started dating her.
My boyfriend always does thing thing that gets me so jealous.
It's not that! The thing he does is sometimes_comma_ he'll go get food without me and it's usually the last good thing to eat!
I have but sometimes he forgets. He tends to be a scatterbrain-boy.
I got the promotion letter when I least expected it
I WS promoted to the sales manager 
In an insurance company with a good pay check
When I was a young girl_comma_ and mother of a two year old_comma_ my own mom passed away. This was a very sad time for me as I'm an only child and my father wasn't around either.
Oh yea it was.  It still bothers me. Nobody should go through that by themselves. 
Being a bit teary-eyed tonight realizing how grown my children are.
In no time at all_comma_ they will be out of our house completely.  I guess I'll have to get a dog_comma_ I'll be one of those ladies that has a dog stroller and takes the dog to grocery shop!
The mummies at my local art museum are amazing! One that I saw was from the Roman Era.
Right. I had no idea their usage stretched such a long time period.
Their display were pretty neat.
One time I ate the rest of my friends leftover food after going out and thought he didn't want it.
He was quite mad and upset_comma_ I felt horrible afterwards but he forgave me.
Yes I wanted to help both of us since i felt bad and so did he.
When a storm came through my town a few springs ago_comma_ I felt prepared. I knew when to leave and where to go.
I just drove to the town over with my animals_comma_ that town did not get a drop of rain.

I am so exited about Sunday.
The world cup finals_comma_ the most important event in the planet.
I want Croatia to win because they are the underdogs.

I'm going to Disney World with my family for the first time!
I can't wait_comma_ everyone says it is the most magical place on Earth!
Dealing with the passing of my mother-in-law was hard. My wife really struggled_comma_ I hope I did enough for her.
Thank you. It was just a couple of weeks ago. Still hurting here.
During the day today_comma_ I was in an Uber when it crashed. I'm just thankful no one was hurt!
It was both drivers faults. They should have both paid attention. It could have been worse though.
I really really love the snow_comma_ but we never get it.  Well a few years ago_comma_ my wish was granted!
Georgia - it snowed alright_comma_ and no one expected it to stick - well_comma_ it did and so many people were stranded.  My husband went to pick up our daughter from school and it took him 6 hours to get there and back.  The school is 5 miles from our house.
How was work for you today?  It was long for me.  I got blamed for a report that had bad figures in it.  But I didn't provide those figures or type the report!
That sounds fun.  Where are you going?
Nice!  Which ones will you be going to?  I've been to Yosemite and Sequoia.  Both are awesome.
I was so happy when my parents got me a dog for Christmas!
It was a chocolate lab. I didn't care what kind of dog I got. I had always wanted one!
I can't believe my friend ruined Sons of Anarchy for me...I was only on season 2 and she told me about how they all die at the end I was sad and horrified
Yeah tell me about...never gonna watch Netflix with her again haha
I was very sick one day and we had to go to the local ER.
Well_comma_ they are pretty inept at this local ER.  I was so nauseous and all I remember is the nurses talking about their divorces and no one doing anything to help me.  Even the dr. acted like I was a bother.
I was really scared when a tornado came down a few hundred feet from my house.
Yeah_comma_ there is really nothing you can do about it I guess.
Yeah_comma_ we had something similar
I really like that I can be with my daughter during the day and not worry about her under someone else care.
It great and I don't have to worry about the house chores being done since I am the one who does it all.
yes! I hear you house work is my life. Being a mom is amazing though!
A couple years back a stranger tried to take my phone.
No I just secured my phone and walked off_comma_ I was supper annoyed.
Guest what? It was a Ferrari...!!!
I said guess what! A custom made Ferrari with luxurious taste 
Every year I'm so excited about Christmas and have all these plans.
I've seen that also_comma_ but I'm not sure.  I'm just talking regular Christmas in December LOL!  But it always seems that time slips away from me and all the traditions I want to do with my kids don't get completed.
I got lucky and passed my course this semester
Computer Science. There was a 3 point curve on the final that really helped me out this time.
I can't wait for February
I am going on my first cruise with my family.
I can't wait! It is going to be a great time.
My sister in law should have never had children.  Yet she was able to get pregnant right away.
No_comma_ she just doesn't care for them.  They are an accessory to her.  It took us 4 years to get pg. and my children are well taken care of
I tripped the other day on a stair becuase one was slightly higher than the others.
Yea im fine but it was quite an embarrasing and frustrating situation.
I was in a bad spot when my mom passed away randomly a few years ago
She just passed away in her sleep. She was not in the best health.
Thank you_comma_ its better now than it was.
Last week I was so upset when my dog jumped up on the table and started eating my child's birthday cake! I really yelled at the mutt!
I can't blame him for making a move like that. I thought he was outside at the moment. Well_comma_ we were able to salvage enough for the party!
My husband and I finally found the camper of our dreams after about a year of wanting one and we finally have our first camping trip planned!
Not near as much as we thought because we got an awesome deal!
When I got accepted to my university of choice_comma_ my family and I took a trip there. It was a fun experience
Yes it was. I was ecstatic to go on a plane.
Man_comma_ last week I almost got into a crash because someone almost hit me.
Yep and they ran a redlight_comma_ I was super ticked off_comma_ was on my way to work.
It is hard to express how I felt when my kids were born. It was as if my heart grew 3 sizes that day!
It's not for everyone. I really respect people that give real thought to the decision. It is a life-changing commitment.
We made the decision to homeschool our girls years ago.
One of them is in a ballet company and regular school hours were hard to do and if we allowed it for one_comma_ we needed to allow it for the other.  I've graduated one and the other is close behind_comma_ but I still feel nervous about all of it.
The street I was on had the buildings right next to the sidewalk and the cat has fallen out of it's window.
It wasn't mine. I had no idea who's it was. It wasn't hurt though_comma_ it sprinted away as soon as it landed.
The night WS the longest to me back then_comma_eager to know my score!
Sure_comma_I put in my best ! I was positive!
A friend lied to me about why he did not come to my moms funeral. It was stupid at the time but I am still upset about it.

Trump embarrass me a lot.
He is a clown that got elected president.
I have a difficult falling asleep before a job interview
Yes_comma_ that happens because I am so nervous about being in a new environment.
I am very happy lately.
I get to see my kids next weekend.
I am faithful to my wife_comma_ but it's thought.
My problem is a co-worker of mine.She is gorgeous and very flirting.
I feel terrible about not listening to my child's complaints about being picked on. What was I thinking?
He is 13 and now he doesn't want to go to school any more. Bullying is such a terrible thing. I now listen to everything he tells me.
I never knew what to expect at these bachelorette parties...as a male stripper I always expected some lonely old cat ladies looking for company...but almost every single time they turned out to be gorgeous chicks in their 20s
Yes it was all tips haha..fun times :)
I will never forget the day I became a father. It was such an amazing experience.
You can relate! When I first heard my daughter's cry my heart instantly melted. She is almost 10 now but she will always be daddy's little girl!
Turns out it was a deer who got stuck in the bushes.
Haven't the slightest clue. It was a baby so maybe it was following it's mother through and didn't have the force needed to get out.
So my parents bought a new puppy for my younger brother. He had no idea it was coming and was so happy and excited!
I think he nearly did! It was so sweet. Do you have any pets?
Oh_comma_ how scary. I love that name though. Very unique!
His name is Louie. I thought it was pretty cute
I had a motor accident_comma_ they were really helpful indeed
You graduate this year? Congrats
I am very confident on the French Team.
No_comma_ the soccer world cup finals next Sunday.
A bad storm was coming in just as I was leaving for the airport so I brought extra snacks in case I got delayed.
Yea_comma_ it wasn't as bad as it could have been though. The delay was only about half an hour.
Gosh it is already 11:30pm and my kids are still awake!
It stays bright so late nowadays that it's impossible to get them to go to bed. 
My sister and I lived close to each other then I moved an hour away.
It's hard. We have kids that are the same age too. But we maker it work
No joke! So many conveniences.
I am an ESL teacher and one of my 3 year old students came to school singing an entire song all about the planets. It was so cute!
Yeah_comma_ it was a really special moment for me. Little kids that age are so cute!
Haha_comma_ I know that argument well. I teach some preschool/pre-k kids and they can definitely be a handful!
My girlfriend decided to jump out and scare me one day. I was so mad and embarrassed that I flinched.
Not high_comma_ but towards me. She popped up from her hiding spot.
My wife left me and i am so lonely.
No.I am very depressed and suicidal.
I ma very proud of my son
he is 18 and got accepted at MIT. 
I was really nervous when starting a new job a few months ago..
True. I think it's best just to push through it_comma_ and get it out of the way
Good_comma_ enjoying it!
This year is absolutely flying by!
Yes! It's already like time to do school shopping for "Fall 2018". Crazy.
Yes for sure. Waiting for Christmas as a child was like FOREVER and now as soon as Christmas ends it feels like we are shopping for the next one within a millisecond lol. 
Hey_comma_ I used to fill lonely in college - my senior year. I was studying all of the time and single.
Yes_comma_ that was some time ago. I'm mostly too busy to fill lonely_comma_ and around people a lot.
Yes_comma_ so what are the things on your schedule typically?
I had an awful time getting gas today at 7/11 because of someone there.
Almost..I should have. This guy just kept gawking at my rear and making comments. It's so uncomfortable.
Yeah_comma_ except this art was wearing baggy sweat pants today. 
I suppose you do have a point there.
My sister made some toast and left it on the counter. So I ate it and inferred the dog must have taken it when she asked.
No. My dog eats any food available to her so it's pretty believable.
That must have been terrifying.
Sorry I was thinking aloud of the moment when I was mortified. When I was in elementary school my skirt ripped in front of the whole class and my teacher didn't want to help me!
Oh I am most definitely glad of that. I remember that day so vividly_comma_ I was crying!
My family disowned me a few years ago. I heard that they were going on the annual family lake trip next week. Thinking about it made me really sad as I remembered all of my childhood memories on this trip.
I don't know_comma_ I have been waiting five years and have sent many emails to my mom  but she seems too angry. I hope so one day but it seems less likely every day. 
I ran away from home with boyfriend_comma_ when I was 16_comma_ and we had a baby. I don't regret it because we are married now and have three sons. (: I appreciate you asking_comma_ thanks.
Thank you so much! I should end the chat now haha but I just wanted to thank you_comma_ so if you want you can end it.
I was about to eat _comma_opened the pack and it was a pizza _comma_you could have imagined!
It was not a question of like_comma_but what I ordered.That was a careless service I must say
Yeah_comma_I heart beat increased_comma_I blood rose..it was like I should ..uhmmnn. You can guess !
I just saw a naked man run through my neighborhood. It was so weird.
Not even close. I can't believe someone would do that.
My daughter's dentist appointment went so great today!
She was totally afraid and had to be put to sleep to have dental work done and now she was just great and let them clean them without any issues. It was a relief.
I am furious at Donald Trump
Because the way he separated all those children from their parents.
Do you ever get those moments where you wonder where life would be if you did one thing differently? Like for me_comma_ I always feel embarrassed to think if I hadn't gone to college_comma_ maybe my life would be easier?...
I suppose that's true. I feel like sometimes my family may view me as a disgrace for not doing much with my life.
That is true. i have to think of that more often.
Ugh I am so sick of working overnight shifts_comma_ but I am nervous to start something new.
That's definitely true_comma_ I just worry that the grass is always greener on the other side.
Going to Disney makes me so happy
I have an annual pass to the parks and I just love to go on the rides! Meeting the characters is a plus as well!
Growing up  _comma_I had prospects_comma_would I be rich _comma_or would I be poor _comma_lingered on my mind..Lol!
Yeah ! Work hard _comma_pray hard I suppose?
Yesterday_comma_ I submitted my application for a credit card with Chase. Thankfully_comma_ I was approved and was really glad
Indeed. It was my fifth credit card that I have now among others
Moving to a new age bracket is scary.
Turning 40 is one step closer to being older and makes me think about old age more.
Back in 2013 I won an NCAA bracket challenge online through a local restaurant. The payout was $1_comma_000 cash. I was really excited...felt great.
That's awesome_comma_ I haven't played fantasy sports for a few years......the dudes I used to play with have moved on and unfortunately one guy_comma_ one of my best friends died of cancer.....it sucked.
I appreciate that.
My niece just turned two and it's weird reading her the books I read as a kid.
It's weird having some things that you haven't thought about in decades come rushing back.
One of my fondest memories was when I went on an airplane for the first time as a child.
I LOVE window seats! As a kid I always made sure to get one and now as an adult I do the same. I love to travel!
I trust my wife_comma_ i think.
She may be cheating on me.
I am very sad these days
No. i am sad because of president Trump.
I have a presentation to prepare for this week and I am finding it really hard to meet the deadline. I am so stressed
I know_comma_ but somehow the crippling anxiety is filling me from inside and I can't stay calm most of the time
So I think we are all going to see the cousins new boat this weekend!
We are supposed to get some showers in the morning but thats it
So last night I snuck into the kitchen at my cousins house.
Well I just drank all his beer...
I feel bad so I need to replace it in the morning.
WIsh that did happen to you_comma_ better luck next time.
Me too_comma_ sometimes I think it's karma. Maybe all the bad things that I did are coming back to me.
I ordered a package over a month ago and it finally arrived.
Sunglasses. They were back ordered and didn't arrive in time for my trip to the beach.
It is so wonderful to just relax at home on the couch with my family after a long day.
Yes it is wonderful. It is like complete peace and harmony. There is nothing better!
When my Grandmother passed away_comma_ it was really hard for me.
I was really worried about my Grandfather_comma_ but I think he has finally accepted her death and moved on.
Sometimes I reflect upon my life_comma_ and at this current moment I am happy with where I am.
I agree. At times life may seem uncertain but I know for a fact that I am on the right path to success.
I was very impressed with the food today at Outback restaurant. Everything was delicious.
Steak is my favorite too. The bloomin onion is also a great appetizer.
I am very devastated these days.
My father day 3 weeks ago.I still can't believe.
It is so hard to cope with loneliness. Especially after my break up
For about 3 years since college. Loneliness is the worst that could happen to a human being
Once I was robbed at gun point and locked in a walk in refrigerator for an hour.
Yes.. Cold and terrifying!  We had an alarm button in there to push but it was broken and no one came to save us for a long time.
Very Cold LOL.  Cold and scary.
Yeah it happened when I was working at a Pizza hut.  After that I went back to school so I didn't have to work in such places anymore.
I can't wait for next Sunday
Yes_comma_ the world cup final between France and Croatia 
My van did a really good job on a pretty long_comma_ 5 hour trip lately. I was doubting it'll make it because I've had problems with it for a while.
Yeah I felt so relieved and kind of shocked after I got to my destination.
I recently had the chance to betray a friend of mine_comma_ but instead I stayed faithful. 
We can all hope. I think most people would've acted the same way. 
It was a tough day at work
My boss kept criticizing my work. He kept bugging on me to an unbearable point.
If I work hard In it_comma_I'll achieve it!
Sure ! I know I can!
I knocked my favorite glass off the table and now I have to find a replacement.
No_comma_ it was a fairly clean cut down the middle. Not shattered or anything.
It is so crazy to me. My best friend and her husband have an open marriage and I just cannot fathom having another partner other than my husband.
I know it. They both apparently just don't mind it. Makes me wonder if they are really in love or just kind of creatures of comfort.
I almost got into a wreck today because someone cute me off on my way to work.
Yea it did. I was so frustrated that someone could be so careless.
Homeless people are very unfortunate. It breaks my heart seeing them living in desperation
I hope I could help somehow_comma_ but I am short on my financial situation too
I am very apprehensive nowadays_comma_
Yes.I just got interviewed for the job of my dreams and now i am waiting for an answer.
Last week I had to put my dog to sleep.  It was really sad because I had him for 16 years.
Ugh that happened to me before as well with another dog.  Her name was Doodles.
Yeah.  She had diabetes and we had to give her insulin.  And she was blind for 4 years so I guess it was time.
I am so disappointed on my son.
He decided to quit College and join a band.
I sometimes wish I could go back to high school and be a kid again.
I am sorry to hear that. I think we all had struggles we went through as kids_comma_
Talent shows in high school and Pep rallies_comma_ getting out of class. Just the memories I made with friends I don't get to see now.
I have been looking for a job for months_comma_ going on interview after interview and I finally went on one that I am really interested in but I have been waiting all week to find out if I got it or not.
Its a teaching job.  I didn't call but I did email the guy and touch base with him.  But he didn't reply :(
Thank you so much!  I really appreciate that!  I feel like I've been waiting forever!
I got a toy for my niece's birthday in the mail and figured I could put it together without any directions.
Oh yea. But it took way longer than anticipated. I eventually had to swallow my pride and dig through the trash for the instructions.
I miss my mother deeply.
yes_comma_ very much.She was the most important person in my life.
My family just left on a trip for a week and I had to stay back to work. 
They'll be gone for 7 days and 6 nights!
That's so true! I think they will have fun but I will miss them being all alone in the house. 
thanks!
The other night my grandma wanted to video chat to say hi to her great grand kids. My four year old was showing off his counting skills and some other cute stuff he had learned. It made my grandma really happy.
Oh yeah it's great for her to have a change to see what the kids are up to. But video calling can be really glitchy and awkward too haha.
Not too bad_comma_ but she didn't really notice sometimes that she wasn't hearing certain words correctly. I just went with it haha.
Can't wait for summer time to come
Well  that's cool_comma_talking from the past ...Lol!
I can't wait for next Sunday
You know it.Just the biggest game in 4 years.
I have been working so hard and it seems my payment can no longer take care of my bills 
I am about to lose it_comma_ but i will talk to my boss about it
It was pretty shocking for me to learn that I have failed my Calculus exam when I had studied so hard for it
Only next semester. I feel like I have wasted much of my time
I have been going on interviews for 4 months and today I finally got a job!  I am so happy!
I am going to be a teacher at a high school for kids who have dropped out and went back to finish.
Thank you!  I am very excited about it and glad I don't have to keep looking and looking and looking for a job!
On mother's day my kids and I had a nice relaxing morning just cuddling in bed. My spouse made breakfast in bed and we all just hung out together. It made me feel so peaceful and happy.
Oh thank you that's a nice thing to say! 
I felt terrible when I realized I had accidentally run over my neighbor's garden. Oops!
No_comma_ I never did which made me feel even worse. I ended up sending an anonymous letter with some cash in it. I didn't want her to be mad at me.
A light switch in my house stopped working and I was able to fix it without looking up how.
Thanks. It wasn't too messed up though. A wire just needed to be reconnected.
Got to work and ...Boom! It was my birthday 
A blast that last! I suppose? I love rhymes.. Lol!
I am having a job interview tomorrow and it is my first interview ever 
Oh yeah i was. I have read a lot of books about this and yet it will not help
I buy a lottery ticket every day but for some reason I have not won more than $10. My luck will soon change!
No_comma_ I am pretty sure I will be one of the lucky ones who hits the jackpot. It's not gambling if it is a sure thing!
I am so sad lately.  My husband needs a lung transplant and he is only 40 years old.
It has been happening gradually over a number of years he has a genetic form of COPD and has never smoked or done anything to deserve this.
He just got put on the list for the transplant so now he has to wait until its his time.
Thank you so much! I appreciate your prayers!
My first cat disaapeared 2 years ago after 14 years with him
Yea they like to leave when they are dying to try and heal but it is very depressing when they are just gone
One time in welding school I got 2 of my teachers a gig with a major contractor on FT Benning building ADA code railing for th new hospital and centers and stuff_comma_
It was pretty awesome_comma_ I showed up in school after they had gotten paid and he was getting out his wallet. He said he had something for me but it felt better telling him I didn't need it they hired me on full time.
Definitely_comma_ I got to travel the country spending bunches of money lol_comma_ good times
I made some cookies from scratch and left to run an errand. When I came back my family had eaten most of them without asking.
I hid the rest of them away so only I get to eat the rest.
i think my performance is way better than the winner's perfromance 
I am just saying what I feel. I put all my best into this and yet I lost to a poor performer  
I was in the park the other day and dropped some money on the ground without knowing it. A kind stranger witnessed this happen and picked up the money. That person then returned it to me.
Yes_comma_ it is nice when communities watch out for each other.
Yes I am glad too. I rewarded the person by giving them what I had dropped since they appeared to need it more than me.
Thank you for listening.
My boyfriend and I celebrated our sixth anniversary the other week. I was pretty sure he was planning to propose because of the nice plans he had made- and he was. For a couple of days leading up to it I was so excited and just could hardly wait. 
I was_comma_ even though I was a bit just antsy to find out if I was even right. I was really happy!
Yep he did_comma_ he is my fiance now! Thank you. (:
I am really nervous.  I have to go tomorrow to get my tooth pulled and I am scared to death.  I hate the dentist!
Not really_comma_ but I want to have it done before something bad like that happens.
So about 2 or 3 months ago I found out the Dallas Cowboys were letting Dez Bryant go and he's a free agent.  It's disappointing to me because I'm a Cowboys fan and I like him as part of the team.  Have you heard of Dez Bryant
I agree Emmett Smith is an awesome runningback.  Dez Bryant just ran his mouth too much and was too emotional.  It's a shame and he's still unemployed.  How upsetting.  Troy Aikman was a great quarterback and a great commentator.
I agree they were some good games between the fills and cowboys.
I experienced road rage the other day. I woman carelessly swerved in front of me_comma_ causing me to slam on my brakes.
Yeah_comma_ and then when I finally got around her I saw she was yakking on her cell phone_comma_ completely oblivious to the world around her. So annoying!
When my mom got sick i feel sick too. I cannot handle it
I called my brother and shared the news with him but yet i wish i can be there to care for her
Man_comma_ one time I got wayyy too drunk and it was not a good time.
It was one of the first times I drank and I felt awful and thought I was basically gonna die.
What did you do to make it better?
Yeah_comma_ one time I had a big fight with my mom. But when I realized I was wrong I went to talk to her to make it up.
Something stupid_comma_ and yeah it ended well with hugs all around haha. 
it was just yesterday when i was going for an interview and personally i was so afraid because i did not know what were the end results
actually i woke up early in the morning and prepared my self fully for the task ahead of me
i just received a call that i did good in my interview and i qualified to work with them. this made me so happy
Everytime I see my cat vomit on the floor it makes me sick to my stomach.
Yea I hate having to pick it up afterwards
I need someone to date so badly. I cannot hold it anymore
What do you think i can do about it. I need some help
My aunt is coming to visit soon. I'm ridiculously excited because she always makes this desert I love.
Lemon squares. It's basically shortbread with lemon meringue on top.
Ever had a time where you really needed a certain grade on a final to keep your letter grade? I did that in calculus last semester.
Exactly! I didn't even do well enough to keep my A but he gave it to me anyway haha.
I was super shocked when I did well on my math final_comma_ thought i bombed it hard
I got a 50ish which was like a C in my class and easily passed_comma_ was super happy and shocked
I was in 5th grade and wanted a remote control car. My older brother who had a job said he would buy it for me if I got all A's on next report card. My lowest score was A- and he said that A- is not an A.
Yes I thought so too. That's when I learned about life being full of loopholes.
The answer is yes to both.
I was mad I didn't get the job I had applied and interviewed for. I put so much work in crafting my resume to fit the description.
I did appreciate getting the experience of interviewing at the company. But I was even more upset when I found out the job went to a recent college graduate with no experience!
Do you know the feeling of having a vacation after long working months
I will be going on a cruise for the vacation
I am so mad!  All my boyfriend does is play video games 24/7!
Yes_comma_ but he doesn't care.  He only cares about his game life!
Me and my four year old were grocery shopping. He was saying all sorts of cute things to people and being very polite. People were really amused by him it seemed. 
I will for sure! Kids are the best_comma_ are you a parent or planning on being one ever?
I do not know if it is stupid to do but i handed my things to a stranger to look out for it
I just feel like he is the next person available and i asked for his help
My experience is too much happier when i am surprise
yes
I am worried about my surgery next week. I have never had to get surgery before!
Yeah_comma_ I will be under as well but I am still concerned something will go wrong. I think I watch too many scary movies!
Whenever I started in college_comma_ I really wanted to get my foot in the door with girls so I decided to download Tinder and it worked out surprisingly well.
I've found a few with quite mixed levels of success. I have gotten a fair amount of matches though.
I spent months practicing for a major symphony in New York. All that hard work really paid off.
I was granted a position in the symphony on trumpet!
I am going for a competition tomorrow. I will surely be the winner 
It is  a singing competition. It was going to be fun how i will become the winner 
I am really excited.  I am going on vacation next week and I haven't been on one in awhile.
I am going to Clearwater Beach on the Gulf of Mexico.  
I was over the moon when I passed my classes last semester.
Physics_comma_ calc_comma_ and other normal filler courses or engineering classes
As bad as it is to say_comma_ one time I took a flash drive that I saw in a computer that I used at school because I needed one and it had nothing on it.
I know man_comma_ thanks for being so supportive of my otherwise questionable decision!
I am announced the best writer in my state for the third time 
Well. Let us just say i am good at what i do and i feel so good about it
Whenever I see a newborn baby I always think about how I wish their life will be happy and long.
Yes those laughing babies will always bring you a smile.
That is true. I enjoy my nephews for a few hours and then I go home.
I recently got to visit California for the first time. It's a pretty incredible place.
The weather. It's the same temperature and humidity everyday. Makes packing easy.
Oh yea. Just above 70 with a light breeze.
A month ago I had to move out of my house with only 2 weeks notice.
It was very hectic and I was very stressed. I had a lot_comma_ but most of it had to be left behind when I moved in with my friend.
I worked very hard on my part on the assigned project and my supervisor praised me yesterday in front of others in the meeting
Indeed. I felt very appreciated for the work I did and was truly grateful
I am such a sugar addict. I ate most of my kids' Halloween candies. I blamed it on their friends instead.
Well they were upset but I let them pick some more candies out at the store. It was wrong of me to eat their candies.
I cant wait for next weekend.  I am going to Disney World here in Florida.
Yes it is.  I live in Orlando_comma_ but rarely go to the attractions so its long overdue.
I left the light on in my car the other day and it killed the battery
Yea it makes me want to just walk back inside and go back to sleep and ignore everything
I recently interviewed a job_comma_ but then the company threw a wrench in my plans.
They decided to cancel the position outright. They didn't hire anyone!
I'm not too excited to go back to college_comma_ but the living facility that I'm living in this year is much_comma_ much better.
Well the freshman dorms are old and small_comma_ whereas the one that I'm living in this year is brand new and closer to an apartment.
How believable do you think this is when you run into your old school mate outside the country 
Of course yes_comma_ that is what i just said happened to me. It really caught me unaware 
My boyfriend and I went to the beach the other evening to celebrate our six year anniversary. It was secluded and looked gorgeous. He proposed to me and I was soooo elated. 
We met in high school when he moved in with a friend that was my neighbor. We became friends just goofing around on the bus and then we got jobs at a neighborhood diner together and messaging each other every night and then eventually we just started spending every single evening with each other since. 
No not at all_comma_ I feel so so lucky that I met him so young. I've grown up so much and become such a better person because he motivates me to do so_comma_ and I am so lucky to get every year I can to spend with him. 
Thank you very much_comma_ I'm wishing/praying the best for you too. 
How can people be stupid enough to step on your toes without apologizing 
I feel like punching him in the face. He was so rude and stupid 
Man_comma_ my friend has it so good in some regards. I have never been able to afford a car and he has had three free cars already.
His grandfather bought him one and his parents bought him two of them!
My mother is trying to get a good job and we are praying she gets it.
Just how they treat her is a bit disrespectful and it pays worse
My mother is looking for a better job_comma_ since not only are her two current jobs really bad but we also need more household income.
I know_comma_ especially since the job she applied for pays more than her two current jobs combined.
My daughter scored the winning goal at her last soccer game. I was so happy that all her hard work paid off!
Yes_comma_ she practices almost every day after school with her friends and also with her team. She says she will be a professional player one day!
I was really hungry yesterday and opened the fridge and happened to have all the ingredients to my favorite sandwich.
I was ecstatic. You're absolutely right_comma_ especially when it's hot.
Ignored my friends message on one of my social media sites that just wanted support from me after finding out her mom had cancer. 
Yes_comma_ indeed. Something that still bothers me to this day.
I am so nervous.  I have to take a really important exam next week.
Its a teaching exam so that I can teach special needs students.
I had an emergency and needed cash. I am glad that that my friend agreed to lend me
I felt very grateful and the trust that I had in him even quadrupled. I hope more people would be like this
My holiday trip has cancelled. I was feeling low for it. 
yeah. Waiting for the next holiday.
thank you! have a nice day
While camping alone_comma_ I awoke to sound of growling outside my tent. It sounded like a big old mean wolf who wanted to eat me.
I carefully unzipped the tent slowly and shined my flashlight out.
It was actually a tiny stray dog that I still have 5 years later.
Yes_comma_ it turned out well and little Wolfie is happy too.
I had to clean out my son's closet yesterday. I found a box of old newborn sized clothes_comma_ some I had forgotten about and it totally sent me down memory lane.
Oh yeah it made me want a new baby haha. It's definitely bittersweet watching babies grow up_comma_ it's so exciting to see them learning and growing but at the same time it passes so fast and you miss that little fresh baby.
You're totally correct. (:
I drank some of my mother's rum a few years back and I still feel bad about it_comma_ especially since she found out and scolded me for it.
I had fun_comma_ but at the same time stealing it from my mom was not my best moment haha.
My daughter is growing so fast. She cleaned the house before i get home yesteday
Did you do house chores as young boys 
I was shocked to see that I passed my history class with so little effort and studying
I wouldnt say as much as the fact that ive had american history like 4 times before because of highschool and middle school
I was really annoyed today.  I walked outside to get something from my car and a friend was just hanging out in my driveway with some people I didn't even know.
You are probably right_comma_ however I didn't.  I just joined in the conversation for a few minutes and then they left.
I think everyday how fortunate I am to have a house_comma_ car_comma_ food_comma_ water and air to breathe. There are so many people in the world who don't even have clean water to drink
Yes it is good to not take the things we have for granted.
Late last night I swore I heard some footsteps coming from my kitchen. I live alone and was convinced someone was in the house.
I grabbed my mace and tip-toed downstairs. I jumped in the kitchen and realized I had left my TV on. Oops!
I go for a run every morning through these woods by my house and I ran right by a deer without realizing it.
Not much of one. It scared me to death because it let out a loud sound right as I passed
I can't believe that I was 18 when I bought my first car. I remember being in the dealership and they handed me the keys.
My dad has his own firm so I worked in the mail room and I also did stock trading on the side.
That is what people say but I really worked hard and that car was a reward to myself.
That is so true. I can remember the smell of the interior of the car too and how my heart swelled up.
Last semester_comma_ I was mortified about the fact that I had to go in front of the class and present about net neutrality. It went super well though.
Because I hate public speaking and I thought I would bomb it_comma_ but I did super well and memorized it all!
Although I was running late I was still made it to the Black Friday sale and was able to get in the front of the line still to get the tv I really wanted!
Oh I wasn't stressed. It was amazing to get the tv for a great price when I was really short on cash that year.
I wish i was held accountable for the office since i committed it. But my coworker was and i am depressed about it
No i have not. I do not know how to do this
I was reading the news the other day and I saw something so sad_comma_ about some Christians being persecuted in Nigeria. I guess something like 6_comma_000 families have been massacred by extremists. It made me feel awful and sick.
I know it made me feel really terrible_comma_ I wanted to do something to help but all I could do is spread the news and encourage people to pray. 
Agreed_comma_ and I am glad to hear it. Hopefully it'll improve soon.
Im happy that the next year of uni is starting
Yea i cant wait_comma_ its nice being around a lot of people_comma_ my normal city is pretty boring
I'm awaiting eagerly to meet my friend. She is coming to my home.
yeah! We're best friends in our college. We're meeting now after 4 years.
Thank you! have a nice day
I ate the last one of my wife's favorite cookies.
She was not happy after she told me to save her some. I could not resist.
White chocolate macadamia.
It is a wicked act for a mother to spank her son and he fell on his face
Oh yes_comma_ i saw her at the park. I cannot believe someone can do that to her son
Sincererity is key to frendship
Yes_comma_even me_comma_that is why i love being sincere
I was so glad when I got my first computer. I had been asking my parents for years and finally got my very own.
Awesome_comma_ that is so fun to do. I spent all day figuring out how to program my Commodore. It was a treat when I figured out how to load some games.
I am so proud of my husband.  He just got a huge promotion at his work this week!
Well we did go out to dinner last night to celebrate.  We can't do too much because he has to keep going to work every day.
One night when I was crossing a road_comma_ a car didn't see me and almost hit me! I was so scared.
Yea I was shaking for such a long time after that. Next time I will try to be more cautious and make sure the driver sees me.
I thought my friend would never find a girlfriend_comma_ but he really proved me wrong recently and it makes me pretty proud.
I haven't met her and technically she isn't his girlfriend yet_comma_ but they seem really into each other and they are going on a date soon!
I think it is tomorrow!
I cannot forget my 25th birthday even if I tried. What an AWESOME day it was!
You would never believe it but my friends pretended to be kidnappers and nabbed me_comma_ so you could imagine how petrified I was_comma_ only to be taken to a room and hear surprise!!
Oh My God_comma_ you have no idea_comma_ I was petrified and my mind was going a mile a minute. I was crying.
I had never had tea thinking it was going to be awful but I recently had some and liked it a lot.
Just regular green tea. It was iced and not hot though_comma_ since it's the summer
I give my neighbor my house key so that i do not lose it. Can you do that as well? 
That is good. Do you think it can be wrong for me to do that
I became a great cook. I learnt lot of dishes
I am very good at teri yaki chicken
I was once a little scared that I was gonna die since I was in the passenger seat with someone who was very high driving the car. I didn't know a whole lot about drugs at the time.
He smoked some pot_comma_ so it really wasn't a big deal but I didn't know that at the time.
I wonder how my ex got such a pretty girlfriend. He doesn't look that great.
Well I would rate his girl as a 9 and him as a 6.5. Seriously_comma_ he drives a beat up jalopi and still lives with his mom. I just don't get it.
I am become so angry and bitter. My brother is having it all while i am at a spot without making any progress 
I am trying my best_comma_ but he lives so close to me and i can see all the progress and my mother do the comparison too. Everyone does it 
I was getting my email hacked and wanted to lose my temper and send the hacker insulting_comma_ threatening emails. I felt compelled instead_comma_ by my faith_comma_ to remain patient. I ended up getting my email back in the end!
Yeah_comma_ it might not be good to assume that but I couldn't help but feel that things worked out because I managed to keep my faith/patience that the situation would be okay. 
Oh yeah_comma_ we are planning on reporting the hacker to the people that handle international fraud/scams. 
I felt destroyed when I failed one of my college courses last year
It was only calc 1 so i was quite embarrassed_comma_ I passed easily next year
I have a friend that I know since I am kid. He is always there for me. He is one of the few person that I can trust for anything.
It is very important to have someone that you count on in your life.
My nephew hit the ball really far in his baseball game the other day.
Not sure if it was skill or luck but it was a great hit either way.

Yeah_comma_ it was a house party and it was a great time despite my original thoughts.
I knew that there is a lot of studying entailed when you are in law school. I was up all night studying for the Bar.
You know_comma_ it is more tedious than it is difficult because you have to do a lot of reading and memorizing. I cannot remember not going a day without studying. 
That is kind of you to say_comma_ but I don't think it is having a sharp memory_comma_ I think it is the fact that I dedicate a lot of time to reviewing and rereading all the material. I find that I retain more that way as opposed to cramming.
I am so chuffed to see Croatia in this year Football world cup
Soccer is my passion. Nothing likecroatia is my fav team_comma_ they were the underdogs this world cup. so am happy about they made it

It was so creepy when I saw a black cat following me on my walk. I was scared it was a shapeshifter.

I live by myself and I get so bored. I feel so depressed.
Lucky you.  I am very social so it is hard for me sometimes.  Hopefully I won't have to deal with it forever.
I grew these beautiful flowers in my garden and I had them for three years tending to them carefully. Can you believe our new landscaper mowed them over with his lawn mower.
That is exactly how I felt. It took me so much time to get them exactly the way I wanted them.
You are so kind_comma_ but it is just not the same_comma_ and I think if this was to happen again I will pull what is remaining of my hair out.

I just had a baby last month. My husband and I were planning to spend the first few weeks alone just settling in but our grandmother from out of state surprised us at the hospital planning to stay with us to help out.

I have a coworker always disturbing me during working to talk to me about subject that I am not interesting in.

of course yes. I know it must be something big. She is such a good giver 
No it cannot be. She will not send something bad over a long distance 
I didn't feel great one time when I showed up at court drunk. I was ashamed of myself
I was thrown down in a jail for the contempt of court. I panicked at every minute hoping not to be caught_comma_ and eventually later one of court dates it finally happened
Yes_comma_ I indeed did. Mostly because I went to rehab center. 
I was in a neighbors house when they weren't there (I had a key) which was not uncommon. I heard voices and felt like there was a ghost in the house.

My cousin was telling me about the family all heading out for the annual family lake trip. I was feeling so envious because I can't go this time.
I haven't been having a good relationship with my mom for a few years now so I'm not really "welcome".

Ye_comma_ peole are so greedy of what they dont have
Some people can kill just because of greed
When i lost my money I felt lost
I engaged in a business that later turned out to be a scam

My friend got a scholarship last year that he was barely able to get_comma_ it was quite a large amount of money.

That is correct.
Your imagination about my experience.
Okay. My girlfriend came to me one day and guess what she told me?
By mistake_comma_ my wife during dinner yesterday said to your friend that we hiking the same day that we were suppose to go with them visit a city.
They didn't say anything. I was embarrassed. I told to my wife that she was wrong about the date but my wife was insisting. She didn't notice what she was doing.
I was so apprehensive to check my mail today_comma_ but my heart erupted when I realized that I had 5 acceptance letters to medical school!

Thank you for the kind words. I can't tell how much of a dream this is for me.
I lost 40 pounds by eating right and going to the gym. Some people were surprised at my results.
Before I ate anything I wanted_comma_ but when I made a change_comma_ I threw out all pasta and sweets. I ate only chicken salad and green beans. 
About 2 years. Now that's not just losing weight_comma_ but also building muscle. 
One night I just got done reading some really scary stories and what made it worse is that my door opened seemingly on its own not long after!
Everyone must have at least once in their life. I checked to see what opened the door and it was just my cat pushing it open haha.
Oh absolutely!

Like getting my report ready 
On financial analysis
I was not happy when the car pissed on my new rug.
Yes but I can never get the smell out.
I probably will throw it out.
I was really confident one time that I was not the one that lost my mom's glasses to the point that we argued about it all day_comma_ but then I remembered that I knew exactly where they were...

The other day my cat vomited on my best shoes and it really made me mad.
Yea they seem to know what you care about and try and ruin it.
I really didn't have much faith in my friend when he wanted to get a better ACT score_comma_ especially since he started out with a 22.

I got a 33 after a good few times!
I built a sandcastle which looked just like the Parthenon and it took me less than 20 minutes
Yes. I patted myself on the back for that for sure.
Ah no. All it took was a couple of laps from the ocean to dissolve it. 
Me and my spouse agreed that we're gonna move back home to Texas next year. I am so excited.
I think so_comma_ I think it will be fun.
I went to a 4th of july music festival and a mother had her 6 year old daughter dressed in a leotard and paraded her around_comma_ it was horrible behavior for a parent
A lot of those people are trashy or druggies_comma_ really sickening to be around
Can you believe that my friend who joined the firm I work for got a promotion that I was competing for. She get's a very big bonus and a company car.
Hahaha that is what I was thinking too. She does not work half as hard as I do_comma_ that car and that bonus should be mine
I like you! Yes I do feel vengeance in the air.
Hahaha indeed!
I had this girlfriend only a few months ago and she was always so honest and kind_comma_ it really made me trust her and care about her. Things didn't work out but that's okay.

We both started going to the gym and he also started to eat a lot less and be mindful of calories.
It took over a year_comma_ but it really paid off.
Ever tried weed? I did over in Amsterdam and man I was so nervous to try it!
I was just interested in trying it over there and I was offered a hit from a bong. I was nervous like I said_comma_ but I loved every second of it!
It was bizarre compared to America but it was a great time!
How was life when you were growing up?
Looking back it seems to have been very happy.
I think everyone had some rough times. 
I am stressed. My wife is expecting a baby. I am happy but at the same time I feel littlle stresse by the responsibilities.
Did it go away after the adoption happened?
I remember the time when my grandfather died and resulted in a family feud. It made my life quite alone. 
Well_comma_ I was quite young at the time with no one I can relate to. It was very difficult to decipher_comma_ it was more of feud between aunts and uncle/dad. The life of poppop was especially not easy on them
I suppose it has to more with how rough life poppop had and its impacts on them. 
I ordered a package and had to stay home to sign for it and the mailman drove past my house and didn't deliver it.
No. I'm pretty sure they have something against me because both my neighbors get their mail.

Am always curious to understand things
I met this girl at a party one time and I totally thought she was into me_comma_ though I had no reason to really think so.
She was a little touchy feely but I think it was because she was a little tipsy. I asked her out though and she said yes and then we dated for a bit_comma_ so I guess my hunch turned out well.
I was super ticked off when my cat peed on the carpet.
Not really but he just did it for the fun of it or something.

My friends are late to plans all the time.
Just an evening beach plan. They were nearly 4 hours late this time.
They cannot leave power because of greed
Some politicians around the globe
I find it frustrating when jealousy kicks in.
It consumes me especially when my girlfriend and I go out.
When i won my 4th grade spelling bee i was so happy.

Man_comma_ it's not easy finding good online work. 
Well_comma_ I do have a physical job. But bills are really eating me up_comma_ and I'm currently on vacation so I don't get paid as much off overtime. 
No_comma_ I had to stay home to take care of dogs and cat while my wife ran away to Pennsylvania. I took my time off just so I could see my dying grandfather.

It was actually really cool_comma_ it canceled school for weeks.
As much as I wanted to keep my A in computer science back in freshman year_comma_ it didn't work out and I got a B.
It really wasn't. I was pretty happy with my B either way to be honest.
I had gotten a random call from a girl I hadn't talked to since high school.  Turned out she was in my neck of the woods and wanted to catch up. So I threw on some fresh khakis and air nikes and 2 condoms just in case. Turned out it's always better safe than sorry.
No enlighten me please
Oh man well thankfully I was born with adamantium cartilege...because she wasn't complaining she literally just left bro
The day of one of the most important meetings of my life and my nanny decides to come in an hour late and was not even a tad remorseful!
Exactly! The worst part is that I got into so much trouble with my boss and we almost lost the client.
Yes I guess he was_comma_ but the difference is I was calling in and updating them on where I was. I had to call her and she had the nerve to have an attitude too.
I cheated on my girl friend once and haven't told her. 
I feel guilty but I know I will lose her if I tell her.
Me and my mom have always had a trusting relationship.
Yeah_comma_ it's nice having someone that always has your back. No matter what.
My friend really is stronger than he looks. I thought he would have issues curling 35 lbs but he did it pretty easily. 
I'm getting there myself_comma_ I can curl about 30 lbs. I'm pretty proud of his gains though.
I felt so old the other day when I heard an old song from one of my favorite kids songs.

Oh really? I remember when it first aired and i wasnt sure about it but i loved it and watched it all.
I can't believe my sister stole money from me recently.

Not really_comma_! Its not like its scary _comma_but more light a child hood phobia. .Lol!
Their babies are treasures in their hands
I dont have yet
I refuse to go back into my neighbor's home. The last time I was there I saw ghosts all over that place.
They sure do my friend and I see them too. My neighbor's house though really freaks me out because there are a number of them and some of them are hostile.
When my son was born_comma_ that was the happiest moment in my life.
8 years old and getting more mischievous.
I was looking into the early works of da Vinci. 
The Caesarean womb section. I have to say_comma_ the genius and inventive mind of such a great individual is quite breataking.  
That's weird conclusion. But_comma_ Da Vinci does definitely hold secrets and died with them. He even might have created that very bizarre and undecipherable medieval book.  
My brother has always had more friends than me and even though that made me happy for him_comma_ I couldn't help but wish I had as many as him.
Looks like both had jealousy issues with our brothers.
I am so impressed by how a very unknown country in soccer like Croatia got to world cup final.
Ah yes. I didn't notice that. I still very impressed by their performance for small country.

That made us good children
For the way we were brought up
I just watched the testimony before Congress today. It was quite a show. 
Peter Strozy's. He was really acting like a sociopath or psychopath. There's even a new MEME in reference to Clockwork Orange just now about him being hashtagged in #StrzokworkOrange
Yes_comma_ but the targeted interests were more into Weiner's pedophile laptop and his lies 
Heights really scare me and I don't know how to get over it.
No_comma_ do I need to. Do you think it will help?
I will be visiting  Europe soon!
i am going to France and Italy.

Gold_comma_chains and other stuff
Slowly but surely the light at the end of tunnel is coming.

Hello_comma_ I just woke up to some nice sunlight!
Hmm_comma_ you are probably in a time zone behind me then.
I miss the old times when there was so much less crimes.
I really believe there was less crime. My parents were never closing the exterior doors of the house back then when they were in the house. People were more trusting each other.
A lot of people think Tony Montana in Scarface was the bad guy...but I think he was really the epitome of hustling for the American Dream_comma_ even moreso than Rocky because though he got killed at the end he still left a fortune behind and stuck to his principle: never rely on anyone but yourself
Yeah he was the freakin man. haha
Movies about vampires terrifies me a lot
Because i nprmally wathem at night
I watched the testimony of Peter Strzok earlier today before Congress. I think it's creepy more so even than vampire movies.

Memphis is my home. It is the perfect size got me and my family.

I enjoy playing squash and I always feel confident when I am on court.
I think I am at my level. I generally win most of my matches.
My current employer has financial difficulties. It has layoff 25% of the employees. I started to look for another job. I am expecting to be part of the next layoff.
I am working in IT but the job market is not good now. It is better to anticipate.
I tried to make small talk at my new job's onboarding and the lady ignored me.
That's what I thought_comma_ but we had an awkward stare off for a couple seconds so I'm pretty sure she did!
I miss hanging out with my friends all night. Those days are over.
I have kids and I get tired too quickly lol. I want to be in bed at a decent time now.
It sure isn't. I can't wait unril they move out!
Yesterday while walking on the street there was a man in the corner asking for money.

I get furious when I see politicians argue between themselves
Exactly and they sound very artificial articulating prescripted  garbage.
Yesterday sure was shocking moment to watch on C-SPAN. 
You should. I never thought that Strzok's dramatic show would spark the true evil during the testimony before Congress

Yeah_comma_ I was mortified when the person told me about it - especially when we were talking for about 5 minutes.
It was around lunch time. Naw_comma_ it wasn't that bad_comma_ but I did have to seek intensive counseling afterwards. I'm sure our hunter gatherer ancestors understand my distress. I nearly died!
I was very impressed when my brother came home from college. He was more mature and looked like a grown up.

A few moments of silence then we decided it as time to get it together.

I'm a bit unhappy with Summer being almost over.
Yeah_comma_ that's too hot. I can see your point.

My daugher is starting junior high soon.
She sure is! Junior High wasn't easy for me though and she is just like me. I'm a but scared.
We did. She is pretty strong.
I had to take a trip away from home for three weeks. It made me so nervous I couldn't sleep.
I was going to be away from my family.
It went well and I was happy to see them when I came back home.
I'm about to uber some lunch for myself. I keep trying to get my lazy children up but they are going to miss out
They will be upset when they see the bag_comma_ but summer doesn;t mean sleep all day. 
That's right
I got in my car to go to a baseball game. I was really excited to see some of my favorite players. When I got there_comma_ heavy rain started to come down. Eventually they cancelled the game.

Last night I was getting ready for bed and I saw a ghost in my bedroom.
Of course I did!  It scared me to death!

After working with my boss for years and years_comma_ we had our first heartfelt conversation the other day. I'm glad she is here for me in a time of need.
She opened up her arms and heart to me after  my husband left me.
I got pulled over for speeding today and the cop let me off with a warning.
I think I was just lucky.  That's the first time its ever happened.
No_comma_ I dosen't bother me.  I'm usually more annoyed than anything. 
a few months back I was interviewing for a job an was totally confident going in.
it went better than expected.  I went in preparing for tons of questions not knowing what would be asked and I was able to answer them with ease.
I always try to prepare for anything they can throw at me.  Yes I did get offered the job and i did accept it.
The other day I was getting my mail and my neighbors little grandson accidentally let the little devil chihuahua out! I dont think I have ever run so fast in my life! 
Yes! Their bites hurt so bad and they are so flipping fast!
I'm really scared of going in for interviews_comma_ I always get too nervous and clam up
Yeah_comma_ trying to impress someone in such a short time_comma_ I just can't represent myself very well I guess
My friends left me to go to the theme park. I feel really left out.

On a whim_comma_ I decided to buy a $1 lottery ticket_comma_ and to my surprise_comma_ I won $2 from that ticket. It was a small win_comma_ but I was very happy about it.
I happened to stop at a gas station_comma_ and was planning to only purchase gas. However_comma_ I was thirsty_comma_ so I actually went into the convenience store and saw the lottery sign_comma_ which motivated me to buy a ticket.
Thank you!
I came home and i noticed the door was unlocked when my wife was supposed to be at work. So i go upstairs and there they were having sex.

I am never late_comma_ but the other day_comma_ my alarm did not go off_comma_ so I had to rush getting ready for work.
Oh I wasn't late this time_comma_ but I realized after I got there_comma_ that I still had on my pajama pants.
People say i'm so naive but i'm not i just really trust people
I just don't see why i shouldn't trust people if they never broke my trust
I lost my dog a few days ago. It was really sudden
I did_comma_ but I haven't found him yet. He usually gets caught up in things so it wouldn't surprise me if he went quite far and lost his way back
On Black Friday_comma_ I was in line at a store and it was taking forever. I had to use the restroom so bad.
The person behind me offered to hold my place and watch my stuff_comma_ but they didn't.

I had to go to the bar alone_comma_ it was very sad.
I did not_comma_ I had no one to talk to.
I am terrified of clowns. I shouldn't of gone to the circus.

You got that right.
I knew I was going to get the promotion.
Yes_comma_ I had worked hard for three years.
I do not like the dark._comma_
It is just the fact I can not see.

My wife went out of town and I was alone for a whole week.
I watched tv and played video games the entire time.
I was deep in sleep last night and I woke up to this super loud bang near my house_comma_ it was quite scary.
I think it was someone shooting firecrackers for some strange reason.

I got really joyful when my dad got me my first vehicle. It was just a happy feeling
Its a good feeling to get a vehicle whenever

My nephew told me once of something really stupid that he would do if the situation arose
He would drink bleach. That really made my blood boil.

Paid off all my debt. Took 10 years.
Worked whatever I could and saved a lot.
I took my daughter camping in Catalina last weekend. I could hardly contain my excitement planning her first camping experience.

My neighbor's house burn down. We can't find where the cats went.
Last week. The cats are nowhere to be found. We even called the shelter.
The other day I was cleaning out my closet and found a ring I thought I had lost! It used to belong to my grandfather and it made me so happy to find it again_comma_ I miss him.

Hey_comma_ that'll buy me a nice steak at the grocery store.
I put in vacation request since January for next week. And now they're telling me they're too busy to let me go.
I don't think I have a choice. Otherwise_comma_ I lose my job.
So_comma_ I got done with a game and I had a bat that sort of fell loose in the back of my car. It could have been bad since I didn't have the back on it_comma_ but luckily someone stopped me before I got on the highway!
Me too. It could have led to a very_comma_ very bad accident for someone else.
I moved to another state and my family was left behind
It was hard. I had never been away from them before that.
I was home alone and someone was in the carport looking in a window
I felt like I was going into panic mode.
I get hit on by a lot of girls_comma_ but I'm happy with the one I got.
Tell them I've got a girlfriend_comma_ but they still come on pretty strong.
I got a job offer but_comma_ i'm not sure if I should take it. 
Similar pay_comma_ possibly more room for advancement but_comma_ I don't know anyone that works there.   So I could be moving over to a place with similar pay  benefits and stepping into some sort of fresh hell
Not unless we have an ebola outbreak or people start getting cancer.
I haven't heard from my girlfriend in 2 weeks. Wonder what's going on?
I was afraid of that.
The church bought us meals after my husband broke his back in a car accident.
They were really great and so was the food. My kids didn't want them to stop bringing it.

Been waiting to hear back from my wife. She's at the doctor getting checked_comma_ and we've been trying for a baby for a long time.
We're trying and remain hopeful. How many kids do you have?
My son is a high school baseball player. Last summer we started working on his recruiting process. I'll never forget taking him to his first recruiting camp -- I knew he had talent and was so hopeful that all would go well. 
I thought I'd die of nerves_comma_ but it went great! He is a pitcher and had a rough warm-up in the bullpen_comma_ so I was worried. But when it was his turn to take the mound_comma_ it went great! 
So happy and proud -- I cried behind my sunglasses! And it all ultimately wound up with several scholarship offers! So we are now headed into senior year_comma_ and he has accepted an offer for a school he loves! 
I'm sitting my friend's house while she's on vacation. While mowing her lawn_comma_ a rock hit her window. I feel so bad.

I accidentally left a very important document at my house that I needed at work. It made me look foolish in front of my boss when I didn't have it :(
I did. He laughed it off_comma_ but it makes people believe you aren't up to the task. So_comma_ it's not a good thing
I had to leave my dog at the vet for a week since I've been traveling. It's weird not having him with me

I had a baby last month_comma_ so happy.
It was a boy_comma_ I named him after me.

I had a flat tire while driving on the interstate. A nice man stopped to help me
You are so right. I offered to pay but he would not take it.
Riding a big roller coaster for the first time while having a fear of heights_comma_ I was kind of worried how I would do
It was great in the end. A little nerve-wracking doing it_comma_ but eventually after it was over_comma_ I had a lot of adrenaline and pride in doing it
I do_comma_ yeah! I'm still nervous about them_comma_ but it usually ends up being okay.
I was almost in a nasty car crash earlier
A truck was in the middle of the road on a tight country road
I believe I did rather well on my Law School Admissions Test.
I am hoping for at least in the 150 range.
I am hoping to go to Mitchell Hamline in Minnesota or Syracuse
Thank you_comma_ I should hear something in the next two weeks
I was shocked when Lebron left the cavs again!
Yea_comma_ I didnt think he had it in him but I guess you can blame the cavs owner for that as well.
I get nostalgic when I think about times with my parents in the past. A lot of different get togethers make me feel that way
Yeah_comma_ its times like that make me who I am today I feel like
I won the lottery_comma_ I never have to work again.
5 million dollars_comma_ yahooo.
Lebron needs to stay in Cleveland
But his home is in Cleveland
I know but now I am afraid he will never return
My husband hasn't planned a date for the two of us since we were married. Usually he looks for my input. I just found out that he is taking me somewhere special for the weekend. I can't wait!
It can be_comma_ I also think life gets in the way sometimes. Things aren't always picture perfect as we hope.
I was confident when I won honor society preisdent in high school_comma_ I beat a really popular girl
A few days_comma_ but it felt like forever at the time
 It felt good when Lebron left the Cavs for the Lakers
Cause the cavs owner is an awful owner.  The way he threw Lebron under the bus and talks trash about him.
I felt confident when I was able to study all night for a science test. I just knew I was going to do well
I did well_comma_ not perfect but good enough
I got my paycheck and there was more money than I was expecting
No_comma_ I decided to save it.
Before I met my girlfriend I felt lonely very often_comma_ I am glad that is better now
Thank you_comma_ I appreciate it_comma_ I am glad things are going well for a change
I will be starting Law School in January.
I am.  It is a goal I have had but have never made the jump until now.
Thank you for the vote of confidence.  It will be tough but I am up for the challenge_comma_ I think.
I got all As in my first college semester_comma_ and it made me feel really good about myself
No_comma_ but I do think they made it a little easy to get As in some classes_comma_ especially the general education courses. I got an A in biology and definitely don't remember much from it
I appreciate it. I'm a little bit of an older student_comma_ so I didn't have much to worry about in the way of feeling overwhelmed
Asked a relative to care for our pet while we were gone and the dog ended up missing.
That he got out and he was unable to find him.  Things are known to go missing when my brother in law is around.  We should have known better.
In a few weeks I'm going on my first ever trip to Disney World! It's taken me 30 years to get there and I can't wait.
The castle! That's what I've always dreamt about_comma_ walking down Main Street and getting the first glimpse of that castle.
My last year of high school I worked really hard and got A's all year long
It wasn't easy. I was working too but I did it.
I was not sure I wanted to accept a new job offer. I did not know anyone at this job
I did not_comma_ I was not sure enough
I procrastinated on turning in a paper for a college class_comma_ and she ended up giving me a D for the course overall
I had some that I did_comma_ yeah_comma_ during the year. And she counted it towards the overall grade_comma_ but I don't feel like it counted for as much as it should have.
I guess. I did end up passing and being able to move on_comma_ so there's that.
I was disgusted the way the cavs owner treated Lebron during his two stints with the team
I think owners should be professional because everyone is watching.  You treat your star like that? how do you treat the little average joe on the team.
My best friend for years and I got into a fight_comma_ I said some things I regret out of anger_comma_ she won't forgive me. This is awful.
15 years_comma_ it's so very bad.
I was hoping to get a new pet this year!
No_comma_ we gave one of our bearded dragons away to a relative who is a teacher_comma_ however its too much for her and she wants to give him back

Ball tag_comma_ ghost in the graveyard_comma_ kick the can_comma_ all the best games haha
All of my friends have these great jobs and they get to travel to awesome places so often. It's not fair_comma_ having to watch them jetset and have a blast while I'm stuck working all the time.
It's ridiculous_comma_ everyone has to be so showy. 
i was surprised when my parents gave me a car as my graduation present from college
It was a ford focus_comma_ it was actually a car I had and was in the process of paying off_comma_ and they just gave it to me!
I told something to someone that I had promised to keep a secret.
I felt bad afterwards for what had happened. I am a very nice person.
School is about to start. We are ready.
Yep. My daughter is so excited. I am glad summer is over.
I like spring because the weather is so nice.
I have always been faithful to my girlfriend of 2.5 years
I am thinking about it_comma_ we are still young
Lately_comma_ my neighbors want to sit around and gossip about the family across the street. They love to talk bad about them even though it's clear this family is struggling. I'm sick of it
It's awful! How are people okay with being so cruel?
I really went into care mode when my dad got sick. I just made sure he was going to be okay
I just knew what I needed to do to help
MY electriv bill is through the roof this month.
We went on two vacations so I thought it would have been lower.
I was impressed when my friend was our valedictorian in high school
Yeah_comma_ I was proud of them_comma_ I was surprised when i heard the enws
Sometimes I get annoyed by my parents_comma_ there seems to be such a generational gap between us sometimes
I guess everyone feels like that to an extent_comma_ it is unavoidable
I miss my ex.
He kept gambling away our bill money so I had to let him go.
I tried to paint my house one color and it turned out another color. 
Thanks_comma_ yeah its a bummer

I though my new neighbors was nice but I was wrong.
She is terrible. Thats not nice at all.
She is so loud and the police are there all the time.
I'm planning a trip next month and I am super excited.
I'm going home to California_comma_ I plan on meeting with my best friend.
I was embarassed when I was in school and my pants fell down in front of everyone
I was in kindergarden I believe_comma_ so still pretty young
Somebody said something about me that was not true
That is so true. People like that are not worth the time of day.
My wife forgot to wish me on our anniversary.
yeah_comma_ It's our 2nd anniversary. 
Yeah_comma_ it's her situation. I understand. But hurts a little.
I was so scared when my dad used to scare me as a kid
I guess he was just having fun_comma_ but I was not having as much
I wish I could go back to the first date my girlfriend and I had
Oh_comma_ they didn't end. I just miss that time_comma_ since everything felt new and alive and different
I miss being a kid and all the stupidity that came with it_comma_ I wish I was young again
Yeah_comma_ it is no fun growing up_comma_ but I mainly miss all of my friends from back then
I am sfraid of who will move in next door to me.
no. I never have decent neighbors so I'm expecting the worst.
Yeah I guess. I should just move.
Hi_comma_ the first time  went on a date made me feel very awkward
WEll_comma_ I didn't want to  let my family know as my brother would annoy me about it. So the only clean clothes I had were like a tracksuit
Not exactly. The next day at school her friends were asking why I had dressed that way.
Before I met my girlfriend and friend group_comma_ I was so lonely all the time
I was still finding myself and aI was very shy

It didnt matter as long as they were healthy.
I felt guilty when I broke the window in our house
I threw a football through it
I was upset when the spurs traded away Khawi Leonard
yea_comma_ they should have forced him to play a little to see what would happen.  maybe he would change his mind
I was disappointed when I saw how much the Eagles tickets cost for their opener_comma_ I really wanted to go
about 350_comma_ and I wanted to bring my girlfriend_comma_ so all in all about 740 with fees
I was looking forward to one of my favorite shows coming back on and it was cancelled.
That wasn't it but that was another one that I was glad came back and then was sorry to see go.l
I don't live in a good neighborhood. I feel bad for the kids who grow up here.

That is for sure_comma_ I just miss those days a lot
Sometimes even though I have a girlfriend_comma_ I wonder what it'd be like to be with someone else
I don't think I'd be willing to leave her. She's great. But sometimes you get that "grass is greener" feeling
I got mad when I lost my dog
no_comma_ he dug a hole and ran away.
My brother graduated college and has already gotten a job_comma_ I feel pretty happy for him

My daughter just had her first dance recital and remembered all the steps!  It was great to watch!

Thank you for the kind words. I hope so. I try to take it one day at a time.
someone backed into me in the parking lot yesterday because they didnt look in their mirror.
Yes.  The first thing they said when they got out of their car was "I don't have insurance."
I believe I do because it was the third straight time someone has hit me without insurance.
very recently i got back into cooking. i've always loved it and it makes me so happy. i recently made some jerk chick philly cheesesteaks and seeing an idea come to life right in front of my eyes was so exhilarating.

yes_comma_ my family has found it to be very beneficial for themselves.
I loved celebrating July 4th this year.

My mom said some pretty offensive things to me while my dad was in hospice. It's hard to forgive her for them.

One time I was traveling for work_comma_ and I had told my wife that I was staying in for the night_comma_ but really I went out for drinks with some people from work.

Went by my old high school_comma_ and seeing the students makes me miss my old friends.

I've been following my own weight lifting routine_comma_ rather than hiring a coach_comma_ and I've been making great progress. I feel like research is better than paying someone to help you.
Absolutely. In today's world where information is at your finger tips_comma_ a personal trainer is a waste of money_comma_ in my opinion. Though I guess it's good for those who don't have time to do their own research.
It's been about 5 years now. I've learned so much since I first started.

I'm so thankful for relatively good sleep now. About two years ago I had a serious bout of insomnia that I thought I'd never escape.
The crazy thing is_comma_ I had to go on vacation and sleep in a hotel! For some reason a change in environment kicked me back into a regular sleep schedule.

Yes and lots of brothers and sisters.
I am not proud to be from New York.
The people are so mean here.
I was thankfully ready for an important presentation at work that I had to give a while back.
I agree.  It certainly helped my anxiety too.  
It's hard giving birth_comma_ any way you do it_comma_ but I was still so happy when my kids were born
Yes_comma_ they are all healthy.  I've been really lucky.  Do you have kids?

I wasextremele upset when I found out a classmate was being cruel to my daughter
I spoke with the school counselor and told her the concerns of my daughter's that it will get worse
All of the sudden my light bill went from 150 a month to 398!  
I still don't know!  We've been dealing with it for months.  I've lived here for years.  What makes me so mad though is that they all keep telling me "well it is hot outside" Well yessss I know that!
I finally started to preface my phone calls to them with "please do not tell me it's hot outside.  I know.  I've lived in Texas my whole life.  I get it" Infuriating
My family member was going through a hard time. It just made me feel bad for them and caring

I recently got promoted at my job. It was something I had been trying to obtain for a long time.
6 years! I definitely feel I deserved it!
With all the catfishing going on these days I was shocked when my Tinder date turned out to be better looking in person.
True.  Have you ever tried online dating
Have you heard about Double Dare coming back to tv? I watched it the other night and it took me right back to my childhood!
Sometimes! I think it's more about families competing against each other if I remember correctly.
Last Monday was my birthday and when I arrived home from work a little late my family and friends was there.

It was a old CD-ROM game about the Busy World of Richard Scarry. Loved the show back then but the game was so much fun still.
Oddly enough you can play the game on the internet now because it's so old. No CD-ROM at all needed.
I don't know why I did but my friends aren't speaking to me and It feels very isolating. 
They ignored me when I did.
I cant believe what happened today. 
I found money on the ground! 
I worked so hard on a project to find out that they had 2 teams working on the same thing.
Yea. I'm going to look for a new job.
My niece will soon turn 20 and as she was discussing her birthday plans all I could think of was a time when she was small

Everything positive is finally happening. Everything I wanted to happen.

The are evil little busy bodies who think money grows on trees.
Im trying. But they are also kids and don't care about facts lol
I have severe social anxiety and don't have any friends.
why thank you_comma_ kinda stranger!
So_comma_ I got home from work yesterday and I found out that my girlfriend threw me a surprise birthday party!
I turned 28! I was so excited for the party_comma_ even though I think I'm too old for them.
I just rescued a dog this week and she was so abused. Just a baby. 
She was running around the neighborhood and my neighbor was going to kick her so I had to take her
I hear you! He doesn't mess with me though. She is so pretty was starved and overbred. I am so happy she is no longer being abused.
I was devastated to find out my cousin was killed in a tragic car accident.
Yeah. To make things worse_comma_ he was one day away from receiving his PHD. Really devastated everyone who knew him.
It just goes to show how fragile life is. Makes you appreciate what you have.
So when i was younger i had family over and also my girfriend.
Well i ended up making out with my girlfriend on the couch when i though everyone was in the dining room.
Well i got caught and i felt bad and awkward.
There's been noise at my door every night at the same time. I check and there isn't anything.
That's what I'm thinking. I want to catch them!
I promised myself I would exercise more.
Terrible. I have literally done nothing.
I bought an exercise bike and have used it once in 6 months.
Yesterday was an awful day for me...I got fired from my job.
Thanks for your condolences. I'm doing alright_comma_ trying to get over it. Have you ever been fired before?
I was in a group chat last night and forgot to turn off the cam_comma_ when I left the chatroom.
Probably undress_comma_ snore and fart.
So_comma_ last night I tried throwing a salad in the oven_comma_ thinking I was Gordon Ramsey.
It went how'd you think cooking a salad in the oven would go. The lettuce was scorched and the tomatoes tasted like dog poop. Absolutely disappointing.
Went to Texas_comma_ and it was raining pretty hard the whole time I was there.
Nah_comma_ not that bad. Just couldn't go anywhere.
I have been working on a new business lately and I am so excited about it everyday!
I am working on selling stuff online. It requires a lot of research
For sure! Except I can't get much of it as I need to save my money for business lol
So my father cheated on my mom once.
No they figured there problems out. But i was really annoyed at him for it. 
I couldnt believe my co workers took the time to throw a party for me without me being aware.
It really made me feel special. I was just not expecting it. It really made my day go a lot better.
Yes and I was supposed to have the day off_comma_ but it got really busy and I had to work.
I don't listen to any new music anymore
I listen to the same things I listened to in high school and that was 15 years agi
I do that with Pandora but i hardly ever like anything new
So_comma_ last night I thought I was Martha Stewart and tried out a new recipe I crafted - pepperoni cheesecake
Oh_comma_ believe me_comma_ I thought so as well. Turns out_comma_ pepperoni was never meant for cheesecake. I promptly threw it in the trash with disappointment.
My friend lost her job_comma_ but she won one of those scratch off tickets for $5_comma_000.
She's going to pay bills until she gets a new job.
My online friend appiled to come to America. We're waiting for some good news.
She's in Ghana.
So_comma_ went for a jog around the block yesterday. I was quite pleased to find a couple of elderly women were checking me out!
It did! Something about old women thinking I am attractive gives me a huge confidence boost. Maybe it's because I love my grandma so much.
It irritates me when my roommate doesn't clean up after himself
I say something and he just gets all grumbly and then it's uncomforatable.
I love being independent.
The best thing is not having to explain anything to anyone. I love it
Two years since I broke up with my ex. We had agreed that he would be the only one working back then
Went to Hawaii for vacation. Kinda felt like it was a waste of money.
I felt bored the entire time I was there_comma_ and anything I did there could be done at home.
I once had people pass right by a little chihuahua on a hot day when they needed help
Yes! He was in front of a grocery store..so hot! and so many passed by and he was asking for help. He got a great home!
No I adopted him out to people I knew- he wasn't happy with all my already rescued animals. He is very happy now :)
So_comma_ last year my parents got me a shotgun for Christmas. I was so stoked!
I take it up to my cabin in Michigan and hunt a bunch of small woodland critters! I like to think of myself as the hunter from Bambi.
My friend's mom isn't doing too well.
She fell suddenly_comma_ had to get surgery and now she hasn't woken up from it.
Last night_comma_ I did the most unfortunate thing. I ate three entire bags of Totinos 250 count pizza rolls.
At the time it seemed like a brilliant idea. But afters_comma_ I felt like a disgusting blob. God bless the Great and Noble Lord Totino.
The weekend was so chill and quiet. Now my kids are back
Yes. I think they have gotten even louder since they left Saturday. Geez.
Back in high school i ran the game club. My normal ride made left me early.
We set up game consoles and just play video games for 2 hours. But i had to call my grandma to pick me up.
I got a promotion at work which was unexpected!
I will be managing a small team of software developers. It makes me a little nervous_comma_ but I think I can do it
Yesterday_comma_ my brother committed the unforgivable crime of eating the last twinkie.
It is! I was so jealous that I didn't get to even taste a single one.
Found someone's scarf the other day and returned it to her. She completely bawled.
It was just a scarf. Didn't think it would have such value for her.
I was using the bathroom on a train in rome. I didnt lock the door properly and a woman walked in on me. She laughed.
Not good. I stayed in the bathroom and got off at the next stop.
I am in awe when people turn their live's around for the better
that is amazing and inspiring!
My friend hasnt been feeling well lately.
His heart has been beating real fast lately.
Last night was quite a low point in my life. I ordered 12 Big Mac's from the drive thru of McDonalds.
They are_comma_ but I felt so ashamed. Not because I ate so much_comma_ but because I didn't order enough.
What did you buy for Black Friday?
Lol_comma_ I went to best buy to buy a surround sound system_comma_ echo dots and smart lighting bulbs.
No_comma_ not yet_comma_ but I can if I enable the skill blueprint_comma_ and she would be more like a Big sister haha
Last night was an incredibly low point in my life. I went dumpster diving for food at my local Burger King. 
I've been in massive debt since I lost two million dollars to a Nigerian Prince. Figures that email was too good to be true.
At work_comma_ I am often the only employee in my building.
It's a small company and the other folks in my department just work part time. 
I suppose so_comma_ but sometimes I get really bored and need to walk to one of the other buildings just so I can say hello to someone.
I got a new puppy recently. I had been looking forward to it for so long!
I am! He is a toy poodle and he's got the cutest personality.
Hello_comma_ I felt trusting only a few times in life_comma_ the first time was then i began to date a new girl. I trusted she had changed from her past relationship.
Our relationship did work_comma_ but she had a shady past with drug usage etc. We are still together and she actualy did change
School is about to start. I can't wait
Im in college. My kids are goin back too
Im studying criinal justice. They are just in elementary
So my friend surprised me with tickets to see my favorite band this Saturday. I thought it was sold out. I cannot wait.
LCD Soundsystem. I have been a fan for a long time. Im really freaking out about going now.
I am feeling very positive about finally succeeding in busines.
It's just a business I am working on myself. I am the owner in addition to working for another company. It can be hard to get started in business but I am getting there :)
For sure. Thanks
Yesterday_comma_ I was crossing the street and the person in front of me was hit by car which didn't stop at the red light
Now_comma_ I am so scared to cross streets. I am always paying attention.
I have an important job interview and i am nervous about it.
It is just for an awesome job i have always dream to have it.
I am not in the best city and walking around the other night for a nice walk- someone kept following me.
In a city in michigan. One of the top dangerous cities in the USA
Can't always be helped. That is why I don't walk at night a lot- or heck even during the day
I am so ashamed. I wasted 300 on an exercise bike
I never use it and I don't think I ever will
To lose weight obviously. Id rather have surgery.
My friends threw a party for me when I got promoted at work. I couldn't believe it.
Thank you! It meant a lot.
Some kids aren't as fortunate as mine.
I can afford to buy my kids things. I always donate their old stuff instead of selling it.
I try to give back.
Yesterday_comma_ I saw a woman in the bus that her lollipop felt on the floor. She took the lollipop_comma_ clean it_comma_ remove a hair that was on it and put it back in her mounth.
I start to watch in the other direction because I was going to throw up.
Last year my little boy almost failed the second grade. I have been helping him study and can you believe that he passed third grade with an A in every subject. I am beside myself.
I think his teacher last year was very involved and was able to communicate what he needed. I think he has really formed some good habits over the past year. I cant wait to watch him succeed.
I am doing so well in school. I amazed myself.
I'm studying psychology and it is so boring I have thought of quitting several times.
I'm gonna keep going. 
I found a stray cat and took it home. He was sick and I nursed him back to health.
He;s doing well and he's my buddy for sure.
My 66-year-old retired dad is having to babysit my brother's kids over the summer_comma_ who are under the age of 5. I have to say_comma_ he's putting up with it pretty well."
Yeah_comma_ but he doesn't have a lot of patience.. And he curses a lot!
I feel so alone now that I'm single.
I have but it never works out. All of my friends are married now.
I did a while back. I might try again.
I was so mad at my coworker. He left for an extended work deployment and I inherited all his unfinished work.
You would think they would_comma_ but no.  What makes it worse_comma_ is my coworker knew I was being left with his stuff and he made no attempt to close anything out!
I have been thinking about rescuing an animal.
Maybe a cat. They are really sassy.
Thats the fun part lol
I'm really proud of my mom because of how she's stepping up to help my brother raise his children as he struggles to do it alone
Yeah_comma_ I'm proud of her. But sometimes I feel like she's enabling him and acts as a crutch for him. Don't know if it's my business to say so_comma_ though
I don't like scary things but I really like Stephen Kings new show.
I was suprised that I wasnt too scared. Its really good and not too terrifying
I hope you like it as much as I do. If it gets any scarier Ill have to quit though
"I lied to my girlfriend once about how much education I had because I felt she would leave me otherwise
Yeah_comma_ I had to. It was too big of a secret. We had a really_comma_ really long talk. But she loves me for me_comma_ so she was able to accept it_comma_ and I've started working towards almost finishing the education I lied about having in the first place.
I lost my dog the other day. They were my best friend since 12. Don't know what I'm going to do..
i really appreciate that. It'll be hard... Especially for my son. He doesn't really understand that they're not coming back_comma_ since he's just 2
I can't afford a new car.
Deep in debt and poor.
Actually Im meeting with one soon
I will be getting into some major debt myself soon with law school.
Though the tuition is enormous_comma_ I am excited about the challenge that lies ahead.
I wasted beer all over myself at a party the other night.
It was all over me and I had no way to get it dry.
Went outside til it dried enough. Its warm at night here.
School is starting soon. Getting that nervous feeling of being back in college again and having to make sure I can keep up with all of my assignments.
Law school... Yeah_comma_ my dad wanted me to be a lawyer_comma_ since he's one. I said no way. I couldn't handle that stress_comma_ and I don't have a natural interest in it. But good on you. It's a noble profession.
My senior year!
It is nights like this when I am alone that I will cherish when I start back to school.  But tonight seems a bit lonely with no one around.
No but I too have a dog that is great company.
I really get scared when I am around dogs.
I got bite by a dog when I was little.
So I have something to admit. I ate the rest of a co-workers sandwich the other day. I havent told anyone. Not my proudest moment.
Yea I know. Someone ate my lunch last week and I remember how mad I was. I know that is not a good enough excuse for what I did. Im feeling pretty bad about it right now.
My kids are so terrible sometimes.
3 and 4. They came running in here and wasted my last Dr Pepper. 
I just want them to go to bed and be infants again. They were sweet then.
I get to see my long distance girlfriend in a week! Really happy we managed to afford a plane ticket so we could meet again
It really is. We've been doing it for 5 years though_comma_ since I've been in school.
My husband has been clean from drugs for 4 years now.
It was really hard. I have been with him for 21 years and we have 4 kids_comma_ but I am so happy for him and what he has accomplished.
Yes it is rare. He will be getting his 4 year chip at the NA meeting on Wednesday. It is awesome!
My apartment is getting infested with bugs. I'm not so sure we'll be able to get rid of them entirely..
Yeah_comma_ not a lot you can do when they just come from other apartments_comma_ even if you kill them in yours. It's gross to think about.
Stepped in dog poop and tracked it all throughout my parent's house because I didn't know I had done it. Then I had too clean it up. Really annoying...
Happened earlier today! The house still stinks.
I know my Falcons will win the Super Bowl this year.
Yes_comma_ I was at that game.
I beat all of the crazy crowds for back to school shopping.
I went shopping weeks ago. They need the same stuff every year.
I haven't paid full price for anything since the late 90s
I am really worried I will let my father down.
Cause I usually mess up.
Ate the last biscuit this morning during breakfast. Then my child came in asking for another one and I felt really bad. Oh well. Maybe I'll get her something as a treat tomorroow.
Hah. Yeah_comma_ I'm the same way. But sometimes it's hard to plan how much they want to eat!
Didn't get to exercise today. I feel like I'm lazy
It's almost 9_comma_ and I still have work to do. I want to go jogging_comma_ but I don't think I have time :(
I wish I had  more friends.
I am very sky.
Really hoping my brother comes through and can fix my car so that I don't have to spend as much money to fix it. Otherwise_comma_ I don't know how I'll pay rent
Yeah_comma_ no kidding. If he can't_comma_ I'm doomed.
When I was a kid_comma_ I was pulling water from well in my grand father house. When the bucket was out of the well_comma_ a live snake was floating inside of it.
No_comma_ I started shouting. I was so scared.
Its frustrating to get paid less than other people when you are doing their job
They were just being lazy_comma_ and the work had to get done_comma_ so I had to do it
I work at a retail store and we had a closing checklist that needed to be done
Even though they're in their 60s and have been together for the past 30 years_comma_ my mom and dad still get giddy around each other. Makes me happy
I do! We've been together for six years. I still feel the same way about her as I did the first day. How about you?
My dog ran away and some kind person brought him back to me
I know I was so thankful and happy to have him back
My mom went through a bad surgery and has recovered well.
She had stomach surgery for holes. She is older and now she  is changing her diet
Thank you_comma_ you're so nice!
I am so tired of cleaning dirty diapers.
MY son is 3 1/2 those are baby poops. He refuses to use the potty though.
Two if they try. He is stubborn
There's a fly inside this house and I can't_comma_ for the life of me_comma_ kill it. I'm trying to work peacefully and it just keeps buzzing around
Yeah_comma_ they are. Especially when they seem to be particularly skilled at being elusive for whatever reason. Like some of them just got additional expert training or whatever
I was grateful I was live after a car wreck.
Thank you! Sorry I meant alive- It is very scary to be in the hospital and having others take care of you
Oh no! Glad you are ok too!
I can't wait for preseason football Thursday.
Yes_comma_ I love it more than any other sport.
My little sister is getting married!  I am so happy for her and can't wait for the wedding!
August 11!  I t will be such a happy event.  The wedding is in New Orleans!
The other day I won $100 on a scratch off lottery ticket and I couldn't believe my luck
I was shocked!  I am currently saving up money for a vacation_comma_ so it all just went towards that 
Thats what im currently doing.  Getting rid of that debt
Getting ready to make the toughest decision of my life tomorrow. Have to turn myself in for a hit and run that I did 2 days ago. Guilt has been eating me up
I was just scared in the moment. It was a complete gut reaction. I thought I didn't deserve to go to jail. But now I realize I do.
I have no idea... It's something I will find out tomorrow. Any time is too much time.
I can't believe I used salt instead of sugar in the cake I baked.
Yes_comma_ it was a disaster.
My wife has been very sick for the last 12 years and is finally feeling better and I am so happy!
We changed our diet to completely plant based food and in 2 months she turned a corner!
I sure am glad I have the mother that I do. She's so patient and forgiving_comma_ and kind and caring. She's helped me become the good person that I am today
I know.. It's sad that we can't choose our parents sometimes_comma_ as some of us don't get the greatest ones. But when you do end up having a great parent_comma_ and it was just fate_comma_ without you choosing_comma_ it makes you feel so grateful.
My bus didn't show up on time and I had stand out in the rain for an extra 20 minutes earlier.
I'm on a pretty bad bus line_comma_ though it would make sense if it was the weather. Yes_comma_ all dried off now_comma_ thanks!
"Had a really good spaghetti dinner tonight. Just relaxing and getting some work done now. Feeling pretty accomplished today
With work_comma_ yeah. It was also nice because we had everyone in the family there_comma_ about 9 of us_comma_ with lots of kids. Very lively dinner table.
It's such a bummer that I did badly on the job interview I had today.
I am and I prepared so much for it! It's all quite upsetting.
Every good show on tv is ending or has already ended.
Game of thrones is the top one. I want it to last forever
I am. It better end well because there wasnt even a season this year.
I was scared the other night when I heard several gunshots in a row.
I am. I am in a very dangerous neighborhood so you just never know if it's going to get you and the police don't show up.
Yes_comma_ I have thought about it. I have pepper spray and a few big dogs- I am saving up to move out of here soon and I have cameras
I can't wait to get paid on Friday!
I'm thinking save half of it and then spend the rest to get a standing desk. I sit way too much and my hips pay the price unfortunately!
I am upset Brian Lawyer died.
He was a WWE wrestler.
He hung himself.
I've just started taking a new body building supplement and it's working wonders so far.
It's creatine. I'm hoping I continue to make progress while using it.
It's very well researched and is proven safe and effective. One of the few supplements that actually work.
I know I will be able to get my speeding ticket overturned.
Yes_comma_ his radar was way off.
My daughter has learned to read and it is so rewarding to see her continue to grow!
Yeah_comma_ she is really getting to be so grown up.
My brother is about to find out that I had to steal $20 from him to pay for gas_comma_ since I was in such a bind. He's gonna be so mad at me
Kind of the latter... But still_comma_ I feel grimy about it. I just had no other alternative. I'm between jobs_comma_ and I needed gas to get to a job interview. We'll see how he reacts_comma_ but he has a short fuse.
Watched an old TV show that I used to watch with my ex-girlfriend. Made me yearn for those past times. But trying not to get too down in the dumps about it.
It was Dr. Who. She was a nerd who love to dress up as those characters and go to conventions.
I spend way too much money on food.
I get food delivered several times a week. It's terrible.
I know. I have to do better. It is a real waste.
Really don't want to start my new job in a week. It's at a fast food place and I don't know if I'll be able to keep up with demand
Yeah. But maybe it will instill some good work ethic in me_comma_ and teach me how to be good at multi-tasking. We'll see.
I had someone steal my lawn mower. I never had anything stolen since I lived here.
I think they all are. At least 100 or 200. I was shocked because I have a fenced in yard and dogs people are scared of- They WILL bite and are big- They were very brave and stupid.
Thank you! Yes it's been a trial since- Can't afford another. I hate thieves- Lots of druggies around.
My dad just passed away. Even though I haven't lived near him to be able to see him often in a long time_comma_ I really feel his missed presence. It just feels... strange
He was only 67. He struggled with a heart condition most of his life. Thanks for the kind words.
I was in awe at the driving ability of my aunt_comma_ she's old but she still has it!
Thank you! She drives an old cadillac and she drives it like a Ferrari. It's pretty grand watching her drive sometimes!
I'm having a party this weekend and I already got my grocery shopping done for it! I refuse to be last minute like last time.
I will be and be able to enjoy myself more in the days leading up to the party.
So I was at work today_comma_ wearing some slightly tight jeans_comma_ since they're slim fit_comma_ and I bent over and they split. Just like in the movies. I meant people could see my undies...
mortified. Tried to pretend it didn't happen. At first no one noticed_comma_ but then they all figured it out. I left at lunch time :(
I came back! Was worried about getting fired. People will probably tease me for a bit_comma_ but oh well.
I have a two week vacation coming out and I'm friggin' excited! 
Plan on doing both_comma_ actually. We're going to Florida for about a week and then after we return from that trip I'm going to just bum out for a week.
Yeah_comma_ I think it'll really allow me to recoup and be 110% ready to attack work by the time the vacation is over.
About to take my driver's license test in a few days. Been practicing for a while now. I know I'm about to smash it
Yeah_comma_ been getting a lot of practice in behind the wheel. That way my adrenaline doesn't spike too high. Wish I could tell you how it goes_comma_ but that's alright
I recently got caught speeding and lied to the cop about why_comma_ so he let me go. I feel kind of guilty/
No_comma_ it was a highway and I wasn't going much over the limit. I still felt bad_comma_ though. I don't know why I lied_comma_ it just came out!
just heard a thump upstairs in a house I'm house sitting all alone at. Really don't want to go check it out
I don't have a gun! Or another person! Ah man... Guess I'll just sleep in the bathroom with the door locked
Our water company decided to tear our street up_comma_ start on mine for like the third time in a year to replace pipes again
They want to come in my yard and house and I have dogs. They just have done this many times now trying to stop the led and I am so over it- No one is coming in my house again.
I don't think I have to let them in my house but they are out everyday. it's hard with dogs.
Got hit with a parking ticket the other day as the lady was writing it. I begged her to stop writing it in the middle of it... and wouldn't you know it_comma_ she did! So thankful.
Yeah_comma_ only would have saved me like $20_comma_ but still! It's the thought that counts. Some people have hearts out there.
My coworker made a mistake and blamed it on me!
He used my computer to put in his notes for a ticket he messed up on so it was under my name and not his!
Sitting next to my baby brother who's two-years-old_comma_ and he's just ripping farts. Really wish I didn't have to stay with my parents during the summer while college is out
Kind of used to it.Comes with the territory of being with a kid brother. How about you? Any siblings?
Watched an old Tv show I watched as a kid--a cartoon. Reminded me of the time I used to spend with my brother after school_comma_ when there was nothing we had to care or worry about
Yeah. It was the show Dragon Ball Z_comma_ some kids cartoon. We're not that close anymore_comma_ but I wish we could go back to those days for a moment_comma_ sometimes.
I pirated a few games recently and I'm enjoying the hell out of them. I sort of feel guilty for not supporting the developers though.
Older? I'm thirty! But now I have kids and money is tight sometimes. I might still buy the guys soon.
Hey_comma_ it's all good. I didn't mean it in a confrontational way_comma_ I just thought it was funny.
Saw my brother graduate college last month! Felt so happy for him finally achieving what he's worked hard for. Hope he gets a job soon_comma_ though
Ah_comma_ he'll be under a lot of stress. Hopefully you guys can maintain your relationship through it all_comma_ as college tends to sweep people away and take up all their attention.
I've been pretty pissed off about the slow internet speeds lately. I think it's the weather? 
I think it's time to get a new ISP! Any recommendations?
I have bad panic attacks about death after experiencing so much of it the past year
Yes people and pets. Too soon. So it definitely makes you think everyone is going to die any minute and life is meaningless.
yes very true. I try but when you go through trauma it affects you in different ways. Mine is to be terrified and want to die too at times.
I couldn't sleep last night at all_comma_ I kept hearing some weird bumping sounds that made me think someone was walking up and down my stairs but I live alone.
I do and that's the first thing I thought it could be.
Yesterday_comma_ I took a flight. During the flight_comma_ I went to toilet and a woman came just after me. She kept knocking on the door repeatedly_comma_ aggressively and multiple times.
She made me mad. She considering that normal. I told she should take a seat in first class so she could have a toilet for herself.
I just moved to a new city for work. I do not know anyone that lives here.
You're right I will do that eventually. That is a good way to change my situation rather than sulking around.
This lady at the store was yelling and hitting her toddler the other day when I was shopping. I was appalled at what she did.
I wanted to_comma_ but didn't know what my place would be in that scenario.  It was quite maddening and off putting.  
I ordered pants online that I thought would fit_comma_ and they didn't! 
Apparently my legs grew and I didn't notice! I do workout four days a week. 
I guess you're right. That's one way to measure progress I didn't think of before! 
I was shocked to see how many hotdogs they were eating at one. This has to be a sin...and a gigantic waste of food.
I think New York? I wasn't there personally but I saw it on TV. It was an eating contest but it was disgusting!
MY favorite restaurant was closed today.
I have no idea. I was really looking forward to a meal from there today.
That's exactly how I felt.
So I get bogus mail all the time including fake checks and all that jazz. Anyway_comma_ I thought one I got the other day was bogus too and left it on my counter.
Well its like work at home scams_comma_ and they want you to cash the check and send back a money order and then the check bounces leaving them with money and you in a bad situation. It actually wasn't bogus. It was a $500 settlement check from a lawsuit against my employer from 5 years ago!
I am afraid of airplanes.
I just do not being off the ground.
I am so fortunate to have a good mother.
She always cleans and cooks for me and does my laundry.
I was so happy when my son won his swim race.
Yes_comma_ he swam every day to get ready.
Some guy cut me off in traffic the other day and made me spill my coffee.  I was pretty upset.
I know!  I had to swerve to miss him and ended with coffee on my lap.  Luckily it was pretty cool by that point.
I have been single for a while. I miss having aman around the house.
2 years. I thought I missef my ex but wr talk often and I definitely don't want that headache lol
Thanks! Hopefully he is a decent driver
So_comma_ last night_comma_ my devious little mutt of a dog Mimi pooped all over the kitchen. 
It was no fun indeed! I was extremely irked by her behavior - and the fact that I had to clean it up. She usually doesn't act like this.
I do not like ants.
I hate when they bite me.
I had the latest night ever a few years back when I was in high school. I reviwed words all night but I aced that test.
Yea the words were really long man. I don't miss those days at all.
Man_comma_ doesn't it grind your gears when people make actual racist remarks?
Yea_comma_ one time I met an Uncle who I hadn't seen since I was a kid. I always thought he was a cool guy_comma_ but the dude just spewed racist stuff the whole time. What's worse_comma_ is that they were comments about my family.
Yea_comma_ I honestly hope I never have to deal with that guy again. It just sucks knowing I'm related to someone like that.

I will stay with her forever.
I will stay with her forever.
I saw the nastiest thing on tv. A guy at a sandwich and it was crawling with spiders. It made me sick.
Something was definitely wrong with him.

I almost got into a car accident yesterday. Have you ever been in one before?
Even though I didn't hear any of that_comma_ I still felt pretty traumatized - my heart was beating so fast. Were you hurt in yours?
I did my homework ahead of time. I knew I would not have any free time over the busy weekend.
I agree. I used to procrastinate a lot but I've learned that it's not a good habit.
I wish I could of said goodbye before my friend died.
Yes we had been friends since birth.
My dog peed all over the fresh_comma_ funky socks that I just purchased.

I am so happy it is almost August.
I am so happy it is almost August.
I love the heat_comma_ the hotter the better.
I wish I had kept my Maxima instead of buying an SUV.
Can you trade in the SUV?
Then why would you buy can SUV?
I am so scared of waterbugs.
They are bugs_comma_ huge_comma_ and they fly. One crawled over my foot at my grandmas house over the weekend.
I ran in the house.
Tomorrow is a fine day for me - I start my new job.
I'm quite anxious_comma_ to be honest. Completely new experience_comma_ completely new people. Hopefully I'll fit in.

Today_comma_ I ran over some roadkill on my way home from work. It was rather disgusting.
It was a dead possum. It was in one piece before I ran it over...but I didn't see anything behind me when I passed it. My tires must've grinded that poor little guy into smithereens. 
oh man I fell down a flight of stairs at the LSU game last weekend. I was mortified because everyone laughed.
Its the worst. I didn't want to come out of the bathroom afterwards.
I always let drivers perpendicular to me cut in when there is a line behind me. Show some love_comma_ right?

I went to an EDM concert that had artists that I used to listen to. It was a blast from the past!
Electronic Dance Music. It's where all the hipster millennials gather to party and listen to trippy music haha

She is! She is like Mother teresa. An example to us all.
I miss my father so much
He died a year ago and I still miss him.We were really closed.
I had been hoping and praying to get my teeth fixed for as long as I can remember. I thought I had saved up enough money but it turns out it's going to cost way more than I had hoped.
That's where I am fortunate_comma_ I'm in no pain. It's more cosmetic than anything else so I guess I shouldn't be so disappointed over it. 
My dog died last week. I've been so depressed without her.
Thank you_comma_ she was pretty old so our family sort of expected it but she left so quick. 
I do not like watching horror movies.

the dog was very crazy_comma_ not what I expected
I dislike customer service agents with bad attitudes.

I thought I would be homeless once and I was having a major panic attack. I was minutes from being homeless.
For sure. I did not have any family down there though. I begged and had enough to not be homeless. It was a miracle. 
I lived in a hotel. Had an abusive husband who would do things to make us homeless behind my back. I was able to get help from a friend- I eventually had enough miracles to get the heck out of there and away from him.
Whenever I see Jeeps on the road_comma_ I get so envious! Such beautiful cars...
No_comma_ but I've been in my friend's Jeep and it feels like you're in a tank haha.

I wet my pants in class today. I wish I could have gone home early.
I started drinking a gallon of water everyday. I couldn't hold it anymore.
I will thanks for that piece of advice.
I miss being a kid. Those were the good old days.
Not having to pay bills. That is the worst.

Man_comma_ speaking of being a kid. You ever do something you thought was fun_comma_ but end up causing someone to get hurt?
I used to enjoy slap boxing in middle school_comma_ but I stopped because one time my friend was backing up to block my attacks_comma_ and there was a girl lying down behind him. He didn't know and ended up stepping on her face; she started crying and I just felt terrible about it.
She was_comma_ but still_comma_ we were kids_comma_ it had to have hurt. Anyway_comma_ thanks for listening_comma_ man!
Sorry_comma_ lol_comma_ either way_comma_ thanks. You have a great day or night or whatever it is!
When I was at the store today someone always tries to cut me off and step around me so they are in my personal space and even hitting/shoving me to reach items. Versus asking me.
Oh thats strange. I haven't seen that. I just don't like it when people have no couth and don't even say 'sorry" or excuse me- Especially when they are touching me. geez!
They never heard of decency
I am excited for the upcoming UFC event this weekend_comma_ I already ordered the PPV and am so ready!

So this guy was hanging out of a parking lot in traffic while we had a green light- No he wouldn't back up his car or GO- When we beeped at him to back up- he had the nerve to yell derogatory things and beep back as if he was doing nothing wrong
Well he tried to cut everyone off and it's just wreckless. So many people die. I really hate it when bad drivers think they are not lol
The police don't really do anything here. It's like the wild wild west. Almost no one ever gets in trouble that is why they constantly drive 20 over and cut you off at the last second etc.
I know my father will always have my back.
Yes_comma_ he always is there for me.
I can't believe how great the Braves are playing.

Do you think there will ever be peace in the world.
I want it to be better for my kids though. All kids really

Someone I live with is mentally disabled and doesn't know how to say no...so sometimes weird men come and talk to him and they swear..and smoke on my property and throw their buts on trash my property and it makes me very angry
It is such a lack of respect to go on anyone's property and behave that way.

Yes the bosses love them. They get all the praise.
Yes I hate them I have so many side hustles

Yeah_comma_ I get it_comma_ they are very important to me though
about today's work 
ya mee too i like my brother
ya i too still i remember my childhood 
My childhood was mostly in the 1970s
You going somewhere ?

I was having a bad day yesterday_comma_ but my friends were there to help cheer me up. It's nice to know I can rely on people when I need to
Yes_comma_ no one can do things all on their own. That's for sure
The other day_comma_ there was a movie I wanted to see. I invited a friend to go with me_comma_ but they decided they didn't want to come because they were going with another friend. 
No...I guess I should have. I guess I really think they should have went with me too_comma_ or invited me to go with them. 
I am so proud of my wife_comma_ she was very nervous today but still went to her interview. 
Yeah she actually ended up getting hired even tho she was about to pass out lol 
This semester is going to go great. I can feel it!
I finally got my work and school life balance and I'm prepared so I hope so
I'm gonna get dean's list. I just know it.
So last week for my birthday two of my friends flew down and I was not aware of it. It really meant a lot because I just moved to a new city.
I couldnt believe it when they called me from the airport asking where my new place was. I thought they were playing a mean prank. I was shocked and so happy to see them.
I have a dentist appointment next week. I hate going to the dentist. I don't want to go.
I have a tooth that has been bothering me and I've already put this off for so long.
I'm very proud of my daughters.
I have two_comma_ ages 10 and 13. They are musicians.
piano_comma_ and violin
I had a bad surgery and I could not go home and take care of my animals and my mom did it all for me everyday.
Yes_comma_ it was 7 months ago but it was a long road. I am glad I had someone to help in an emergency.
McDonalds never gets my order right.
I do and I always have to go inside. It's so annoying. I hate that my kids love their nuggets.
I did. It wasn't a sastifying conversation either.
I had a great interview yesterday. Im really nervous and cant stop thinking about it. I hope they get back to me soon.
I keep pacing around. Maybe I will go to the gym to calm my nerves.
I pray that I will beat my disease.
Luckily_comma_ I have some of the best doctors.
I like to prepare before a long trip.
It'll be a family vacation_comma_ to a cabin.
We let our tabby/calico mix cat_comma_ Callie_comma_ go outside during the day because she enjoyed being outdoors and also to get away from our other cat who persisted on bullying and tormenting her. One afternoon when she was out I happened to walk outside just in time to see a stray pit bull chase and grab her and shake her around like a rag doll until she died.
Yes_comma_ it was so heartbreaking. I had to call my husband who came home from work so we could bury her in the back yard. He was heartbroken_comma_ too_comma_ because he and Callie had a special bond.
We definitely learned our lesson_comma_ but the silver lining is that she didn't appear to suffer. Looked like the dog broke her neck and she probably died instantly. And at least she was doing what made her happy right up until the last. That's great you rescue animals. Do you foster them and find homes for them?
It's always sad but there is little you can do other than keep them indoors where they are miserable. I'm sure I'm not the only one to suffer this kind of loss.
I share a birthday with my cousin and sometimes as a kid I would get envious when we would get different presents of the same gift. We would get different colors and for some reason I would always want the same as her
No idea. But you know when you're kids- she would get different barbies too and I was always envious. Seems trivial now but as a kid- I hated it
My partner is away at therapy and getting help staying somewhere else so it's hard but its' for the best
It is very hard. I live alone now so it makes it hard especially at night. I keep hoping so! As he has so many deep rooted issues.
I worked really hard at studying for the SAT. I just got my scores back and I scored really high. It made my parents happy.
Im going to study Finance. It just goes to show that if you put your mind to it you can achieve anything.
My cat died last week. I feel so lost without her.
She was 23 years old. I got her when I was 5.
I really hope my daughter doesnt get bullied in school.. its so bad now.. 
It really is scary being a parent and seeing how kids are to one another. 
My friend lost her job but won $5_comma_000 from a scratch-off ticket.
Nope! It brought so much relief to her.
I know I can succeed in my business if I work my butt off every night after work.
I sell stuff online and I let too much get in the way before but I am working hard at it every night. You have to work hard if you want anything.
My daughters are musicians_comma_ the youngest a pianist_comma_ and the oldest a violinist.
I'm the father_comma_ and thank you. It has been hard work_comma_ but what a payoff.
So I had huge plans to go away for the summer but that has changed. I failed one of my final exams and I now have to take the course over this summer. I cant believe I let that happen.
The worst part is that my friends are all still going so I will have a very lonely summer.
I recently rescued a dog and she was so starved and abused I am not sure if she is pregnant or simply is having a hard time after eating plastic.
I am going too soon. I have to save up for her ultrasound. I have rescued for years but this was unexpected and I don't have 100's laying around. She is not an emergency right now but it simply makes me angry she was used for breeding- starved almost to death and then left to get hit by a car- And so young- pregnant before-
Borrowed my friend's car_comma_ and someone rammed her the door in the parking lot.
Oh yea. I'm paying her deductible for it.
I am feeling in such a good mood this week. Finally! 
My house is going to possibly get signed tonight around 7pm_comma_ and I found a better job. :D
I am so thankful for my wife_comma_ and child. I honestly dont know what I would do without them. 
They really do.. maybe because they have never had to have it rough. We deff learn from the worst events in our life. 
My friend's eyes keep hurting at night. She's been to the doctor_comma_ but they can't find anything wrong with her
She's just been to her doctor. I'll see if she can see a specialist.
i really want to lose weight_comma_ i'm sure i can do it
well i've been struggling because I gained too much when my wife was pregnant but i lost 10 lbs so far
it's called "sympathy weight" lol
My little boy won the spelling bee!
I am. It was so nice to see him so happy!
My parents are getting old and I'm worried about them.
Well_comma_ there's not much I can do. My Mom's already in the nursing home_comma_ and my Dad's married (with me as the outsider)
Visited my grandma_comma_ and she is still as loving as can be. Her cooking is wonderful
Yea. She lives on the other side of the country.
My girlfriend is working in another country for 2 years. I'm afraid of the people she'll meet_comma_ but I trust her.
She's in England. I'll be visiting her though whenever I get the chance.
That promotion I was telling you about at work_comma_ well I did not get it. The worst part is that my friend did. Its hard for me to be happy for him.
I just cant stop thinking why him and not me. I received very positive feedback from my bosses. I just dont understand.
I love the goats of Anarchy owner. She gave up a lucrative career on wallstreet to save goats and now other animals that would otherwise be pts or used for meat. She dedicates everything to help them.
She has! She does have hard days when some don't make it. I understand that but she is a saint. if we all helped a cause like this- whether animals or people- much less suffering would happen.
She does sometimes. She dedicates her life too it. She definitely should get a show to continue to help animals who need a lot of medical care
"I was impressed with my friend when she finally left her ex
Yes he was very abusive.
I once lived in a hotel and was already overfull with animals and I heard a dog barking panicked in the woods one night. She was tied up in over 100 degree weather- no water_comma_ filthy_comma_ way overbred and starved.
I was terrified for a moment as it was back in the woods where some sketchy people hang out at night and live- but I grabbed her from that rope and I hid her for a few days until I found a rescue. I was threatened too- Her "owner" was out DRINKING instead of feeding or watering her- She was so starved and could've died in the heat. Even though I was scared there was no way I was giving her back.
My daughter walked the other day for her first time! 
yes it is really 
Went to the rec center today after work_comma_ and it was closed. They didn't announce it or anything
I play volleyball with some friends. Gotta get that exercise in after work.
I felt incredibly angry when my mom..who does everything for everyone and with a nice heart was gossiped about by my aunt until none of the family was nice to her
She just likes to talk bad about people behind their back. She just isn't very nice. She's one of those.
I finally got promoted at work after 3 years!
Would have been nice to get additional benefits but just the money boost!
So last time I was at my parents I decided to drive through my old neighborhood growing up. The field we used to play sports was still there. I cant stop thinking about how much fun we had there.
I did. but it was cold out so I just drove by. I wonder if some of my old friends parents still live around there. That was a good time. Being young and playing with friends.
Hi! I've been losing weight recently and it's helped with my anxiety. 
I definitely do. It's amazing.
My tooth has been hurting for over a month and keeps getting worse.
Yes and I do not want to go to the dentist. I hate the dentist.
I was by all of my cats sides when a few passed away this past year giving palliative care when they were so sick. I didn't give up on them until they were ready to go
A few were seniors..others..too young but had been with me for a few years. It's been a rough year but I will always take care of them even when it's hard for me- They deserve it.
Im still upset really about what happened_comma_ but I should just get over it. 
I found out my wife cheated on me recently. 
My friend got into her first choice school with a full ride scholarship!
Yea. She actually bounce from foster family to foster family. Didn't have the greatest support growing up.
Well our police don't show up here for even gunshots or rapes but they are so corrupt they had a "blight" squad come ticket our nice car for being parked on my own lawn..that I take care of.
I know. It's very corrupt here. We have houses all across from us that are falling apart and broken in too by druggies with grass 5ft tall- but they just wanted to have our car to resell thats why. It made me so angry as if our NICE car parked on my nice lawn is a blight :/ It's my lawn.
Michigan
I've been practicing speaking in front of people for 4 months now. I think I'm ready for open mic night.
I'm going to tell some jokes and hopefully don't freeze up. I'm pretty shy in front of people!
It makes me think of the good old days when I was a kid when I listen to the music in my aunts car
Yes_comma_ she plays 80's music and I grew up in the 80's
I snooped through my friend's phone and read some questionable text.
No. She's been kinda off lately.
Was supposed to hang out with my friend after work but turns out she has to work late
Yea_comma_ it does. Don't know if we'll ever to hang out.
I was really impressed when my boss won an award for his leadership
Yes he certainly did.
My daughter has become so responsible over the summer.
I really am. I used to have to tell her things over and over_comma_ but she has gotten everything ready for school and it doesnt start for 1.5 weeks.
She is gonna be something great. I just know it. Its really amazing because she is 13 and they are tough.
Got a call that I won the weekend trip to New York. I've never been!
Yea_comma_ I'm taking my mom.
I ran into a snake in the yard the other day.
Only about three feet long_comma_ but it did startle me.
Got to the hotel where I booked my room_comma_ and it turns out they gave my room to someone else!
They pretty much acted like I'm out of luck.
I am so excited to get away for a bit
It sure is.  I can't wait to bask in the sun and relax on the water.
I missed the sale on a laptop I've been wanting for work.
I'm not very techy_comma_ but it would be great for work. The one I'm using now is super slow.
I have been able to save up money lately and it makes me feel very relieved.
unexpected things. Yes I need to have many funds. One for car_comma_ vet expenses_comma_ expenses in case anyone loses a job etc. I am glad I can finally save some.
Can't always afford too! I am glad I can for once.
I went to my old workplace. A lot of my coworkers were still there. I miss them sometimes
I had to leave for more money_comma_ but I really did love it there.
Do you ever feel like everyone has nicer things than you do?
MY car is trash and it seems like someone around here get a new car every month.
Well_comma_ I'm definitely no. MY car barely starts when I try to crank it.
After 40k in credit card bills and a mortgage_comma_ I finally paid it all off
Absolutely_comma_ it feels like so much weight has been lifted off.
I got a new job. There's so much debt I want to clear off
It pays for the bills. Not much left for savings though_comma_ but it's soemthing.
I've gotten a good deal of work done today.
I do feel a lot better when I work well.
After trying to lose weight for years_comma_ I finally got to goal weight
It is. Stopped doing those fad diets and just went slow and steady.
Well the other week when I was low on funds and needed my energy drinks_comma_ I found out my mom had stocked up a bunch for me!
yes she is incredibly giving and always knows what everyone needs
We do!!!
I just grounded my son for a very long time!
He got in trouble for shoplifting at the mall!
I never liked exercising_comma_ but I've finally got to exercising for a good month straight
Yea_comma_ me too. I just had to make time and feel a lot better for it.
I found 6 puppies on my doorstep.
Yea_comma_ I think I'm their daddy now.
I have a friend down south who rescues so many animals everywhere she goes without any help. She uses all her own money and the police and AC aren't even nice to her. She goes through so much adversity and sees so much abuse- yet she keeps going with a good attitude
She is! I don't know how she keeps such a good attitude. She sees so much abuse and the AC doesn't even care. She holds dying animals. She is truly a good person! She is so nice to everyone.
I let out a loud fart while eating lunch with my coworkers moments ago.
It was embarassing for me but probably funny for them.
After the first team meeting under new management I felt very sure that i can depend on my team
It actually really helps to do team building exercises and group outings
My son just refuses to use the potty!
3.5 My girls were much easier. I can't belive he won't even try.
I try to but he won't even try. He throws a fit and falls out. It is really annoying.
Working from home now gives me the chance to be with my daughter more.
no more 9 to 5 for me!
I accidentally streamed anime through a meeting. My boss wants to have a talk.
It had girls with big boobs but well_comma_ I think I can explain myself.
My friend works_comma_ goes to school full-time and takes care of his sick mom.
He is tired all the time_comma_ but he tries to keep his goal in mind.
Ugh. Saw a little turtle in the middle of the road and he got ran over by the time I turned around and went back.  So sad.
I don't know why they keep going across roads like that.  They are so tiny sometimes cars don't see them.  
They are heartbreaking. I just save them when I can.
My boss wants me to babysit his daughter.
I think it might cross some professional boundary_comma_ but I can't say no.
I used to work from home before it's not as sweet as this gig.
It's working from home_comma_ but on my own time.
MY kids get to stay home and I make my own schedule. Can't beat that!
I was singing to some old school Britney Spears. Didn't know my coworkers were still around.
They pretended not to notice_comma_ but we all know what's up.
I am still single and all of my friends are married or engaged.
I am. It never goes past the first date though. I attract weirdos lol
Or maybe I'm destined to marry one of them.
My friend left her cactus under my care. It's been with her for 5 years. It's kinda dead now I think.
It's wrinkly now.
I am headed to the goodwill later to drop off some donations
It's the least I can do. My kids grow out of their clothes before they can tear them up and they get bored with toys quickly so why not?
I know. It doesn't even take much. 
I had some Big Macs and Taco Bell gorditas. They were delicious
It was! Thank god I don't gain that much weight.
My friend lost her job. I've been buying her groceries trying to help out.
Some but they haven't panned out unfortunately. She's so stressed.
People in my apartments can be so disgusting. It gets on my nerves.
MY apartment is near the dumpster and sometimes the just throw the trash near it and not in it.
I know. I've reported it and they sent out mailers but it hasn't changed. 
There's a restaurant I go to often with my family. After all these years_comma_ they're closing down.
You know what? That's a great idea. We should go one last time.
I took a test last week that I had studied very hard for. I know I got most of the answers right_comma_ but I got a failing grade.
The person sitting next to me copied my answers_comma_ so the teacher failed both of us.
Heading to the buffet after completing a ton of work
Definitely Chinese but they've got some American fare_comma_ too.
I just got a new appointment and I start tomorrow. I'm very nervous.
Me too! I go through so much preparation just for the first day only. I want to make sure I do everything right!
I certainly will_comma_ but knowing me that might be easier said than done.
This girl just left her Iphone with me. She doesn't even know me
Yea_comma_ she's coming back. I'm not gonna do anything with it_comma_ but someone else could easily just walk off with it.
Its meet the teacher day at the school. I always get nervous doing this.
Im the parent. I always feel like I don't belong around other parents because they are always much older.
I'm gonna try my best.
My friend fell during a race_comma_ and everyone in the race stopped to help her.
Yea_comma_ it's been rescheduled.
Everything is falling into place for me.
My job is good. Kids are doing great in school_comma_ and I'm saving for a down payment on a house. 
Thanks. All I need now is a man lol
Just paid off the house last month. It's so nice not having to worry about mortgages.
Make sure you don't buy more house than you can afford. My parents made that mistake.
I missed work to go to court the other day.
Continuance. For the 5th time. I so tired of it.
Me too. He needs to grow up.
Someone hit a coworker's car in the parking lot_comma_ and everyone came together to chip in for the deductible.
It is. I wasn't expecting everyone to come together for one another. This is such a great place to work at.
I remember a time when I actually had my entire family together for the holidays. It was really nice
We have five kids and his mother. Other than the kids I don't have much family. Our oldest kids are in college. Hard to meet up now.
I think my life is going pretty decent compared to the past.
Nothing bad in a long time is all. I am so used to bad news. Things are just working out.
Your'e right!
I finally got to go to the bathroom after holding it for 3 hours. Work is crazy busy sometimes.
It was such a relief. I was afraid I'd pee my pants or something.
My neighbors are the worst.
They have guests constantly and are always slamming doors. It's terrible.
I know right. I would never act like that.
I spend a lot of time looking at my kds baby photos.
three_comma_ four and thirteen. And they are all terrible lol jk
I hope they grow out of it soon. I'm glad school is starting.
I haven't gone camping in years that I don't remember what it's like anymore. Finally getting a chance to go again
It's very relaxing but might not be for everyone of course.
Sounds great. I haven't been anywhere this year and probably won't . Had a lot of expenses lately.
I hope. How has your summer been so far?
How adorable.  I wish I lived a couple miles away from one.
That is the same amount for me right now. Not good.
I once left my wallet on a bench outside of the airport.
I didn't. I was planning to buy my first car the next day and had my down payment in there too. $2000. True story
It took a while to save the money again_comma_ but I lived through it.
That's terrible. We should all count our blessings.
I found a snake a few days ago while walking in the yard.
It startled me quite a bit.
i killed it
I always bring beer to parties
funny thing is_comma_ at family functions I buy cheap beer. I get the good stuff for my friends.
Makes sense to me too. That's why I do it. lol
I put lipstick on before going into the grocery store the other day and when I got back in my car_comma_ I looked in the rear view mirror and my teeth were that bright red color. It looked horrible.
It would have been more of a shocked look I think. It looked like blood. lol
no. unfortunately not. I plan on  using the 24 hour lasting stuff next time.
I'm doing so well right now. I think I'm going to start dating again.
Two years ago when I broke up with my ex he took everything with him and I had to start over. I feel great now though.
I'm gonna grab one of them soon lol
I think there is a mouse in my kitchen. I keep hearing squeaking noises at night.
I'm too afraid to go in there. Luckily I have a door to the kitchen. Otherwise I'd just leave the apartment.
Yep. I told the landlord but he is so slow.
5
nothing...nevermind. work has been slow lately.
yes_comma_ my work is seasonal.
I have been really bad at work lately. Just plain lazy.
Trying to get school things together. I've just been tired. And the work is so repetitive.
Data entry. Type type type type type. And its all numbers. geez
School starts next week and I am all ready to go!
Just the generals for now but I have all my supplies. I even have my clothes for the first day picked out!
MY friend texted to come over the othe day and I lied and said I wasn't home.
She wanted to bring her kids too and I just wasn't feeling it. I feel terrible. I like her kids
Yeah. That's what I should have done.
She is. I'm going to invite her over tomorrow and cook.
Finally got some yard work done last weekend. The grass was getting out of control and if it's too high_comma_ you can't hardly cut it. 
I would like to concrete three quarters of the yard.
Just spray it off. Oh well_comma_ it has it's advantages I guess. 
My friend just bought my dream car. I have never been so envious in my life!
Buick Enclave. I wanted that SUV for years.
NEgative years. Its expensive and I'm working on a home first 
Don't you hate it when your broke friends complain about being broke...then drop $100 at the club like nothing? It's the dumbest thing ever
Then go to work and post on Facebook about how much they hate their boss...like get your life together buddy haha
5 years in my apartment and I have always gotten terrible neighbors.
That's the crazy thing. I just got new neighbors last week and they are a dream. Quiet_comma_ respectful_comma_ no kids. I love them
I once had neighbors move out while I was on vacation. Came back and it was like "2nd vacation" ol
I had been planning a trip to Europe for months and finally got all my tickets and hostel reservations. It was such a rush to realize it was actually going to happen.
Now I feel bad bringing it up when you've had such annoying neighbors.
Time passes on for us anyhow_comma_ and now my kids are in 5th and 8th grade.
It does_comma_ but you never stop worrying about them. I'm waiting for them to get home now.
At the time there was a friend that told me that i couldn't jump over him_comma_ then i jumped over him.
Yes_comma_ I was wearing my new shoes. My Yeezys were on fleek.
Yes they do happen to be designed by Kanye. They fund the rich life style of the Wests and pay their water bill.
Oh wow no he was five years old and he was laying down on the ground. I could of jumped it barefooted.
Started cutting my grass the other day and my pull cord fell off and got chewed up under the mower
That might cost you a pretty penny. Luckily it left just enough cord so I could tie another piece on to that piece and I can still start it now.
No_comma_ had enough to tie another cord to what wasn't chewed up. luckily
that stuff cost about 25 dollars_comma_ so I doubt I will be trying that out anytime soon
I love watching young Mike Tyson videos...watching him brutally manhandle his opponents then send them straight to the canvas face first...never gets old
...what are you talking about
I had a dentist appointment today and they made me wait over 45 minutes
I don't think I will be going back_comma_ going to find another dentist.
I asked my friend to get some stuff for a party_comma_ I knew he'd come through though.
Yes I agree_comma_ we've been friends for a long time so I had faith in him.
I was so stressed the other day... 
I had to put my dog down at the VETS office. 
Do you ever see kids playing and get taken back to your childhood? That happens all the time for me.
What a great idea! Who do we write letters to to get that to happen?
I cant not believe my family did what they did for me ! 
Of course_comma_ they bought a car for me... still in shock 
When I hear the song "Walking In Memphis" I'm whisked back to vivid memories of watching "Sesame Street" with my mom in our Hong Kong apartment_comma_ fun picnics on the beach_comma_ and stuffed animals in my room...guessing they must have played that song a lot back then
Thanks :) I had a pretty happy childhood...how bout you_comma_ do you have a song that triggers memories?
I know I shouldnt be scared this young of death but I am. 
My mom and dad both died from health issues when they were not very old. 
Back in elementary school I got the lead role in a play_comma_ "The Selfish Giant" based off Oscar Wilde's short novel...I was really nervous and timid at first...but knocked em dead 2 nights in a row_comma_ had parents and teachers crying and applauding it was pretty hilarious
Yeah you're right about that
I never feel more at peace than laying at my bed in the morning.
It's not bad to lay around all day if you want.
So the other day I was walking barefoot right? Can you guess what happened next!?
I wish... i totally stepped right in a fresh pile of dog... 
This woman approached me on Facebook Messenger about how she is seeing my boyfriend behind my back. They work together which is how they know each other. I approached my boyfriend about this but I believe him.
That he didn't do anything like that.
I feel mad when I hear about my friend's situation with his 2 daughters.  He's a single dad who works 10 hour shifts 6 days a week and the ex-wife collects the child support cash to pamper her new boyfriend 
It's ridiculous_comma_ and what's worse he's a good sport and jokes about it....but I told him to find a lawyer and tell CPS
I played Ice Hockey when i was younger and i wasn't that great at first.
My first goal ever after 5 years ended up being in my last season of playing. So it took me long but i am was happy in the end.
My brother has been really sick. I'm taking him to his doctor's appointment tomorrow and hopefully after that I can find something to cheer him up.
18_comma_ so he's too young and I'm hoping the same. But if it is_comma_ I will be there for him.
Guess what tomorrow is? 
VACATION DAYYYYYYYYYY YESSSSSS Can you tell I am ready for it or what? 
I had to go to the doctor recently to get something checked_comma_ always makes me worried going there.
Yes fortunately it wasn't a serious condition in the end.
I was mad when my brother got in trouble for no reason. My parents punished him for the wrong reasons
They did_comma_ it was too late though
Do you want to know something incredible? My daughter is!
She's 10 and made it through first through fifth grade with all As on every one of her report cards!
I am having a day let me tell you.. not in a good way either. 
Not really but maybe just by listening to be complain! LOL - i lost my wallet and my keys in the store today
man_comma_ when i moved out of my parents place it was such a happy feeling.
I was 20 at the time when i moved out. But all that freedom was just a great feeling.
Though I've got a long ways to go I'm waking up everyday with gratitude in living life how I want_comma_ answering to nobody.  It's pretty awesome
Yup got fired from my last job about 5 months ago...but instead of panicking I just buckled down and focused all my energy on making money everyday.  And for the first time paid rent with 100% self-employed profit so pretty happy bout that
I was happy when my dad got me a truck. It was a nice surprise
I was turning 18 and needed it for school
I'm starting my new job soon and I'm looking forward to the better hours and pay.
I hope so_comma_ but hey_comma_ even if I don't? I'm not working overnights anymore so I will learn to love it!
I feel bad about myself
I voted on Trump for president and I regret it.
Yes_comma_ but all the bad things Trump is doing now makes me sick
I had a job interview today! I guarantee I will get a call back for the position!
Thanks for the well wishes.  I know I have it for sure!
I love the buzz of discovering cash I didn't know I had_comma_ either from hard work or just plain good luck...puts me in a good mood every time
Yup :) thought a self-employed check was going to be late...but come Monday morning it was all there_comma_ and paid rent for the first time with 100% self-employed profit.
I just moved to a new city for work recently. I don't know anybody here and am just stuck by myself at home.
Yeah_comma_ I guess I should just put myself out there.  I hope I feel better if I finally make some friends.
I was late to work today because my doctor did not see me until well after an hour after my scheduled appointment time.
No I did not.  I will just find a new doctor.
My manager was quite understanding.
My manager keep lying about a promotion that he promised.
About six month now. It is making me angry.
In school_comma_ the kids would always bully me and call me names
I do not know_comma_ i was always smarter than the rest so i think they did not like me
I have grown and learned very much from it.
I knew I could count on my brother. He was there for me when I was struggling in life
Its the most important to me
My daughter is great.
She was just accepted to Harvard.
I trust my wife deeply
I was engaged to a woman who cheated on me.
We have had so much rain the past few weeks_comma_ my house ended up flooding. I lost everything!
I do but we don't have flood insurance so not much is covered.
You ever have those moments when people tell you not to bring certain things?
Like people told me not to bring a rain tarp for camping. But ends up it started to rain and my tent was fine.
Steve Irwin's death was kind of a shock to me since he was like a childhood hero of mine...that guy gave so much to the world_comma_ it's such a tragedy
I haven't seen or heard too much about her...does she even do half the crazy stuff her dad did?
Hi friend. I feel very ashamed because I got cheated on. I feel very negative and just depleted of emotion. I trusted them.
Thank you I appreciate that. I just held him to such a high standard and he let me down. A lot.
So_comma_ I did a horrible thing last night. I ate 12 buckets of KFC.
Oh man_comma_ afterwards I did not feel okay at all. I felt really guilty I ate so much.
I would love to try skydiving. I am so afraid of heigh.
I need to work on fear first and then I will try it.
I was scared when my dad had a heart attack. I thought he was going to die
He is_comma_ but it was scary then
Recently_comma_ my dad gave me some money to buy e-cig liquid for my vape_comma_ I am very thankful!
Well_comma_ I'm thinking something fruity. Maybe berry or watermelon?
So_comma_ I was putting on my cow poke boots the other day and found a snake in my boot!
Thankfully not. My trusty dog managed to dispose of it rather quickly. Never been so afraid in my life.
I went to a restaurant last week by myself_comma_ meanwhile everyone else was sitting with at least one other person.
Well I felt a bit lonely to say the least.
Aiming to have my first amateur fight this year and my first pro fight by next year at the earliest_comma_ fingers crossed
Thanks! I actually box..quite different but the nerves and adrenaline rushes are the same lol
I spit in my coffee cup this morning and it had leftover coffee in it too. I can't believe I forgot this and drank it in the afternoon...
That's a good idea_comma_ and I'm thinking about getting a spitoon.
I got to work yesterday and my coworkers threw me a party!
It was! I was so surprised and happy that they remembered it and threw me a party. It was very nice.
So_comma_ went to the bar last night and woke up missing my underpants. I had no idea what happened to them_comma_
Yes_comma_ I am okay. I was pretty thankful_comma_ since the bartender returned them to me. Apparently_comma_ I was so drunk that I was wearing them on my head.
I felt bad when I lied to my cousin. I mad up an excuse when I missed his wedding
I was hungover and sick
I had a very important sales pitch to some clients at work today.
It went extremely well! I prepared for it the entire night before. We managed to get the clients.
I went to the park yesterday all by myself_comma_ since my friends ditched me.
No_comma_ I don't have any pets. I was so lonely. Maybe I should think about getting one to take with me.
I had a 20 dollar bill in my car and I opened my windows. I couldn't find it so I'm thinking it flew out the window...
Yeah_comma_ that's what I was thinking. It was in a neighborhood so hopefully some kid found it and can buy something he always wanted.
Hey man_comma_ So i was wondering if you ever felt distrust til you met a friend?
Well wasn't until i meet my first friend i knew i could be happy and trust someone.
Well you were the first one i trusted.
I walked in on my parents making a baby.
It was a terrible day for me.
Every day_comma_ i see it in my head.
I bought 5 lottery tickets today. I am positive for the future because I think I will win
Yes_comma_ so I was thinking maybe I would win again. 
I feel protective towards my little cousin_comma_ even though I wasn't actively a part of her childhood.
Haha nope I'm a 26-year-old man
I felt good and hopeful when my dad helped me get a truck. I just knew he wanted to help
It was a nissan_comma_ it was nice
My dog finally learned a new trick after months of training!
I taught her to roll over! I was so impressed with her!
My dog is getting old and is having trouble walking_comma_ it's tough to see.
He's 15_comma_ he's small though so I think he's handling it better than the bigger dogs.
I envy people who can eat a lot and not gain weight. It's just not fair.
Maybe_comma_ but my brother eats a lot_comma_ if not more_comma_ than me and he barely gains any weight.
I bought a huge 500 count bag of totino's pizza rolls last night. I managed to eat them all in one sitting.
I felt pretty bad and bloated. I never did that before and I was so ashamed.
Just finished studying.  The peace helped me concentrate but now no one is around to celebrate with.
That sounds like a wonderful idea_comma_ I will do that.
Yesterday I failed my physics exam.
Well_comma_ I am really terrible understanding forces_comma_ but I don't think I studied hard enough. I was pretty disappointed with myself.
This morning I woke up to find my 120" flat screen tv gone.
I have no idea. Whoever took it must've been a 10 foot muscular giant. The police haven't found anything yet.
I was sad when my mom died. It happened so randomly
It was a random heart attack
I was expecting rain today because of the weather channel. Sure enough_comma_ it didn't rain.
Me too_comma_ it's so relaxing. I can't stand boring sunny days..
We went camping one weekend and I packed everything.
I always make sure to get everything needed.
I feel like I can handle myself in a street fight if I've been sparring at least 2 days a week in the gym.
I've dabbled in Jiu Jitsu but most of my sparring is boxing/standup
So i lost my game boy when i was a kid
Well when i lost it my parents told me i won't be getting another one. Luckily one of my family friends got me a new one as a surprise.
I got back from grocery shopping yesterday and I noticed that my wallet was missing.
I did_comma_ but they didn't have it. Thankfully_comma_ my neighbor returned it to me the next morning. Must've left it on my car!
I saw a piece of dried poop in my closet that I had no clue about. My dog sure is sneaky
Of course_comma_ I picked it up and sprayed some disinfectant in the area.
My dog took a fat ole poop on the carpet yesterday.
I was so shocked! She usually doesn't do things like that. I was so disgusted when I had to clean it up.
I invited all of my online friends in Fortnite. None of them joined to my surprise.
I think I played solo by myself but it is what it is.
I had to drink and shower in the lake yesterday because I lost my job.
I was CEO of Google. Now_comma_ I am a nobody. The water from the lake was so gross.
I got happy when I knew I was going to six flags. I could hardly wait
I love riding those
I love every year when I get a vacation and a raise.
It truly is_comma_ the extra money helps very much.
I want to spend time with the family.
Long time ago on my way to my brother hockey game something bad happened.
Well my dad got mad at my brother_comma_ honestly i feel he deserved it_comma_ but he stopped the car and broke the side window of the car.
No just glass everywhere and a little scared.
My turtle that I had for 30 years ran away yesterday.
Yeah_comma_ I think it's just because I'm so fat that I couldn't chase the little runt. He was so much faster than me. I was so disheartened and out of breath.
I have big fear of dogs. I can't explain why
No but my brother was attacked when he was little.
I took leftover money from the self-checkout lane at the grocery store. I felt bad afterwards.
No_comma_ I feel like that would be incriminating myself. Not sure what to do.
I was sad when my aunt died. It came out of no where
She had a heart attack
Today was a nice sunny day. I went to the park to read a book.
It really strengthens the mind! It felt so refreshing reading beneath the trees in the sunshine.
I was not expecting to win. When I scratched the last bubble in the lottery ticket_comma_ I realized I won 20 bucks!!!
Haha_comma_ but the bad thing is I bought 20 dollar worth of tickets again and lost it all.
Yesterday I got into a scrap with a homeless man over a half eaten sandwich.
No_comma_ but I was terribly hungry_comma_ since I didn't go grocery shopping. I felt so bad.
I need a tooth pulled and I am scared to go to the dentist. SCARED!@#!@
I can't stop thinking about it.  I am terrified!
So i do some silly things at time and i feel bad at times. I went to a buffet by myself.
I ate so much food and i was like a pig but i feel it was worth it. The weight gain though wasn't.
I always get nervous when I drive. The possibility of getting into a car accident is nerve wrecking.
I think it has to do with seeing a lot of car accidents when I was little.
I thanks God for my wife.
Because of the person she is.
I haven't had a date in 4 years now. My last date was in high school_comma_ I'm so alone...
Thank you_comma_ maybe I need to learn to love myself first
When my grandmother died i kind of lost it a little. shut myself into my room for a while.
I do_comma_ But i never thought i would shut myself out that much.
I didn't have high expectations for this new restaurant in town but my friend and I had dinner there last week and it was better than I thought it would be!
It was seafood and no_comma_ they weren't. Usually the restaurants in that particular building don't last long  at all.
My coworker told my boss that I came in to work 15 minutes late this morning. I couldn't believe he did that to me!
Yeah_comma_ I could't understand why he would throw me under the bus like that.  
My zipper was down at work all day. I will not live that down
It was_comma_ I am still sad about it
My best friend was sending her daughter on a plane to stay with me for a couple weeks. She told me she couldn't come along because the tickets were too expensive.
Actually_comma_ when I went to the airport to pickup her daughter_comma_ they both walked out of the gate together! She found a way to get the ticket after all.
I think I saw someone die today_comma_ I was so frightened.
I was driving and saw a big accident on the side of the road. As I drove by_comma_ I think I saw a dead person...
My wife up and left me last year
No one knows and she will not tell me.
If I knew i would tell you all about it.
So i wanted a party when i was little for my 7th birthday i think.
Yeah but this one wasn't planned with me involved heck i didn't know it was happening til i opened my front door.
I was let down by the movie. I was expecting much more.
The new tomb raider movie_comma_ it was so bad...
You know when you start something and you don't really see results til years later.
Well i played soccer for 8 years and now just finally scored a goal.
I felt bad when I lied to my dad. I just felt bad about getting in trouble
I got in trouble and was afraid to tell him
I am so mad.  My dog won't stop barking.
I mean its making me insane.  He barks at every little noise.
My boyfriend is making me so mad right now.  He is on like beer 15
I dont know.  He is so dumb when he drinks.
I lied to my friend about hanging out with someone she really hates_comma_ I feel bad about it.
No_comma_ but this person spread a nasty rumour about my friend.
I hate being alone at my house_comma_ it's not fulfilling at all.
I usually like being by myself but it's taking a toll on my social life now
Last year_comma_ late at night someone stole my phone.
It was my flip phone_comma_ it was the only one that I had.
I have not had the money to buy a new one_comma_ so my family has no idea where I am.
I had the worst night last night. I found out my uncle hit my cat with his car. It happened two weeks ago and he never told me! 
I don't know. I couldn't stop crying. It was just awful
Seeing expensive cars on the road is always inspiring. I am usually in awe because I know it takes hard work to get those!
I like big SUVs like Range Rovers and Jeeps
I miss my aunt. I wish she was still here
It was 10 years ago
So i am really happy now that i have a new girlfriend.
It's not easy finding someone with the same interest as you.
Those dang neighborhood kids keep egging my car!
I don't but it sucks cleaning my car off! It's gross and smells awful!
I get very depressed seeing roadkill when driving. Such a sad way to go.
Yes_comma_ I saw one this morning. It was rotting and crows were feeding on it_comma_ so sad...
I parked my car and got out. I forgot to put it to park mode so when I got out it was moving on its own for a little bit. I was so ashamed.
No_comma_ it was undamaged. But my ego definitely was because I was so ashamed when others laughed!
So i got lost outside of my house in the woods one night.
Yeah it was like super dark because we live in the woods.
My brother_comma_ dumped out all of my cards on the floor.
i cried for a few days afterwards
When I turned 30_comma_ my husband planned a huge surprise party at the beach.  It was amazing!
I'm sure you will one day!
I am so happy with myself. Keep remembering 8 years of that journey.
Well my journey through the college education system i should of mentioned. But it was a long time of stress and fun atleast.
I feel so bad for my husband.  He is getting a lung transplant.
I know.. we have to move to where the hospital is for three months while he recovers...
Thank you..
My father dropped in unexpectedly_comma_ I hadn't seen him in 3 years!
We went to my favorite cafe!
I loaned some money to my friend at work. Turns out he quit a couple days ago and I won't be getting my money back as I have no way of contacting him..
It was a medium amount of money but still_comma_ he did me so dirty.
THe worst thing happened the other day. I went grovery shopping and I thought I was being followed. It scared me so bad!
This big scary guy
So i found my old Nintendo 64!
Yeah it does! I am so happy it does but one game wasn't working sadly.
I did for about 4 then i had to eat something i got distracted.
I am so scared. I just heard a really crazy sounding animal coming from my lake out back of my house.
Im in Florida.. it could be ANYTHING lol.
So i love feeling great when i walk into exams because i actually studied.
But i do love the fact i destroyed that test like a boss.
I took out the trash this morning. The trash bag ripped open and made a mess_comma_ I didn't clean it up. I felt so bad.
Yeah I felt so bad for the trashman who will have to clean it up
You know_comma_ I find it difficult to respond to certain situations. Like when my friend's dog died_comma_ I just didn't know what to say to him.
Yea_comma_ exactly. What's worse is that it really affected him_comma_ the dog was like a brother to him. Weeks turned into months and you could tell it was still eating away at him. I wish life could be easier.
Thanks for hearing me out! You have a great day and a great life!
I laughed at this lady who fell over in the grocery store today. I'm so disappointed in myself for doing that.
That's true_comma_ maybe I shouldn't be so hard on myself.
After my grandma died_comma_ we had so much stuff of hers to sort through.
It was actually kind of fun going through her old photo albums.
I went to a new restaurant last weekend! The waiter really went above and beyond with their service!
I absolutely did.  He deserved every penny of it for the great job he did.
Today was pretty stressful at work but now its time to unwind with some binge watching of Netflix.
I just finished one series and about to start another....the mind and body are relaxed for sure now.
The other day_comma_ I was putting my groceries in my car and a friend that I hadn't seen in a while called my name.
NO - LOL!! I introduced him to my daughter but called him by the wrong name!!!  Oh my goodness!!  He corrected me and I felt about 2 inches tall!
My sister graduated college last week.
No_comma_ I punched her right in the nose like we do here! It's a tradition.
I am a little nervous. I am starting a new job on Friday
I know.  I was at the last place 5 years.  So its been awhile since I was the new person.
Man_comma_ don't you hate when you have a test coming up and you procrastinate studying?
Hahaha_comma_ well_comma_ this is a pretty good use of your time as well though! But yea_comma_ it's so much easier when you study ahead of time. I don't know why I don't do it more often_comma_ lol.
To be honest_comma_ I believe it. But maybe I'm just trying to make myself feel smart. Thanks for hearing me out_comma_ and I wish you luck on your test!
So i was exploring some abandon buildings one day.
Nah but something i feel found me. Started hearing banging on the walls and crawling in the other rooms.
My son got chosen to be on a TV show about comedy!
It's called Right This Minute. It's a show about viral internet comedy.
My son came home on his 19th birthday and was really drunk.
It was really bad though. He kept trying to take off down the road walking. I was afraid he was going to go to jail.
I hope he learned his lesson. He doesn't remember anything from the night.
I had an old pocket knife returned to me that's ~15 years old. My cousin had it
It was pretty random. I saw it and it looked just like a pocket knife I used to have and lost.   I asked him where he got it. He said he found it in an old coat from ages ago and had no clue where it was from.
Yeah it is. The old kershaws have a year marked on them (this one was 2001).  I've moved on to other things but_comma_ I still have a soft spot for a good pocket knife
I had to get something checked out at the doctor recently_comma_ always makes me nervous.
It was something that looked like an infection on my foot_comma_ but it actually wasn't.
My dog was my best friend_comma_ now he's gone and I feel isolated.
No_comma_ I couldn't do that.
I am nervous.. I have to go to court for the first time.
What if I say the wrong thing... Or trip and fall.
I miss my gradma so much
Yes_comma_ she dies 10 months ago and I still have not recover form that loss
So when i was a teenage my father took my game console away.
My grades but i ended up going into his room and taking it back. I bought that myself with my own money.
Yeah but it's my property he knows not to take what he never spent a cent on.
I hate having to wake up early for appointments. My biggest fear is that I will oversleep and miss it
I wish I was an early riser but it's not for me.
I had to get my foot checked out at the doctor_comma_ always makes me scared going there.
Yes_comma_ turns out it wasn't anything major though.
So dude i was at my parents the other day and found something really old of mine.
My old baby box with all the old childish stuff i owned.
I got contacted about a new job this afternoon
Another IT job.   The real question is_comma_ is the money there.
You never know. Some places try to lowball pretty hard.   IT is a unique job.  If everything works_comma_ people wonder why they pay you.  If nothing works_comma_ people also wonder why they pay you.
I just can't understand how some people can be so nasty. I go a little overboard washing my hands_comma_ but I know some people who don't wash theirs at all!
Gah_comma_ that's terrible. The worse I know is my cousin. One time that dude had a toe infection_comma_ he was rubbing his toe with his fingers_comma_ and all of a sudden he sticks his fingers DEEP into his mouth_comma_ I don't know why_comma_ and then he proceeds to open the fridge with the same hand. How do you NOT wash them in that situation!?
You're telling me. I get real anxious about germs when I'm around him_comma_ lol.
I failed my English exam today miserably.  The worst in class.
My grade sure did reflect it.
I guarantee you have never heard a thing more vile. My best friend's husband cheated on her with his sister in law!
She does but I imagine it's going to be very hard for her.
Someone hit my car while it was parked the other day. He even parked next to my car.
The guy tried to ignore me as he got into his car. Called the cops and they forced him too._comma_
I was shopping for groceries the other day and saw someone in a dog costume_comma_ pretty unexpected.
I think it was supposed to be a golden retriever_comma_ but it looked weird.
My aunt can juggle 6 items
Mostly jobs and children.
I did not mean to be? I wanted to tell you about how amazing she is.
I was so embarrassed.  I farted while I was out on a date.
No they lived.  We both did.  I just pretended nothing happened.
My son always thinks of me when I need it the most. He's super intuitive.
It does_comma_ he had no idea I was running short on money but he stopped by my house with dinner!
I learned today that my friends wife had an affair with his brother.  I'm beyond flabbergasted.
I don't know.  I thought I knew who she was_comma_ obviously I don't.
So i was watching a movie with our other friend the other night. 
Finding Nemo but it was more what happened during the movie. Heard this loud bang sound. It spooked us good.
I am so scared! LOL.  I think I just heard a ghost coming from the other room here.
I kid you not.  My one dog keeps barking at nothing but acting like he can see something.
I purchased a new router and it was DOA when it got to me today :(
The package wasn't too beat up
They have a good return policy.  Just annoying as hell. 
I am jealous of my best friend.  She just had a baby.
No.. actually I am older.  Too old to have a baby :(
Guess what I get to do tomorrow!!!
I'm going on vacation! I haven't been on one in years!
We were stuck in traffic for over an hour due to a wreck the other day.
Yes_comma_ it wasn't a bad wreck.  But this buffoon thought he was more important than anyone else_comma_ and flew up beside us in the emergency lane.!
Well_comma_ I think he got what he deserved.  About 10 seconds later_comma_ the police flew up that same emergency lane!
Everyone has already left the office. It's oddly quiet.
I have to wait for something to come in. Not sure how long it's gonna be.
I cannot believe that my own son would steal from me!!!!
I have no idea but I thought I raised him better than this! $600 gone!
After a long day at work_comma_ I was surprised to find my daughter had cooked the family dinner. 
It was very delicious and even more appreciated that's for sure.
I was watching old videos of my nieces and nephew when they were little. It really took me back.".
That is so true. It can really take you right back to the moment.
I guess I'm not as liked as I thought I am.
No one rsvped to my birthday party_comma_ I'm pretty bummed.
My daughter told me I should be expecting a shipment soon. I don't know what it could be!
Yea. She won't tell me what it is. I hope she didn't spend too much money though.
The new addition to our family was just born this weekend.
It's a girl! I'm so excited but also kind of scared of parenting!
When my girls were younger and playing softball sometimes I couldn't make it to all of their games.
Yeah it was hard to have to miss some. Luckily though I did have family that went so they weren't unwatched.
I was hoping to join my family for dinner but seems like I'm stuck at work
No_comma_ I wouldn't want them to. It's 8pm now. I just wish work was more considerate of my time.
I just finished the first season of Mind hunter on Netflix. I almost wet my pants.
Serial Killer and FBI profiling. Its intense.
I was supposed to be off work 3 hours ago. I'm still here
hahaha yea. Might as well do something instead of sitting around waiting on this shipment.
I feel so guilty.  I cheated on my husband.
I just lost control.  I feel horrible for doing it.  But it just had to be done.
My children have started a new year at school.
There are two girls_comma_ they are ready to go_comma_ I'm the one that's nervous.
I told my kids that there were no sweets when there were
No. I just wanted it for myself. 
Before I was dating to my wife she was going to a conference without me and I was afraid she was going to fall for someone else.  Needless to say I went to the conference.
I'm fine now I completely trust her since we're married_comma_ but she was going a church singles conference without me.
I forgot to bring my towel and had to run naked out of the common shower area to the locker rooms.
Nope. Unfortunately_comma_ I was the last one out.
"My oldest girls are just over a year apart. I wasn't expecting to have another baby so soon.
That makes 3 girls. They keep me on my toes.
My friend hasn't answered me calls for 2 weeks now. I don't know what's going on.
I asked their roommates but they don't know anything.
I got a $1_comma_000 scholarship for tuition. Doesn't cover everything_comma_ but it's something.
I'm in marketing. I find what influences people interesting.
I recently started work again and I am also picking back up my business. It is making me feel happy about the future
Thank you! yes it is. It's been a really terrible year with lots of deaths so it's a miracle I am even here.
yes they do! Thank you
I was outside when lightning struck a tree that was close to me.
I thought I was a goner.
I went to register my youngest daughter for school today.
It maybe would have been if anyone was at the school. I really don't want her to go there but the private school had too long of a waiting list for this year.
It was open and they just left flyers. I don't even know who my childs teacher is. The public schools here are trash.
I'm going to get her in the private school my oldest went to. It will be fine she is only ine pre k now.
We have some very bad storms headed our way this evening_comma_ possible tornadoes too.
I have cleared a safe spot in the basement and also taken down a tote full of food_comma_ water_comma_ and other emergency supplies.
I was at the store and did not have enough money to pay for my items. The person behind be paid for my groceries
I couldn't believe that someone would do that for me.
Well I rescued another dog the other day and thankfully she is very calm and sweet but I was so worried when I saw her as I already have more then enough animals.
She is in between. Just a pocket pit. She was so starved and abused and maybe pregnant. I had to help her. Even though it makes me worried- I am over the city limit.
I know. And rescues never help me. So many are not nice anyway to people. I will make sure she is ok. Her name is sweetie. She is so docile and scared of everything. Most docile terrier ever.
I love seeing all the kids excited about school starting again.
Especially the elementary kids. I want them to love school forever. That's a pipe dream.
MY daughter had a teacher like that in pre k. We send her a card every year. She is in tehe 8th grade now!
We had a bad storm and the power was out for hours during the night
Storms are so unpredictable. It's best to be prepared when you know they are coming.
Checked out my old yearbook. It was so much easier making friends back then.
Yea_comma_ I guess that happens with time. Wish it wasn't so though.
Well I used to live in a hotel down south and I was scared all the time. I had too many pets and scared I would be found out a lot and kicked out. It was like living while hiding things from the nazis. I'd never live that way again.
Too many! lol- I had more at the time- but they only wanted you to have 2- they don't like pets down there very much. I rescue- so lots! :)
:) It's hard work! Thats why I work from home but worth it
Going on a date with my crush this weekend. I'm kinda nervous!
Butterflies are great. It means I like her_comma_ but I just hope I don't make a doofus of myself.
My nieces pet guinea pig died yesterday
She was upset. But I feel for the one left behind. They were sisters.
We have our water pipes being redone in our corrupt city for the third or fourth time. They blocked my street and the mailman still isn't delivering and the garbage was not picked up. 
Thats true lol. I could do that. But they'd likely harm me- One of those corrupt cities where they don't care about crime and rapes but care about the little dumb things
Oh it's flint_comma_ MI- they are very famous for being corrupt. Nothing I can do but save up to move out :)
Wow! yes- it was good for a time but it is SO corrupt here and bills so high- I thought it was cheap no- Yes I am saving to move and working on a business too! outta here soon- it's so dangerous and it IS the ghetto.
We're behind on a work project_comma_ but our boss told us not to worry about it and go home for the day.
We think he's a great guy. I hope work doesn't change him.
I told my friend I needed to borrow money for some car repairs but I used it for something else completely. I feel bad about it.
I don't even want to say_comma_ I'm so ashamed.
MY nest will be empty soon. I don't know what I'm going to do.
I'm too old for that. I think I'll buy a bunch of jugsaw puzzles.
Yoga? oh lord. Painting sounds fun though
I think I'll look into it. Seriously.
Fruits have been so expensive lately_comma_ so our neighbors always brings us a basket of pears from their trees!
They are great people. They had so many that instead of throwing them out_comma_ they took the time to collect them and share it with us!
I'm really happy with how things are going at work right now.  I just got a raise_comma_ and a promotion.
I hope so too.  Things don't normally go this well so I'm enjoying while it lasts.
I had plans with my friend to go to dinner_comma_ but I chose to stay at work to make more money
No. She's not taking my calls currently.
My girls went on an out of town trip and I was home alone
You would think but I really missed them.
My mom had to put our family dog to sleep last week.
It's so hard because we have had her since I was in 1st grade. She was so old and sick.
I'm leaving for vacation soon! I'm so pumped! It can't come soon enough!
Disney World_comma_ I've never been!
I wish I was born wealthy. I have to give up spending time with my family to get more hours at work in.
Yes_comma_ it definitely is. Gotta work with what ya got.
My friends left on a trip_comma_ but I couldn't go with them because I have so many projects to work on.
Yea definitely. I hope we get another time sooner than later.
I was crossing a wet road and slipped. I fell with a thud right on my rear end
Very funny. All I could do is sit there and laugh.
I heard one of my favorite youtubers talking about the 90's the other day and how old we were lol. But it reminded me of fun times as a teen
I am not sure I can pick on favorite but I loved how there were no bills lol and it was just freedom to be creative and listen to music all night and hang out with friends talking until the late hours :)
My friend left me with her dog. Never met this little guy
Yep. We are getting along so far. Looks like he misses his mommy though.
After all these years as a single mom_comma_ my kid is now a successful researcher. He's pretty happy in life.
He's working on Parkinson actually. He has such a great heart.
Someone ate the last piece of pizza this afternoon_comma_ when I was away all day and looking forward to eating it. I hate living with family during the summer_comma_ because my siblings eat and take things that aren't theirs!
If I'm being honest_comma_ they're not all bad. The older one helps me with a lot of things. And the younger ones can be funny. But yeah_comma_ sometimes they just.. .get to me.
My favorite team has a new Quarterback. Maybe this will be a better season for them
I like college football. I root for Arkansas.
After a long hard day at work_comma_ I came home to an empty house.
Bad as there is no one to share my thoughts and relieve stress with.
I have an older mailman...around 40 and he is the kind here and he constantly writes on my mail and doesn't deliver it.
He thinks he is the king*. He is very bad. My mailbox is on the outside of my fence but he writes "dogs" on it..won't deliver it and also he throws my packages to wreck them. Post office thinks he is great and won't do anything about it.
I know! I just got cameras for that except I never have packages delivered here anymore because of him.
I was so scared today! I was taking out the garbage and a huge raccoon jumped out at me from behind the trash can!
Yes! He almost gave me a heart attack! I ran screaming back into the house!
I was going to have dinner with my family_comma_ but we're on the highway to New York it seems.
Well_comma_ it's unplanned for me_comma_ but I think they definitely planned this.
Who does my neighbor think he is hitting on my wife at the block party??
It is_comma_ I hope he steps on a nail! What a jerk!!!
We are behind on a work project_comma_ but we came in this morning and it seems like one of our coworkers finished it all by himself over night.
Yes_comma_ we do. He's a terrific guy. He said since he's single_comma_ he wanted us to be with our families.
It took so much time to finish the tree house_comma_ but we're finally done
Yea_comma_ the kids seem pretty happy with it.
My daughter took it upon herself to make extra money mowing yards.
She is growing up and showing so much initiative.
We submitted our proposal for the new project and hope we get it. It would be such a high profile project that would get us a lot of new clients if successful.
Thank you so much! I hope so_comma_ too.
I just recently took the LSAT and did well.  I hope to be starting law school in the spirng.
Thank you! I hope to get into Syracuse.
I'm going to be away from my girlfriend for a year_comma_ but she should know that she can trust me.
Thank you. It will definitely test our relationship and hopefully_comma_ we come through it.
My husband is so amazing. I can trust him totally.
I used to be a really jealous person and was always picking a fight thinking something was up. I have learned after 21 years how to deal with my problem.
Yes_comma_ it has been tough at times_comma_ but we have made it through. We now have 6 kids and 7 grandkids between the 2 of us.
We decided not to hire a roofer and do this thing on our own
Yep. We are. Hopefully_comma_ Youtube pulls through.
I am feeling down tonight.  I am broke until next week.
Yeah.  I have some raman.  Thats all anyone really needs right?
I'm going to an amusement park tomorrow for the first time and I can hardly wait!
Busch Gardens in Williamsburg.  I have been studying up on what to do once I get there and it all looks amazing.  I don't know what to do first!
I am happy I have a home without a landlord and can do what I want_comma_ like rescue animals.
Any kind that needs help and happens to fall on my doorstep. I even feed all the wild critters I can :)
My family is visitng extended family in Canada. There's no one to come home to. Feels weird.
Yea. Think I'm finally gonna watch some horrors that my family are too afraid to watch.
I got caught by a train and it made me late for work
Maybe I should have said stopped by a train. Ha Ha.
I got irritated when my brother got in trouble at school. He knew better
He cheated a little
I just finished watching a series on netflix and now I am afraid to go outside alone in the dark.
documentary on serial killers
i felt bad when i forgot the day of my brothers birthday
i got him a present last minute

im so happy today.  I just passed a really important test.
Yeah I did actually.  I studied for three days non stop.
Just adopted a dog. We're gonna pick the little guy up this weekend.
It's a jack russell terrier!
I felt bad when I skipped work when I was not sick. I just lied about it
I was hungover
My wife is at the doctor's_comma_ and I think we might be getting good news about a new addition to our little family.
Oh we don't know yet! I hope it's not just a tummy ache she's having.
I had food_comma_ water_comma_ and a place to sleep today. I am so thankful.
I agree. I try to not take anything for granted and appreciate life more.
I have a court date next week and I don't know what's going to happen.  I really want custody of my kids.
It really is.  The 'opposition' really hates me so she is trying to keep from them.
My friend recently renovated her kitchen and I was so envious because I've been dreaming about remodeling my own for years.
That's true! I never looked at it that way!
I am hoping to become an English teacher but I am waiting on test results to come back.
Thank you.  I am very eager and anxious to see how well I did.
I bought everything I needed for the camping trip. I was not going to forget anything at all
I agree. One time I forgot bug spray and it was awful.
I haven't watched a horror in so long_comma_ but my friend wants to watch one
I'm terrified lol_comma_ but I don't want to tell her no.
Well I find a new organic lip stick brand and found it for a good price and I am really happy to get it in the mail and try it!
It  is a mauve. Lipstick queen! I can't always afford much so it's always nice when I can afford lipstick lol! especially a healthy kind.
So_comma_ I'm dog-sitting for my neighbor right now while she's out of town_comma_ and one of them isn't acting right. They're not eating_comma_ and they seem all morose. I think I might have to take it to the vet...
Not for another week! And the worst part is I know I have to tell her_comma_ but how do I tell her without her freaking out_comma_ you know? I don't want her to think it was my fault.
Thanks_comma_ I really appreciate that! We'll see how it goes. It's only been two days. Hopefully it's nothing.
Someone broke into my car last night.
It was locked. They broke the window and stole all my change and my son's birthday present that was in the trunk.
I can't believe I found a 20 dollar bill outside my house. It was not expected at all.
Nope_comma_ it's still in my wallet. I like to keep in the same small pocket that has a four-leafed clover because I think it was such a lucky find!
I went for a walk yesterday and stepped in some dog poop_comma_ gross.
It was fresh I think_comma_ I was wearing flip-flops too.
I got a new job_comma_ but I'm going to finish this last project with my current job before leaving.
An expedition? Do you mean a trip or car?
This one is acting weird.
Well I hope things work out for you anyway lol
No problem!
I finished my kids birthday candy tonight after they went to bed. I know there going to be mad in the morning and I feel bad about it.
Hahahaha.  That's pretty good.  The problem is this candy is very special.  One of their friends sent it over from Europe_comma_ so I can't just run down to 7-11 to buy some more.
I spilled my coffee on my keyboard and now it's sticky. I am so furious!
I mean_comma_ it still works. But all the buttons are sticky and double clicking. I'm so mad at myself...
I am very hopeful and excited about moving away from a very rough city and moving to a farm.
yes! I would love to rescue farm animals. I already have one in the bathtub! lol! Our duck- He'd like a farm too
I took my finals exam last week. I am optimistic about the results but we shall see.
Yes I agree_comma_ I studied hard for it. It will make or break me.
I was at a retail store and was ignored by the cashier who was checking me out.
No_comma_ she was just incompetent.
My kid came home with straight A's!
I am very proud. She is such a great kid. I just wanted her to do her best. Doesn't really matter she gets straight A's or not.
My power went out over three or four times today.  I lost count.
No they are doing work in the neighborhood.  Im glad I had my old hurricane supplies_comma_ batteries_comma_ etc.  I couldn't see anything.
MY take out order today was terrible.
McDonalds. I shouldve expected it. They don't get your order right in person.
IT's either really good. Or terrible
I worked on this project for so long_comma_ but it turns out my job doesn't even want it done anymore.
it does. I feel like it was a waste of my time_comma_ but at least I got paid for the hours.
Man_comma_ that would be awesome!
We're going to Thailand for the summer. Pretty sure I know the language enough to guide us.
I'm self taught actually. An hour everyday for a year now.
I made a list of everything I needed for my college dorm. Hopefully I am ready and didn't forget anything.
Yes_comma_ I am excited. I don't know what to expect honestly.
I was shocked when my dad got me a new car. I had no idea
I was starting my senior year_comma_ so it was for that I guess
My husband had been putting in so many extra hours at work and working so hard on projects for his boss.
Yes it was!! He finally got a promotion! We are so thrilled!
I am very angry at the person who bred_comma_ starved and then abandoned (or maybe she broke free) the dog I have.
I don't either! They would have to be something very wrong as I couldn't imagine hurting an innocent!
I made a list of what to bring to the waterpark. Hopefully_comma_ I am ready and didn't forget anything.
Yep! I forgot sunscreen last time and the sunburns were awful...not again this time!
My neighbor brought home her baby and it was her first child.
Fat little old lady. I tried to help her even though she had been mean and accused me of hitting her car when I didn't
Lol. She moved away. She thought I wanted her jobless boyfriend. No thanks
Lol. He didn't even have that.
I was recently rewarded at work for my loyalty and dedication to the company.
I was thankful that they recognized my contributions for all these years.
So_comma_ my computer monitor just died_comma_ and I was stressing about having to buy another one. But somehow my brother pulled out his toolkit and fixed it. I have no idea how people can be so handy!
I don't know... That's why I was worried about the monitor--I don't have a lot of money to begin with. So_comma_ I have to think of something free but thoughtful
Summer is almost over. I can't take it!
The fall weather is nice_comma_ but there is so much more free time in summer. I miss it every time it leaves
now school is about to start. I just want to die.
I littered out my car window today_comma_ I am so remorseful...
I'm sorry Earth!! I usually don't litter but it was so convenient at the time. I feel terrible
I was confident my brother was going to finish college. He was doing so well in his major
He aced a few tests and just seemed to be doing well
I bought a very difficult puzzle from my local hobby store_comma_ spent hours on building it only to drop it when I was about to put it in a frame. I was so dumbfounded
Thank you. I will be more careful next time_comma_ that is for sure.
I was sickened when my friend got fired. They did not like that she was gay apparently
A rural county got away with it for a week_comma_ then it went bad for them
My friend bought a winning lottery ticket for $2_comma_500 yesterday. Kind of annoyed since I know he's just going to blow it all on alcohol. I'd prefer if I could have it so I could use it to pay my rent.
Yeah_comma_ he goes through money fast because his parents spot him for cash no matter what. I get that it's their money_comma_ they can do whatever_comma_ and that I should be able to support myself. But it's hard to see people be so careless when I'm struggling over here.
My car was damaged in the parking lot and the other driver took off without leaving me a note.
No and its a brand new car.  The cop said I was at fault since I was illegally parked.
My husband is out of town and my friends talked me into going to a scary movie with them the other night.
I don't remember the name_comma_ but I have not been able to sleep since then. I hate being home alone!
My mother is sick in the hospital. I am optimistic she will make it through
Thank you_comma_ I am trying to see a positive out of this.
I went to a new pizza place downtown. They have one of those wood fire ovens.
I didn't order anything a mouse ran out of the kitchen and scared me to death.
I didn't think that movie was cute at all. I don't want a rat making my pizza lol
Whenever I see a happy couple_comma_ I get so envious..
I've been single for a while now :(
MY sister used to live in the apartment next door to me. She was my only friend in the complex.
Now I keep getting random neighbors who get evicted after two months.
Her husband lost his job and they couldnt afford it.
Whenever I see a happy couple_comma_ I get so envious...
I mean_comma_ I'm not ugly but it's been hard.
My cousin is coming to town for a week and has to stay with us. I am not looking forward to it.
She is no fun to be around. All she does is get drunk and act really crazy.
I had my first real Italian restaurant experience today.
I took my daughter. It was really good. Olive Garden is good but this place was great.
Just doing something nice before school starts.
Found out that I apparently filed my taxes wrong a few months ago_comma_ and now they want me to make up for what I should have paid_comma_ plus interest. I should have paid more attention or asked for help from someone I guess
Yeah_comma_ so does my mom. But that costs money. I was trying to be frugal and just used a free service. But I do a lot of self-employed work and I guess I didn't correctly account for all of the funds I earned over the past year. 
Yeah_comma_ they will. It's still extra money that I don't have. Oh well_comma_ my fault_comma_ have to pay the consequences.
I can't believe I won 50 bucks on the lottery ticket I just bought. Did not expect it.
I was thinking about upgrading the graphics card on my computer
My father in law is coming to visit for a whole week and staying at our house!
Not long enough! I am totally dreading it. He does not like me and he is so rude.
I feel like vomiting when I walk into a public restroom and it smells like manure. Some people haven't had a gram of fiber in their life
I know right? What's worse is when people pee all over the rim or ground
I was glad my dad showed me how to change a tire when I was young. It came in handy down the line
You can learn eventually
I was proud of my brother when he finished school. He worked so hard at it
It was English
I can't believe I actually lost that much weight. It's only been 2 months
20 lbs but I've got more to go. I am serious about this
My ex is the worst.
He posted my number on facebook.
He is immature and upset because I'm done.
I can't believe how big my dog has gotten. 7 months ago_comma_ she was a small_comma_ clueless puppy but now she is a big one!
Pinky because she has pink spots all over her nose and paws!
I ate an entire pepperoni pizza yesterday. That is not a part of my diet.
That was a big slip. I don't even know why I ordered it. I was the only one home.
I don't know if I can. I love food!
I made an elaborate dinner for my Moms birthday to show my appreciation for her
I wanted to show my feelings for her with the food. I think I was able to do it by making all of her favorites.
My brother is in the hospital and is very sick. I am very scared
He has had heart problems his whole life_comma_ I hope he will make it through
MY daughter is always glued to her phone.
50% of the time. It's annoying because I tell her something and thirty minutes later she asks what I said.
13. I'm doomed lol
I gave a pretty big loan to my mother in law. Today_comma_ she paid it back and I didn't expect her to. She is very hones
Yeah_comma_ I honestly didn't expect her to pay it back. My level of trust with her has rose for sure
I just saw the trailer for Black Ops 4 and preordered it immediately!
Yep I get it every year. Thw last one was WWII and it was pretty good.
I have no idea what Steam is. I have an XB1
I could not wait to go to my aunts house. She was going to make my favorite dish
A nice seafood gumbo
I haven't been in a relationship for a while now. I am so alone..
Thanks_comma_ but it's so discouraging seeing happy couples everywhere
My daughter made a nice dinner tonight and she is only 13
It was just a black bean dip that I make sometimes_comma_ but I never let her in the kitchen alone. Im too afraid.
I was afraid of her using the stove too. But It was really good. No leftovers.
I had a physics exam last week. Never felt so good going into one before.
I did pretty well on it! All my studying seemed to pay off.
My mom takes care of me so much. I feel like she is Mother Teresa!
I agree. I am so thankful
I don't have a laundry washer or dryer in my apartment. So my mom comes by every week and picks up my smelly clothes. I am very thankful for her.
I agree. She is very helpful
I definitely over-ate today. I'm not overweight_comma_ but I do want to lose like five pounds. I also want to have positive eating habits. But eating vegetables is so uninteresting to me...
Yeah_comma_ I hear of people doing that. And that's a useful tip. But I think you lose some nutrition that way_comma_ right? Besides_comma_ I'm too lazy to do it. 
I ate way too much today. I feel like I let myself down.
It really sucks because I promised myself on Sunday that I would eat more healthy and less. But I already broke that promise_comma_ I am ashamed.
I hate storms so much. We are supposed to be getting bad storms tonight.
But until then I don't think I will be getting any sleep.
I couldn't believe it when a rock bounced off the car in front of me and cracked my windshield. I am so frustrated at the moment.
That's a good idea_comma_ I will do that first thing tomorrow morning.
I can't wait! I am going on a vacation to Rome_comma_ Italy in a couple weeks!
I will be visiting all of the old historic Roman sites!  I am a huge history buff and have wanted to visit there for the longest time!
I can't wait for the new evil Spiderman movie called Venom. It's going to be sick!!!
I love Tom Hardy too! First Bane_comma_ now evil Spiderman! Can't wait
Just relaxing here with a cold Dr. Pepper after a long day of work and a hot shower. It doesn't get much better than feeling the air conditioner breeze flowing on your clean body_comma_ feeling accomplished.
I'm a landscaper. It's kind of rough work at times_comma_ but it's rewarding to see your vision come together_comma_ especially when you have to work with a big team to get it done.
I posted a party on social media this morning. Not single soul showed up and I am alone...again
I didn't invite anyone in particular but it was a message to everyone on my followers list. 
Black Ops 4 comes out in October
I know right. October 12th. I just pre ordered it. Im sad because its still so far away.
The beta is next moth august so maybe I'kk see you there.
Stephen Kings new show is so scary.
It about a man that they found locked in a cage in prison and he may be the devil.
It is. And its scary lol
Last christmas i got a car!
Its a red one! My uncle bought it for me!
Ughh_comma_ 1900uncleray. He is the best.
You ever revisit a place and wonder_comma_ since you hadn't been there in so long_comma_ where the time went?
Yeah_comma_ I agree. I was visiting my parents_comma_ in my old neighborhood where I grew up_comma_ and I went back to the public basketball court the neighborhood. Just makes me wish I could be a kid again.
The new movie I just saw was not great. I expected so much more.
It's ok. I bought tickets during matinee hours so it wasn't too bad. Yes_comma_ the popcorn was good as always. 
My wife just bought me a car for our anniversary_comma_ and I am so happy she did.
A new SUV I've had my eye on.  I really wasn't expecting it_comma_ but she said 30 years is a big anniversary.
A girl I asked out just rejected me. Feels bad man.
Thanks_comma_ it was so weird because she showed signs of interest. But she gave me the Nope.
Christmas eve is the worst day for me every year.
I just want it to be christmas so badly then.
I got a speeding ticket today on my way back from work. I did not believe it so I tried to argue with the cop_comma_ still got the the ticket.
Yes_comma_ I will try to fight it in court. That was just wrong to ticket me for going 32 in a 30 plus I was going down a hill.
My co-worker managed to grab the promotion that I was gunning for all year long.
I have - I was so jealous. Well_comma_ maybe if I work hard over the next year I'll manage to get it.
It makes me sad that there is only one season left of game of thrones. They could have made 2
IT si the best show every created!
Lol. The nudity and things are few and far between now. It used to be a lot though lol
I found an old playlist on my phone today. It was like reliving a moment in my life.
It was very nostalgic
Yesterday_comma_ I saw a dead possum in the road on my way home from work.
Oh_comma_ no I'm sure he was dead. Made me think of all the times I had to nab up all that sweet_comma_ savory roadkill a few years back to fill up my empty stomach. Times were tough.
I've been studying for my test this Friday. I think I am ready for it.
Economics_comma_ it's my favorite subject so I'm very passionate about it!
I kept raising my hand in class in my lecture the other day and the teacher wouldn't pick on me.
I'm not sure. Maybe it was because I usually answer all the question. I felt quite peeved.
It makes me depressed seeing homeless people. I wish I could help them but I am going through tough times too.
Thank you. I always try to give them a few coins here and there. Maybe even a few bucks.
I got a brand new computer last month!
It's something brand new_comma_ and it works very fast.
I Think my husband is cheating but I'm scared to investigate.
What if it true and I murder him in his sleep?
I'll think about it.
I have a math test tomorrow and it is the biggest one of the semester.
I've been studying all night. It's going to be a real doozy. I am quite nervous!
When I was a child I was in a destructive tornado.
No luckily my family was safe. Two girls down the street got killed. 
I hate it when I get ignored. It makes me feel less human and I get very mad!
I try to tell myself there are other people out there that care about what I have to say
I really like this girl at my job_comma_ but I am sort of nervous to ask her out. I am not very confident when it comes to those types of social situations.
Yeah_comma_ I need to just hype myself up and get it over with.  My coworkers already tell me that she asks about me.
My cousin got accepted into Med school and I am very envious! I wish it was me...
Yes_comma_ I applied but have been rejected as always. Maybe I need to try a new career field.
So_comma_ I found this new recipe for mayonnaise lasagna. I'm making it tomorrow for all my fellow workers in the Nike sweatshop.
Oh_comma_ very. But I am sure it will make a tasty meal for all my starving comrades. Even throwing a rat I found in the alley in there. Should be scrumptious! 
Tomorrow I am going to a Nascar race with my family. I can't wait to see all the hillbillies and neckbeards throwing down in the bleachers.
Eh_comma_ if you live on a hill and your name is Bill_comma_ I think that would qualify you as a hillbilly.
My friends planned a surprise party for my birthday.
Yes. I got quite a few items I collect. They know me very well. 
I went out and bought a lottery ticket last thursday.
Of course I did not_comma_ I will always try.
My friend just died last week. I went over to her house to help sort her stuff.
Yeah. It was actually nice to look through all her old photo albums from our fun times together.
I used to be pretty buff a couple years back. That gives me inspiration that I can get back to that shape again.
We got this! We just need to be disciplined and eat healthy!
So_comma_ I've been practicing holding my breath for a few months now.
Nope. Just a regular Joe-Schmo that wants to break a world record. Never felt so prepared.
There is a thunderstorm going on right now_comma_ and my neighbors dogs that I'm dog-sitting keep barking every time it thunders! They're really starting to get on my nerves. Not sure how much longer I can stand it.
Yeah_comma_ I get that. You just figure they'd realize after the 17th boom of thunder that they'd think_comma_ "Okay_comma_ maybe it's not something to worry about." Oh well_comma_ I'm probably just expecting too much from them.
I forgot to feed my dog this morning. She was acting very aggressive and I didn't know what was wrong at first then it hit me. I knew it was my fault on why she was so rowdy!
I felt so guilty afterwards and I know she hated me for it. 
I picked up this aardvark on the black market. Named him Arthur. He pooped all over my carpet yesterday.
It's an exotic animal that lives in the rain forests of South America. I was so annoyed because he made quite a mess. Probably explains why rain forests are so fertile.
I have to go to court soon for a drunk driving incident and I am so scared. What if I have to go to jail?
It's my 2nd offense so I am terrified. I think I'm looking at a month or two in jail.
My mother is litltle sick lately. So I bought her an unexpected gift.
Yes_comma_ I bought her ipad. She was happy that I thought of buying her something.
So_comma_ I took a big ole dookey in the bathroom at work today. Forgot to flush the toilet on the way out.
You're telling me. I felt really bad whoever had to use it next. I really blew that thing up. Shouldn't have had Taco Bell last night!
MY family got together and built my grandma a gazebo for her birthday.
I did a little painting. I don't build things.
Treat them well and they will.
I interviewed at my job for a promotion. I knew I was the top candidate.
Yes I did. But I knew I would.I am the top worker. 
Yesterday_comma_ I forgot to flush the toilet at work. The look of disgust on my co-worker's face who just walked out was priceless.
Oh_comma_ it was mega embarrassing! My co-workers wouldn't stop talking about it. I'm sure they're never going to let me live it down.
My brother last month got a brand new computer.
Something that is super fast_comma_ I really wish I would have gotten one.
We just go through selling my grandmothers house last month.
It went well_comma_ but I am gonna miss that farm house. We have a lot of memories of that ole place.
My internet service provider cut my internet last week. I was shocked because I didn't miss the payment so I knew it had to be an error.
I think it was an error on their part or the payment delayed. I even paid earlier than the due date because this has happened in the past. Maybe it's time to switch companies.
I was afraid when my kids were out of town without me
They are 13 and 10
I was very interested in a girl that lives near me. I can't seem to muster the courage to talk to her so I'm feeling pretty down in the dumps. Hopefully_comma_ one day I can let my mind stop racing and just go for it.
Probably nothing but it's still hard to go through with it. I need to man up...
MY kids just won't go to sleep at night.
They going to have sore bottoms soon. I can't stand it.
They will wish they got more sleep when they are older. Just like me now.
I remember being really upset when we had to move away from my very first best friend when I was 10"
It is really tough at that age too
I spent more time than usual grooming my dog. She was so appreciative and you could see how much she loved it!
For sure_comma_ but she knew something was up because I never spend more than 30 minutes grooming her lol. She was like "what is your evil plan master"
I had to pay a late fee on my car taxes because I procrastinated in paying them on time. I always put off important things because I feel too scared to do them for some reason. Not sure why I keep making the same mistakes
Well_comma_ I hate seeing my money go away_comma_ too. So I put it off_comma_ thinking it will help things_comma_ especially when I'm so down to the wire on my money. But then I just end up making it worse for myself.
I missed the payment for my utility bill but I'm optimistic about the situation. Hopefully they don't cut my electr
I agree_comma_ I love the internet which requires electricity. I need to get priorities straight!
I quit smoking maybe twice a month. I want to quit for forever.
I know. I can't make it a whole day though.
I keep trying. I might need to try medication.
My dogs are my entire world.
My dogs keep me sane.
Kind of scared to file for my financial aid this year. Not sure if it will cover all my expenses for the semester. If it doesn't_comma_ I don't know how I'll make ends meet and attend school.
I wish. That was my first thought_comma_ but I just can't make it work_comma_ time-wise. I major in social work_comma_ and an internship is mandatory_comma_ and that's a part-time job in itself.
I really don't want to. But I might have to. I'm scared of going into even more debt_comma_ since I already have student loans. We'll see what my options are after I talk to my family.
I am wishing the Yankees will win the World Series.
Yes_comma_ I do not like the Red Sox.
I lost a friend to throat cancer last year.

5-14
I know that Trump will win reeelction.
Sad? I am so happy_comma_ I love him.
My brother just got a new job_comma_ and he and his family are moving into a bigger house in a nicer city. Kind of wish I had his success right now_comma_ but I'm struggling to remain proud of him too. I don't want to make it all about me.
He's excited_comma_ of course. But I'm sure he's nervous_comma_ too. I watched him during the job search process--it took a while. So I know he's relieved_comma_ which I'm happy about_comma_ too.
Every single thanksgiving_comma_ I eat alone.
They all died when i was much younger.
My little sister caught off a chunk of my hair when I was sleeping last night. She did it because I came up with a fun but mean nickname for her the day before. But that was way over the line!
No_comma_ because I didn't want to escalate it further. My parents punished her_comma_ but I felt like she got off lightly. All she got was being grounded for a week and her phone taken away for that same time period. Oh well.
I do not like being around bats.
Yes_comma_ once when I was trapped in a cave.
Someone spray-painted my car last night_comma_ wrote some curse word. I have no idea why_comma_ since i have no enemies. I don't understand how people can treat others like that.
Yeah_comma_ there's no making sense of it. But now I have to go out of my budget to fix this mistake when it shouldn't have been my problem in the first place. And I have no one to take my anger out on or to get justice from. I didn't even bother calling the police.
MY son always tries to unlock my ipad while I'm sleep. Now it has to be reset
He's three and he has his on that's why I keep mines locked. I am so mad at him.
ME too. I'm gonna have to hide it now.
I was nervous when I was trying to drive where I wasn't familiar
No_comma_ I was used to driving_comma_ just going somewhere I had not before
I am so mad Hillary Clinton didn't go to jail.
No_comma_ he never breaks the law just takes advantage of it.
I pray every night North Korea doesn't bomb us.
I hope your right.
I moved away from the city. I never see my friends anymore. It gets lonely out here.
It's better for my kids and its so expensive.
The people out here aren't that friendly. I can't win.
I forgot to order my daughters textbooks.
She starts on the 13th. She wont get the books until the 17th. I'm s bad mom lol
I waited so late some were on back order. I couldn't afford the other ones. I explained to the school though. I'm just embarrassed
I wish I had more money like Bill Gates.
Maybe I can start the next Microsoft.
I am really impressed that I am still able to teach my dog things at his age
He is 14!
I am so happy school is back.
Yes_comma_ but I am a teacher.
Last week_comma_ I had my credit card application approved with American Express. I now can think of getting a new smartphone
I was thinking of getting Samsung S9 which costs around $700 and thought of paying with my Amex credit card
I lost my dog last year_comma_ I cried so hard.
No_comma_ I assume he died.
Im so happy I gt to take my kids on two trip this summer since I started working.

After my divorce I have no one.
Where do I go to meet them?
I was ecstatic when my kids came home yesterday
They were on vacation with their father
I hate taking the subway_comma_ I am afraid I will get robbed.
Cause it seems to happen every day.
I was really annoyed when my boss was not being treated well
I do.  He is really encouraging
I recently broke my favorite coffee mug that my grandmother gave me before she passed away.
No_comma_ it's completely shattered. I'm pretty upset. 
Thanks. I guess I need to just cherish her memory and try not to put too much emotion into material things.
When I was jogging two days ago_comma_ I fell flat on my face after tripping over my feet. Someone saw me and I felt so stupid. I turned around_comma_ looked at them_comma_ and said_comma_ "You didn't see that_comma_" and then just kept on jogging.
I have some scrapes on my hands where I landed. But mostly it was just my pride that was injured. I hope I never see that person around the neighborhood again...
Probably. And you're right_comma_ yeah_comma_ I'm overthinking it. But I keep replaying it over and over in my head! I'm sure after another day or two it'll be gone.
I cry every time I think of my grandmother.
I am just sad she isn't alive anymore.
I just stubbed my toe a few minutes ago. Why does that have to even be a thing? Something so small on your body can cause you such great pain_comma_ and all you can do is just hop around like a moron.
That's actually a really interesting way to frame it. We try hard to survive because we know how fragile we are as a species. If we weren't so fragile_comma_ we'd take it for granted. Interesting perspective!
I felt very special and appreciated when my supervisor praised my work in front of other team members during our weekly meeting
We develop enterprise software solutions for business per client request_comma_ and i was able to create a very efficient algorithm
I saw someone eat a five pound burger during some crazy challenge earlier today. It was a girl_comma_ too! Sometimes people do some wild things to completely turn around your expectations of them.
Yeah_comma_ no joke. And she seemed fine afterwards_comma_ too. Like walking around normal_comma_ no pain. This girl had to be like 115_comma_ tops. Really funny.
Two of my best friends moved away recently not far apart from one another. Left me feeling a bit empty.
Oh yeah_comma_ knowing that they left for positive reasons and having social media to keep in contact helps a lot.
How come you guys don't use social media? I guess I kind of get it_comma_ but I feel in your case it could be a huge positive!
Well that's good. Skype is actually even better than having to deal with all the extra nastiness of social media.
I was really embarrassed when I forgot my speech
It was for work
I moved to a new city and have no friends.
Yes but I do not know where to go.
My sister just had a baby two days ago! It's been pretty hectic_comma_ and while I'm not looking forward to having to help with diapers_comma_ I'm proud of her and happy that she's healthy.
Yeah_comma_ I'm just going to try to be as helpful as I can. But I also can only stand so much. Newborns are hard. I haven't had my own yet. What about you? Do you have any kids?
My wife and I have been together for about 14 years now and I feel we still have a great relationship.
We met through a mutual friend when we were pretty young. I believe I was around 15 years old.
I can't wait for my birthday
I will definitely make sure of that!
A while back_comma_ we got a new guy at our office_comma_ and of course he always picks my counter to sit at.
I don't know_comma_ but I even have pictures of my cat and some Funko Pops at that desk_comma_ and the one next to me is never used.
No way_comma_ he already has two wives (seriously)_comma_ and he's definitely not into guys.
I love doing surveys and making money.
Sometimes I have a hard time finding work to do or finding someone to work with. It can drive me crazy.
I saw a kitten get run over by a car.
I am not sure as I could not stop because of all the traffic.
The ONE time I had my security camera off_comma_ someone stole my lawn mower!
I use these new wireless cameras that need to be taken down and charged every so often. I should have charged it while I was home!
Yeah_comma_ I'm really pissed. I guess I should be mad at myself too_comma_ it doesn't make sense to charge it when you need it!
One time I was speeding_comma_ and another person was too. A cop pulled out behind me and luckily zoomed past me to chase after the other speeder. I felt like someone was looking down on me that day since I didn't get a ticket.
Yeah_comma_ immediately. But my luck ran out like a week later_comma_ because then I got ticketed for speeding in some lame speed trap. Karma_comma_ I guess. Ever since then I've played it pretty safe and used it as a learning lesson.
This Spring Break we decided to Ski Resort in Colorado with my college friends. It was truly special and full of exciting experiences
It was my first time skiing in my entire life. I realized how much there are things that I should try doing
I can not believe the summer is almost over.
Yes_comma_ and winter is close.
I feel bad I didn't go to work today.
I wanted to go to the Yankee game.
I am so hopeful for a bright future
To be a happy and fulfilled person
Hi friend_comma_ I'm pretty upset right now.
Well my neighbor's dog just had puppies. All of the dogs are really malnourished. It's infuriating to see this happening and not knowing what to do.
I think so but the animal shelter will kill them.
I gave my dog a new food he had never tried before and he ended up puking all over my house.
He's perfectly find_comma_ but man was it gross! 
I'm really not sure_comma_ but he's definitely not having it anymore! Almost made me puke when I saw his puke all over the house!
I felt really guilty when I had to leave my dog home alone for the first time
He was by himself while I was at work
I am honored I get to visit China next year.
I am going for a student exchange program.
I was shocked the US didn't qualify for the World Cup.
They did not have a good coach.
I'm a little saddened to hear my state came last in education.
Won't surprise you_comma_ but it's Louisiana.
Well people often make jokes about people from the south not being very bright! I guess the jokes aren't too far from the truth.
Yesterday_comma_ i passed by a library which me and my ex-partner used to visit frequently when in college. I felt like I truly missed those times
Indeed. Nostalgia is one of the factors that drives my anxiety and depression to a certain degree
A friend of mine lost 200 pounds in one year. It was amazing to witness!
Oh yes! He never lost motivation through the entire process.
It's really not as hard as it seems. All you have to do is cut your calories down a bit_comma_ you don't even need to change the foods you eat!
I visited New York last weekend_comma_ I was amazed.
I saw Times Square. It was awesome.
I wish I can get the part I want

My dog ran away today. What kind of pet did you have as a kid?

The day my daughter was born was the happiest day of my life

I found a nice pair of jeans at the store that fit just right.
Everything worked out just fine.

Yes. And I had to go all the way down to the office to pay. Couldnt even pay over the phone. And Im goin to have to pay an extra 40 next month. smh
When I think about happiness_comma_ the first thing that comes to mind is the overwhelming sense of bliss when my daughter was born.
Thanks! What is a joyful moment in your life?
I decided to clean out my drawers today and found my old toys from when I was younger. They brought back happy memories.
That is a good idea. Old memories that you remember tend to be ones you are really fond of.
My college friend called me and asked if we could have a double date dinner with my and his partner. I do not know why but my partner refused
She just told me that she felt uncomfortable by having a dinner with another couple. That is totally something new that I learned about her
How can people eat human flesh?
I could never ever do it!
I had to do a presentation for school. I researched the subject and was certain that I had all my facts in order
I wasn't nervous because I was so sure of myself.
I remember as a kid when I was mad I would try to break something my parents owned. Looking back_comma_ I feel remorse for what I did.
I would just try to break a household item whenever they punished me. Yes it is different now_comma_ I try to control my temper in non violent ways.
They would be very mad_comma_ but I am sure they have forgiven me by now.
I got a new puppy yesterday!
It's the most cute_comma_ it's so small
I was mortified when my jeans ripped
When did you have that happen?
I bought a lottery ticket and won a prize. I never win so this was unexpected
I could not help myself I told everyone.
Everyday I remind myself of how lucky I am to have a pair of supportive parents.
Yes_comma_ good parents are needed in order to successfully raise a child.
For sure_comma_ extended family can help with that!
It is nice to have a roof over my head
It is sad.  I would like to be a part of the change with that
I had a job interview. Everything went great and I just knew the job was mine.
That's just it_comma_ I didn't get it. It went to someone that I'm sure is less qualified. It was quite upsetting.
My daughter was born in January so the Christmas before she was born I had to spend alone since I was too close to her due date to travel to my family.
Yes you see my family lives across the country from me
I was a little put off when I was passed over for the promotion
No just the usual responses that don't offer useful feedback
Another friend of mine followed through what they said they would do. They usually don't.
This is not something that is normal for them. But this made me look at them in another way.
Am waiting for my interview results which I did yesterday.
Me too. but we can't skip this process to get job. 
I let my dad borrow 10 dollars!
Not for me_comma_ but dad always need money and I give to him.

Last weekend_comma_ I invited my friend over and we played FIFA on PS4. I won against him with a large score
I know. I felt very superior when beating him on this game with great performance
I hate losing!
I lose at everything I do it seems.
I watched a news report about the mistreatment of animals. The behavior of these people is something I can't stand
I hope that the punishment they receive will be a warning for others.
I loved going to the diner where I grew up
It is not unfortunately
I had to make an out of town trip on a unfamiliar road. I was a little uneasy about it.
I was not alone. Once I got out of town it was really easy. I don't know what I was so worried about.
We dont have a fence but I know my dog will stay in the yard
He is such a good dog though
I was switching around the tv channels and came across a show from my childhood. It really brought back some memories. 
It was on one of the channels that shows old shows. I had not seen it in years.
I was really scared when I walked to my car after the movie
It was after a horror movie
I worked really hard on a project at work and earned a bonus. It made me feel really good about myself
It was something that the company had been working on for quite awhile. I was the one that came up with the solution.
I think Ive seen every show on Netflix. Im waiting for something really good.
OITNB just got a new season. Ive watched it already.
It is. They get lots of awards.
I was really broken up when we had to put our family dog to sleep

Doesnt appeal to me either. Ive been.
I ran into a friend that I had not seen in years. We had a lot of catching up to do
Time changes all of us. But it was fun to think about the old times.
Gradating high school was the best day of my life.
Of course not_comma_ i went straight to sleep!
MY kid loves her new school and she doesnt like anything!
I said nothing about tv
She likes school because she met a bunch of kids that like anime.
Ok. Thank me later
I was a little on the fence about letting my daughter go to a party
I didn't know the parents well
I remember the first day of my first job 17 years ago.
I worked in the food court at the airport.
Cool. It was a sweet gig.
I made an Apple pie to take to a dinner but then I ate the whole thing. I didn't bring anything to the dinner.
I felt so bad for not bringing anything.
MY daughter and I talk about everything. We are close.
I hope it lasts she is still a teen.
She is special. I think she will stay this way.
I know this upcoming electionis going to change the state of our union.
I'm not worried. Im optimistic.
I wish more people were positive. Dont you?
I was trying to explain something to someone and they cut me off and would not listen
It is something that can be hard to deal with.
I have my list all ready for the grocery store tomorrow.
Things for the kids lunches. They all like different stuff.
Three. Four if you count my neice. I help out with her too.
I have the flat to myself today

They are fast and sneaky and I think one is in my kitchen
I'm too scared. Im going to call someone to do it.
I'm looking for a new job.
A few. None at Rentokill - so I can't solve your problems :-)
I'm sure I'll get one sooner or later.
My ex boyfriend just won't move on. Its sad
I don't think he's dangerous. He just always want to talk about the past or getting back together. Im not interested.
I have to we have a kid. Just didnt work out.
I was at work and heard gossip about a coworker. I didn't say anything in their defense
We aren't really friends but I don't think what was said is true.
My old job was the best. I miss it.
It was fun. I liked my coworkers. And I got good discounts on clothes.
I dont like shopping in that store anymore now.
I had so many bad dates recently. I just know my next one is gonna be great.
I told a guy I was afraid of zombies and he laughed so hard I just wanted to go home.
I know I will. No where to go but up!
I'm looking forward to the new football season starting!
Yeah - I co-own a team in Spain so I can access video of them preparing.
Yeah - sorry_comma_ should have explained that. I forget that in America you don't sue the right name :-)
I'm moving to New York soon.
I think I can make it there. Its never too lare.
I think so too.
I watched a movie that looked really good on the trailer but I didn't like it at all
I don't want to say because I feel like everybody should judge for themselves. 
U despise people who wear Jordans. Ive never had a pair.
I wouldnt spend that much on a pair of shoes_comma_ but I would like to say that I could at least
Its crazy right?
I definitely am!
My biggest skill is being able to bake bread.
It's actually pretty straight forward when you know how. It's a good skill to have as it means you can make something from very cheap ingredients.
You should - there are loads of recipes online and it tastes so much better than store bought
I like to make ciabatta - but it's difficult as the dough is very wet and sticky
Im pretty happy with my new job.
Thanks. It doesnt pay much_comma_ but it helps people.
It rewarding
My daughter is still up asking me for snacks. It is 3 am
No. She just doesnt want to go to bed_comma_
She asked for some butter

No problem - it's not everyone's cup of tea
I can't wait until the football season starts! I am so pumped!
American football is what I am excited for.
I hide my snacks from my kids.
So I can have them all to myself of course.

Im still pretty cool with my ex.
We didnt end well but we moved past it.
Its nice.
Me too. Its workinf out so far
MY neighbors are seriously having a party in the middle of the week.
Right now.
3 15 even worse.
I used to be engaged.
It's a long story. Basically_comma_ I moved out without telling her. I was very immature then!
We all make mistakes. She has been married 4 times since then.
I think so. Now I travel alone through life!

It will happen eventualy
I was in the supermarket the other day. It was very busy and people were letting their kids run wild causing chaos!
It was irrational as I know they aren't doing it on purpose - but it made me really angry
My daughter got an F on an exm and hid it from me.
I have no idea. I dont trust anything she says now.
She shouldve been. Im serious about school
I do but I don't tolerate lying either. I dont lie to her.
Man you would believe what my family did for me on my birthday! Big bash waiting for me at home after a long day.
Yeah_comma_ they got me a cake from that bakery you recommended. Wonder who let them know it was my new favorite place for sweets.
So it was you! Honestly I shouldn't be surprised but I'm touched my family went so far as to get in contact with you.
Well that explains how you knew to reach out to my family. 
I have the worst mailman.
He doesnt always vlose the mailbox and the mai goes flying
I hate it
I can't understand why some people earn so much money.
Yeah - my old boss used to get more than double my wage_comma_ yet I couldn't see what he brought to the role to deserve that.
I think Im done with voting.
It seems pointless in my neighborhood.
They gave up on us first.
I just watched this horror film_comma_ it was so scary!
I know_comma_ I won't watch anymore of those.
You won't believe what I found when I went on my jog yesterday. A fallen baby bird just sitting on the sidewalk!

Well I mean what would you do in that situation? Couldn't just leave it there.
Wow_comma_ but come on its just a baby.
I cant believe my friend got engaged before I did.

I don't know_comma_ its weird just sitting at home and knowing she isn't here.
Well at least she is gone_comma_ I couldn't stand to look at her.
I love public speaking
Not really. I feel really confident. I just kind of go for it.
No. I just seem to be able to block out any fear mentally.
It never really happens - I think the adrenalin kicks in.
I was really embarrassed and disappointed 
Because the appointment  was cancelled 
Yes it was a very important appointment 
Do you watch Orange is the New Black? I was sad when I saw it.
Yeah - it's a bit like an old HBO show called Oz
Because of an ending - I don't want to spoil it for you though
I find people with extendable dog leads annoying.
It probably is better for the dog. But the owners aren't always responsible. Where I live they use them on the sidewalk and block off the whole area for other people walking.
I can't believe my dog just passed away.
I am so hurt right now.
I like sailing on yachts.
It is - especially in the sunshine
I am disgusted that so many people voted in favour of Brexit in the UK.

Hi! is it okay to be angry at a friend when he throws you to jail for absolutely nothing?
He lied about me assaulting him and it was just an argument really.

Anything can happen last minute_comma_so Its good to prepared ahead of time for things to go well
The people that bring more cabin luggage than expected in the airplane are making me angry.

Luckily it didn't end unhappily_comma_ the dog came back
Yeah_comma_ and it's even worse when it's not your dog
Did anything like that ever happen to you?
Are you in the US? We have a thing in the UK called Prime Minister's Question Time which is like a debate shown on TV of our parliament. It makes me very angry.
The politicians just spend the whole time shouting at each other and laughing at their own jokes. It's pathetic. You should youtube it.
They get paid either way.
Unfortunately_comma_ I forgot it was my wife's birthday yesterday!
I deserve it. I feel really bad about it!

NO problem.HAve you ever fell sad?
Do you recall something that makes you really sad?
Another thing that makes me sad is when someone is being racist. I saw someone being very obnoxious the other day and it was awful.
That's right_comma_ it makes me angry as well when someone is treated unfairly.
My birthday was last week.  It was a really upsetting day.  
I didnt get any presents.. no cards.. no nothing from anybody.

I am starting to help my cousin out in his garage. It's hard for him to find time to show me secretarial type things_comma_ so I've just jumped in and been doing it. I'm doing pretty well so far.

Thanks. Have to be to succeed_comma_ right?

I was driving on the freeway the other day and there was a car ahead of me that was swerving bad. This really bugs me but I had no where to go on the road other then to slow down and fall back to get away from that car.
Thank you. I really couldnt get too far away from the car but fortunately after several minutes of this we passed a state trooper who then pulled them over. I really wish people didnt drive so dangerously. 
I thought I would beat my brother at all the sports games on Nintendo Wii...until he kicked my butt at boxing_comma_ soccer_comma_ tennis_comma_ and volleyball. I hadn't expected that

I recently got in trouble for missing a lot of work. My supervisor had a talk with me and has decided to give me another chance to improve.
Yes I was appreciative of him doing that for me for sure.
I'm pretty self-assured in my capabilities.  But sometimes I fear the worst for the majority of my generation who would have no idea how to raise a family_comma_ profit from their own sweat and hard work_comma_ have an organic conversation_comma_ or let alone survive a World War 3.
Haha I don't consciously stress over it.  I was prompted to.  I just feel like Millenials should raise the bar in life a little bit. 
I'm a Millenial and I KNOW we can do better.  
I am so pissed off at my co-worker
He got the promotion I had my eye on.
I found some of my kids artwork from when they were little and it made me miss having them around all the time.
It is hard when they move away.
These people would hit your car and not even leave a not and say sorry or leave their insurance info
because they are losers
My dog decided to chew more than a few pieces of furniture while I was at work :(
Yup. I have to replace many items since he chewed them to bits. Crazy dog.
My brother is so spoiled! My parents get him the coolest birthday presents!
All I ever get is a card. The obviously like him better.

A name carries honor and I'm willing to kill for it
My power went out for 3 days last month_comma_ but I had gone out and gotten a generator right before.

She takes forever getting ready! I would rather take the bus.
My supervisor belittled me in front of all of my coworkers in a meeting.
Yes it was. I was furious and hurt. Leaders should not do that to their employees.
I had to speak at a meeting at work and spent a week drafting up my speech. Because of this I performed well.
Because it was a speech to our client about why they should stay with us. 
I'm looking to get my EP out on iTunes by mid-September...I'm sure people will like it_comma_ fingers crossed hoping I get some good exposure

My daughter was sick the other day and I couldn't afford to miss work. 
I sent her to daycare even though I probably shouldn't have. I would get fired if I stayed home though.
I was recently looking through old pictures and it made me feel weird. Like a longing for the past.
Yes_comma_ and pictures of old friends. 
Back then I was a big chicken and couldn't approach women_comma_ let alone get numbers.  But I discovered that the easiest way to overcome that irrational fear is to level with them like a friend_comma_ instead of seeing them as a prize to be won / objectified.
Very
My best friend called me up crying the other day. Her boyfriend is cheating on her.
Yes it definitely does. I feel for her.
I was watching Back to the Future yesterday with my family. Man_comma_ it brought back some good memories of growing up in the 80's.

It was miraculous that Philadelphia beat out New England in the Super Bowl!
I am now a huge Carson Wentz fan!

That's a great idea but I don't know where she lives
I had been studying so hard for a test and was very confident going in.
I did not pass. It was horrible!
I enjoy going to my Grandmother's house and helping out with chores and cleaning. If feels so good to help her out and make her comfortable.
I hope so.  I feel a strong sense of obligation to her since she was always there for me growing up.  Do it is the least I could do for her.
My brother moved to California a few days ago. It was stressful for him_comma_ but he's always been good at thinking things through

You are right

He was bad about this because of his grandparents they would always get him something and it made it hard for me to make him understand you done always get what you want 
Yes _comma_ when he was about 3 or 4 they would take care of him when I work nights _comma_ they were always buying something for him .I tried my best to tell them not to it just makes it hard on me to explain to him why I won't buy him toys .

My sister just got a huge promotion and her husband bought her a new house.
Eh_comma_ I don't care. I'm bitter about it
I had to sit with a dying dog at the rescue today.   It was sad but I felt like he deserved to be loved on before he passed away

Yes it does.  I hope you have a great day
My brother got to argue a legal case in front of the supreme court. I was very proud.

I am astonish by Trump
His unpredictability.Every day is a new surprise.

I remember the first I got pooped on while changing my kids diapers.
They are 14 and 12.  It was pretty gross_comma_ but you have to deal with a lot of gross things when they are babies and just remember that you can take a shower to wash it off.  Luckily they have cute little faces to help you forget about the gross things.
I felt kind of irked when my friend kept bugging me for help.
I agreed to help him move but he kept asking about it even though I said yyes.
I heard in the news earlier today about a dog that was left locked in a crate on the ocean during rising tide.
I was sickened_comma_ but thankfully someone found it and rescued it!

I went to a birthday party for one of my friends kids_comma_ and a small boy asked me to get him a cookie from the table_comma_ so I got it for him. Little did I know_comma_ the boy was allergic to nuts!
His mouth kind of got red and his face swelled a little and he was really itchy around the face and neck. I felt so bad_comma_ I didn't think to ask or to check for allergies!
We sold our house last year and received above asking price_comma_ which was unexpected
Honestly_comma_ we paid off debt and a couple furnishings. The new house is very peaceful by comparison
My 6th birthday party was unexpected.  My mom had picked me up from school and said I needed to finish homework before I could open my present.  So I went to my room but when I turned on the lights all my friends from school were there hiding and shouted "SURPRISE".  We ditched homework and played games the rest of the night.
Definitely.  Aside from my 21st my birthdays have been a lot more low key since then lol
I am thinking about going back to school_comma_ but haven't decided yet.
I just don't know if I can handle the workload.

on her weight. I tried to help her stop eating junk food by getting healthy alternatives and cooking for us and I also registered us with a gym
My fiance gave our toddler juice boxes when I told him not to_comma_ simply because I knew he would make a mess. He gave him juice boxes anyway_comma_ and this morning I had to figure out how to clean up a sticky walls and tables and half of all his toys!
Well he's very inconsiderate when I am the one that has to clean up the mess. He could have just put it in a sippy cup instead. 
I had to be at home by myself for 2 days last week while my husband worked out of town. 
It was horrible and boring_comma_ but I'm hoping to take up a hobby soon so I can have something to do when he's away.

Indeed it does. Even more so when they don't give you a good reason other than 'I need more excitement in my life'
I'm generally a calm driver.  But what really agitates me--to the point of wanting to throw something at the other driver--is someone on the right side merging at full speed onto the main road I'm driving on_comma_ towards the furthest lane possible...with NO SIGNAL
Yes glad someone can relate.  A lot of crazy drivers down here in Texas haha
A while ago_comma_ I needed a place to stay for the weekend while my parents took a trip. I was lucky enough that my friend offered me to stay at his home with his family for the duration.
They do_comma_ my cooking skills were just lacking and my friend was aware of the situation and very helpful. I find it hard to ask for assistance at times but I'm comfortable with Bill because I've known him for years.

I felt it was intentional he can be a jerk sometimes. 
I'm leaving for my vacation soon.  I have everything all packed and ready to go.
Going to see family.  I just don't want to leave anything behind that I might need on the trip.
I was very sad when my grandmother passed away.
It does get better_comma_ but it was just so sudden.
I am finally going on my dream vacation to Tahiti! I can hardly wait!
It just seems so exotic and far away.  I feel like I will love it there!

It is going well. I have never had so much faith in a doctor_comma_ his words really put me at ease.
Last weekend I was dragged to a live piano performance at a local concert hall.  I came away thinking it might have been one of the best live shows I have ever seen!
I did_comma_ but I was so enthralled by the entire thing.  The pianist was amazing!
I would surely go to more concerts if they were like that!
I never finished school. I had problems with my mental health and just stopped showing up to class. It was very hard for me.
Well this was four years ago. I am barely starting to feel better now_comma_ I am in the beginning steps of going to vocational school
I recently invested pretty heavily into cryptocurrency. I'm anxiously awaiting to see if it pays off!
Thanks for the kind words. Yeah_comma_ it is a bit risky. I did invest heavily_comma_ but not so much so that it burdens my finances.
Oh man_comma_ if only I knew about it before the HUGE boom it had! I always feel regret when reading this bitcoin millionaire stories.
I just found out that my supervisor approved a pay increase for me starting next week! It was completely unexpected and I am elated!
That's what I am saying!  It was a great windfall!
My niece got her license last week!
She's not!  I can't believe it_comma_ I'm so happy with how grown up she is now.
I am so happy for my daughter. 
She got accepted at Harvard. I am so proud of her her.
I tried to make a new dish last night for dinner_comma_ but when it tasted to gross I had to throw it out.
Yea I will still try new dishes. I just can't get the terrible taste out of my mouth!
I was really happy and appreciative 
Yes a friend too
I am going on a road trip so later today I have to buy stuff for sandwiches_comma_ waters_comma_ snacks_comma_ I have even made a list. I think I am really ready for this.

The other day I was at work and my friend wouldn't help do any of the work! the entire day she just sat there and talked_comma_ I was so mad at her. I practically did all the work that day
I did_comma_ and she said that she was going to change. i just hope that she wasn't just saying something to get rid of me
I invited my mom out to dinner the other night_comma_ because we haven't seen other in a while. I was all willing to pay_comma_ since I invited her_comma_ but she stole the check and paid for it instead. 
It was! I thanked her and said that I could get it next time we went out. 
We went to "Cowboy Mexican" place near us called La Hacinda Ranch. They have really good veggie fajitas and the atmosphere is really nice.
Last weekend_comma_ I won $2500 playing roulette at the casino!
Thanks! I still don't know what to spend the money on.
I recently flew for the first time on an airplane!
My anxiety was through the roof_comma_ it was terrible!
i felt bad after my partner discovered that i was cheating him
i came to discover later after heartbreaking him
why
I just can't wait for this weekend
My family and I are going camping in the mountains.
That is so awesome! Did it take a while for your baby to learn that?
It's the baby that you described above. It's your baby_comma_ right?
I was on the phone with my bank about some overdraft charges that were charged because of their error. I am still angry about it.
It was about $350 in fees.  I was able to get them all reversed but it took about a month.  So irritating!
I witnessed a man rob an old woman walking across the street. Boils my friggin' blood!
I would have chased that punk down if I was close enough_comma_ but I saw it from a distance. 
They did_comma_ and I explained in as much detail as I could remember what he looked like. Hopefully they catch him.
I felt so bad for her. She seemed really shook up.
My sister is so lucky adn sso good at design_comma_ she has the prettiest nursery set up for her daughter!  My kids were lucky to have a matching crib bed set lol
Yes_comma_ she's just so naturally good at it.  I'm not crafty but she is. Always has been.  Her daughter is going to have a gorgeous room as long as she's under her roof
Yeah me too.  When I was growing up_comma_ my room was just covered in posters and hippie stuff. Not much artistic expression.  My house now isn't much better. Just a few pics of the kids.  boring
Next week Madden 19 comes out_comma_ I look forward to it every year!
I agree_comma_ it also means football season is around the corner which is my happiest time of the year.  What about you?
Yes thankfully that means summer is going to someday end.  It has been brutally hot where I am.
Yes whoever invented air conditioning deserves a Nobel peace prize_comma_ he or she has probably prevented a million fights and a million deaths lol.
I was looking through my attic this weekend for stuff to donate to the local shelter and I came across a box with all of my old baseball gear.  It really brought back memories
Oh I don't mean cards_comma_ I mean gear like old jerseys_comma_ batting gloves_comma_ and stuff I used when I played
Yes it can.  I think I will donate some of the stuff.  But I am keeping my old jerseys and ball glove.  Too many good times come to mind to get rid of it
Sometimes I want to travel back in time to those simple days
I miss my college days_comma_ it was pure fun.
Just the parties and the amount of sex I had
I am irritated at people who smoke near me at work. It turns one into a second hand smoker
oh no_comma_ I can't be doing that everyday_comma_ I will just have to join the board so that I can influence a policy against them
My best friend at work recently left the job to start her nursing career.
She's doing well. I was so emotional with her leaving. I feel a lot of sentiment about it.
The other night_comma_ the sky got really dark and it started raining really heavy and hailing. 
It was! I wasn't expecting a storm. The power went out. 
Right before going into work_comma_ I spilled my drink all over my pants. Looks like I peed!
I didn't have a new pair on me_comma_ so I had to work the first few hours and do my best to hide it!
Oh wow_comma_ I didn't even know those existed! I need them due to how clumsy I am!
Growing up poor helped me appreciate the simpler things in life.  I was enthusiastic and content with the littlest things_comma_ like trips to McDonald's after Sunday Mass followed by walks on the beach and window shopping at the mall.  Some people may cherish an affluent childhood but I feel like I'm at an advantage fiscally_comma_ psychologically_comma_ and spiritually because I can never take any small thing for granted
That's cool.  Would you say these days you're living a minimalistic or lavish lifestyle
I just started my own business_comma_ here's to hoping it goes well!
It's always a huge risk_comma_ but it's something I've been wanting to do for a long time. What's life without risk?
Hey there bud_comma_ how's it goig?
Damages? That sucks. What happened?
Dang. Tough to trust people these days. Makes me thankful for my best friend that I've always been able to trust.
I always make a list before i buy groceries_comma_ never forget anything that way.
Well I mean I write it down on a list_comma_ that way I never forget anything haha.
I miss my grandparents so much it hurts.
yes_comma_ they live in a farm just outside were I live.We used to go there 2 times a month on weekends.
Someone made a huge mess in the microwave in the break room and didn't clean it up.
I want whoever made the mess to clean it up.  
I feel like if there's one thing equal to if not greater than sex it's seeing all my bills paid_comma_ debt nonexistent_comma_ income far greater than expenses and a nice fat check from tax returns at the end of the year.
Exactly.  Good lovin don't pay the bills
Hurricane season is right around the corner. Time to get prepared.
Make sure we have an escape route planned in case we have to evacuate. Make sure we have loads of bottled water_comma_ canned foods and things like that.
i promised my wife that i will stop drinking but it seems hard to stop_comma_ i feel so bad
thanks alot
My husband's socks and underwear are all over the house!
I'm not sure what you mean by "wisely." I could tell him_comma_ "Hey_comma_ I don't want to pick up after you_comma_" but I'm not sure that would go over well.
I have to give a speech at work tomorrow and I'm so nervous!
Oh yeah_comma_ I always start early!
When I was younger_comma_ I used to always watch my dad's softball games. Recently_comma_ he played in a game with his old buddies. It brought back so many memories of the old days.
They are some of the best memories. I'll cherish them forever.
My brother got into his first choice college! It was quite surprising
He was! I couldn't be more happy or him. He's always wanted to go there and most of his friends are as well
I just got a job interview!
It's a nanny position watching two twin babies.
I'm considering leaving my wife for my nanny because she seems more interested in my than my wife
My wife is carried away with her career_comma_ she does not even care about my meals or my health_comma_ we only see on sundays
I thank God everyday for the wife I have
Yes_comma_ but she actually takes even better care of me and that is why i am so grateful 
I've been with my wife for over 10 years and have always been dedicated to her. I can't understand why some people cheat.
Yeah. I've always said that if you're tempted to cheat_comma_ why not just end the relationship first?
I heard my favorite childhood song the other day!
It was an N Sync song. It was like a blast from the past_comma_ made me feel strange!
I spent many years taking care of my grandmother. Those are great memories!
No_comma_ she recently passed away. But she got to live a long and spoiled life. She passed at 75.
I am so sad these days because the way president Trumps acts.
And he can't stop lying all the time.
I'm about to move out of state all by myself. It makes me so nervous
I hope so. Being independent comes with a lot of anxiety as well
Hi there. Did you do anything fun for the 4th of July? I went kayaking and hit some pretty heavy rapids. I had trouble with them_comma_ but the friend I was with did not.
As often as I can. I don't get to enough. It's hard to get away from work. 
I just bought one this Christmas. It was a good investment.
I've never been ocean or sea kayaking before. I bet that would be very fun_comma_ especially if fishing were involved.
I just replaced my headlights in my truck and one of them went out inside of a week.
It's not but its a pain in the neck and $35 
That's the nice part about a truck. Plenty of room. Terrible gas mileage.
I went to the gym this morning with my friend and watched him jump rope for an hour straight without stopping
Yeah_comma_ I know...I couldn't stand doing it if I could do it.
I am so happy for my son.
He was just accepted at MIT.hE WORKED HARD FOR THAT.
My husband actually did the laundry last night.
I agree! He never does it unless I ask him to! It was a good surprise.
I am very anxious about the country these days
Because of the tarif war president Trump declare to the world.
I won $20 in a shooting competition with my friends_comma_ and a lot of bragging rights.
It was pretty great. I made them look like amatures
and I get a lot of bragging rights.
Hi friend_comma_ did you ever have an experience like mine? One where you have stepped into the dog poo?
Yea_comma_ did you ever do it in the barefooting. This is how I did it recently.
That is very true_comma_ but I have seen a couple ladies that like that sort of thing.
I have been really down lately. I recently lost a close family member. 
No_comma_ it isn't that bad. It's just grief of losing my grandmother. She was 93 and lived a very full and exciting life. It's just hard to know she is no longer here. 
We did. She always had her own garden and taught me all kinds of skills related to farming_comma_ preparing_comma_ and canning food. She was an awesome person. 
Thanks. I agree. I will miss her_comma_ but I will always have her spirit with me. 
i had some weak feeling on my interview day
no i had to take it the way it was
When I got married I had to board my dog at the vet_comma_ I felt so awful about it!
Yes_comma_ I was afraid he would miss me. I just felt so bad being away from him.
My dog I've had since I was a kid died a few days ago. It makes me very sad
It's sad_comma_ but you kind of expect it sometimes and luckily it wasn't sudden so that helped me to prepare
because in my family is very innocent about all (ex:to handle the regular work and school) still i am to rained in my family and me also learn about that
be sure to train about to the next generation to way of good things
yes this is a most important and must things also
I feel abandon these days.
My wife left me a month ago.My friends are trying to help me_comma_but it's not working
I can't believe the state of our politics in America.
Absolutely. Things have gotten so crazy that's it's almost pointless to engage others in objective discussion.
I just found out I am pregnant!
Yes! I could not be more ecstatic! I am so looking forward to being a mom!
I had to go to the doctor recently to get my foot looked at_comma_ always makes me scared going there.
Oh that's unfortunate_comma_ mine was for a possible infection.
When I went back to work I felt very uneasy about taking my infant to daycare. I was so upset and worried.
I'm glad you understand. I would panic at work_comma_ I couldn't relax! I ended up deciding to stay home with him full time after just three weeks back at work.
I have been feeling very apprehensive these days.
The racial tensions that are growing in the country thanks to Trump.
I am kind of mad at one of my co-workers
It is just one..He got the promotion I was after.
I was giving a presentation at work in front of upper management the other day. I forgot what I was talking about_comma_ started sweating and turned bright red! It was horrible!
Yeah_comma_ it was humiliating.  They were just sitting the staring at me.  The silence was brutal!
When my friend comes over he never keeps an eye on his kids and they ravage my home!
I don't know how to bring it up. I always hope he'd catch subtle hints like when I ask his kids to please not climb on my stuff!
I forgot to pack my suit so I had to borrow my friend's extra one when attending a wedding_comma_ and man it fits so bad! I look terrible!
I was_comma_ but I still felt so self conscious it was hard to enjoy the night.
The store was all sold out of the new book I wanted. 
I know! I normally do_comma_ but I thought it would be okay. Next time I will though. 
Someone backed into my truck in the parking lot.
I'm quite angry.   Naturally_comma_ they didn't leave any contact information and left.
There's no cameras in the parking lot :(
Whats another $1k out of my pocket.
Hi friend_comma_ did you ever walk in the woods only to see a snake?
Yes_comma_ and it was a big one!
It just sit there and then when I seen it_comma_ I ran away!
Yea_comma_ did you know that some people will eat the snakes?
I felt bad the other day- I tried on a dress at the store and it looked awful_comma_ but I saw another girl trying it on as well and she looked great.
I didn't_comma_ but I did find some shirts I like luckily. 
I forgot to zip my pant after using the washroom and I walked into a meeting with top executives from my head office
Yes and the funny part was I didn't realize until the meeting was ended. 
I am feeling an intense fear these days.
I know the reason. I found a mole on my back and I am afraid it's cancer
I recently went to a safari where I was riding in a vehicle and one of the elephants got a bit rowdy and pushed up against the truck. I was freaking out!
I'm not going to lie_comma_ it kind of made the experience even better in hindsight!
I was so excited about moving to the new house with my wife two days ago.
The same town but the house is much nicer and everything inside is new.
My social anxiety kicked up the other day while paying for groceries and I failed at doing basic math in my hand due to my nerves. I ended up giving the wrong amount of money.
Yup_comma_ I did! And I'm usually very good at math. When my anxiety acts up_comma_ it's like my brain just goes blank.
Hi friend_comma_ did you ever win a drawing that you won a cash prize for?
Nice_comma_ did you win because you like to brush your teeth with their toothpaste?
Yes! I won 25 thousand dollars once!
I know right!
My friend was very supportive when I was in distress 
Thank you
I bought my nephew one of his favorite toys--LEGO! He will be so happy!
He's really getting into exploring new things and building blocks in general.
Yeah_comma_ it's cool to see him develop into his own personality.
I cheated on my diet today. 
True_comma_ but I haven't cheated on my diet in over a year. 
I guess you're right. Do you have a diet?
I got a thank you note from the VP of applications at my company.
Its nice to be recognized on occasion.
Thanks. Grats  to you too.
My preschool aged son got invited to a birthday party last week and I wanted to take him_comma_ but I was a bit nervous because he's been acting out lately and I didn't want him throwing a tantrum in public. 
I did_comma_ and he was well behaved luckily! He was definitely not one of the most unruly kids out of the bunch haha.
Oh no haha he is just like a typical three year old_comma_ they all go through these "threenager" ages where they like to challenge you a lot. 
I saw my 3DS next to me on my desk and thought about all of the Pokemon games I played as a kid.
The first game I ever played was Pokemon Crystal. It was actually the first video game I ever owned. I miss those days.
I've kept up with the series and the quality of life changes they make with each generation are so good. The games feel really good right_comma_ especially if you played the original.
I am so happy these days because I am about to get a promotion at work
Yes_comma_ you are right about that.I worked really hard the last months.
I have my personal training exam coming up soon and I think I'll ace it!
I am so ready! I'm excited to start training people.
My husband was out of town for work recently_comma_ and it made me bummed out. I had no one to talk to or spend time with. 
I mostly just have been baking and reading_comma_ relaxing and just having some me time_comma_ but I just miss him haha. 
I invested some of my money in the crypto market last year. The market looks terrible right now and I'm afraid I'll lose my money!
Holy moly_comma_ that's a pretty big loss! I guess all we can do is wait and see.
My dad didn't invite me to his wedding_comma_ talk about an all time low.
We haven't talked in awhile but I think that's because of his soon to be wife. I've never felt so alone without my family.
Hi friend_comma_ do you have any mailings awaiting you?
I am expecting a letter with my bonus check!
Me too_comma_ my last one was only 1.25
I got an invite to go camping this weekend
Yes_comma_ I haven't been camping in years.  It's about time I get to use some of my gear.
5
Yesterday I got a raise! I'm glad my work was noticed
I did! I feel extra motivated too which is probably good for them too lol.
I love my wife so much.She is the center of my life.
If you ever find your soulmate like I did_comma_ you are gonna be very happy.
My fiance found a snake in our yard the other day! It was terrifying!
No he killed it. Somehow_comma_ I totally went inside and did not watch. We had to because we have two dogs that play in the yard.
My first pregnancy did not go as planned at all - in fact_comma_ it will probably go down as the most scary time in my life.
Things were fine until 36 weeks.  Then all you know what happened.  I developed HELLP syndrome_comma_ my organs started shutting down_comma_ blood pressure was super high.  Had an emergency c-section and in the hospital for over a week after - came close to losing both of us.
So I am headed out of town this weekend.  Going to try my luck at the casino!  I cannot wait
I play blackjack.  But my favorite all time is Texas Hold Em
I can sometimes.  But my biggest strength is my patience
I came home and I quickly realized that my neighbors chopped down a tree in my front yard while I was away on vacation.
I haven't done anything yet because I don't exactly know how to confront him. Maybe chop one of his down? In any event_comma_ I am pretty darn upset about it.
I have a 2 week vacation coming up. I'm very excited for it!
Italy! It's my first international trip so it should be very fun
Finally got a day off of work today. I sat down and played my favorite video game with my girlfriend.
Playing games with friends is the best - especially with a nice_comma_ cold six pack. What games do you typically play?
I am not happy at how I am treated because of my orientation to life
I am a rainbow person if you know what I mean
Do you know how mortified I am? I was knocked over by a huge wave in the ocean and my top was ripped off!
It was_comma_ I didn't even realize at first. My son had to point it out to me.
I am so prepared for my test tomorrow.
It's is an English writing test I studied super hard for.
I am so mad at the republicans.
It is mostly Trump.I am mad because they will not stand up to Trump.
I am so much in love with my wife.
10 years.She just got a very big promotion at work.She is so intelligent and dinamic
So_comma_ I accidentally threw out my co-worker's lunch today at work.
Yeah_comma_ it was when I was gathering up my trash when I was wrapping up my lunch_comma_ so it was an honest mistake. I felt pretty awful about it.
I'm not a fan of birthdays_comma_ so I usually try to keep my birthday secret from people when I meet them.
That's pretty much how I feel.  But these are new people at the college I work at_comma_ and my friend Ron brought something in for me_comma_ and said_comma_ "that the college told him it was my birthday."
He got me a can of Rockstar and a Funko Pop of Dogmeat from Fallout 4.
I had a very proud moment today...I think it has finally dawned upon my dog that she has to go to the bathroom outside!
It was! I've been training her for months. I was very impressed with her_comma_ (doesn't happen too often!)
I have the worst headache and can't get any of my cleaning done. It's frustrating.
I did but it's not doing the trick. I don't want to be laying around the rest of the day but I don't think I have a choice.
So_comma_ my girlfriend and I are going to San Diego this weekend for a work trip!
Not yet! We might go to Vegas_comma_ which isn't too far away. But for now_comma_ it's just two weeks are R&R.
I was wearing a new dress for the holidays and it just made me feel good about myself_comma_ it looked nice and it put me in a good mood.
Yeah_comma_ for sure_comma_ it always helps to give you a little boost haha.
Haha thank you_comma_ and have fun if you do!
About two weeks ago my wife got sick with Tonsilitis.
She's a lot better now_comma_ at least can eat solid foods_comma_ before it was only yogurt and soups she could swallow. I was doing her injections twice a day.
I have to give a major speech tomorrow at work early in the morning.
Is that even a question? Of course I am! I've been prepping all day!
I got off work the other day and noticed one of my tires had been slashed in the parking lot.  Needless to say_comma_ not the best way to end the work day
They have not found anyone yet.  What really hacks me off is our security cameras did not get a good view of the person
I am so happy these days.
I just met the most wonderful woman. We went out and clicked for the first time.
I have a huge test tomorrow in Physics and I don't feel prepared for it.
You're right! But no matter how much studying I may do_comma_ I know it's going to be a tough one.
I accidentally overdrafted my bank account and now don't have enough money to pay the fee or my bills. I'm scared of what could happen
Are you sure? I guess I will need to make some phone calls.
So_comma_ yesterday morning_comma_ some ingrate stole my cappuccino at Starbucks.
Well_comma_ it was pretty busy_comma_ so I think he just thought it was his. Maybe we had the same name? Anywho_comma_ all I know is is that I was far grumpier than usual.
Way back in my elementary school days_comma_ I lost the spelling when I was only in the second grade.
Yeah_comma_ I do recall that it was a swell time. I was pretty peeved that I lost though. I studied so hard.
I stole a soda as a teenager and got caught in the parking lot by the security people. I felt so ashamed.
Haha no she called my parents and I was banned from the store. 
I felt so accomplished when I started my own business. It's still in the beginning phase but it's an awesome feeling.
It's an online service business with mine and my wife's original music therapy songs.
My son won the spelling bee yesterday. I felt so proud of him!
I remember the last word was cafeteria. Which is somewhat funny because it's the word I missed when I was in my first spelling bee.
Yesterday I was looking through my wallet and realized a bunch of money was missing. There was only one person who was near my wallet.
It was the guy I thought was my best friend. I was so devastated. I didn't care about the money_comma_ but the fact he would stead from me. :(
My son failed his final exam yesterday. I was so upset with him!
He certainly did not! Although_comma_ I do have faith in him that he will turn it around next semester_comma_ since I am grounding him for eternity.
I recently traveled by plane and I loved seeing the city I love at night_comma_ the view was beautiful.
It was the first time I traveled at night_comma_ I loved it.
I share your opinion_comma_ it's great to see how small we are at that distance.
A while back_comma_ my ex-wife and I were having marriage problems.  To make things worse_comma_ my work sent another woman and I away for training for a few months.
I wouldn't call it destiny at all.  The whole time I was away_comma_ my wife thought I might had used this as an opportunity to have an affair since that other woman and I were close_comma_ but we didn't.
I miss my college days so much
I miss the fun I had on the parties and events.
I told my son repeatedly to do the dishes_comma_ but instead he played video games all night and never got them done.
That's definitely my plan. He will learn there will be consequences for his failure to listen.
I am being in fear lately
I stared to cough blood 3 days ago and I fear it must be cancer.
My friends took me to a club for the first time a few nights ago
I did actually_comma_ but I admit it was very scary and nerve-racking
I was meeting my friend for drinks and she said she left her debit card at home.
I agreed to pay for her drinks and mine since we are good friends.
I had to take the trash out last night and the bag busted open on the way to the road
Oh_comma_ you don't even know. I was covered in filth that "Cradle of Filth" doesn't even know about. I was so disgusted that I thought I was going to die.
I had a huge conflict with my parents about moving to another country and I was simply enraged to have them trying to control my life.
It was an awesome experience and after I came back to the US I felt so fulfilled and my perspective on everything has changed. 
I can't stop spending money_comma_ no matter what I do_comma_ no matter how many budgets I put together. How can I be so careless?
I haven't_comma_ what is that?
I got called into the CEOs office a number of years ago
I was shocked because  they offered a promotion. It sounded like something was wrong
Most of my co-workers are incompetent and can't recognize basic patterns
Yeah
Unlikely_comma_ company's not doing well right now.  they can fire people but they won't get to back full.  So we're stuck with'em
I ate all of the pizza that I got my friends last night. I felt pretty rotten afterwards.
Oh_comma_ believe me_comma_ it was some sever indigestion. It sounded like Krakatoa was erupting again.
I didn't have a way to pay for my lunch despite today being pay day!
I asked my friend to pay and he_comma_ lucky for me_comma_ agreed to as long as I paid him back.
When I was driving home from work the other day I saw a lot of very dark clouds in the sky.
How did you guess? I was guessing that a thumerstorm would arrive with lots of rain. I was right when it started downpouring a few minutes later!
I am so mad at my boss these days.
We were working on an important project and he passed an idea I gave him as his own idea.
My son won his last baseball game and he is going to the state championship!
He plays first base! Best first baseman in the whole state of Alaska.
I was cleaning out my closet and noticed some old photos I took of my very first car.  Man_comma_ it makes me miss the days when life was simple
I had an old Ford Taurus.  It was not much_comma_ but to me it was the best car ever!
I ate ten Big Macs last night because I was so hungry and depressed. I resented myself afterwards.
I was so bothered because the 30 chalupas that I ate at Taco Bell for lunch were very unsatisfying. I had to haze myself further to get rid of the feeling of remorse. It didn't work out too well.
The other day I saw a man take a dog from the street_comma_ I've been seeing that dog for a while and in a couple of days I see this dog on the streets again_comma_ poor little thing. I thought it'd have a better life.
I don't know but it's a sweetheart_comma_ I'd take it myself if only I didn't have one already. 
My grandfather passed a year ago today thanks to medical malpractice. 
One step at a time basically_comma_ I hate he couldn't get a good doctor but that was "the best the VA could do"
No_comma_ they covered their butts really well with paperwork. It wasn't worth it sadly. 
I won first place at the egg swallowing contest at my school the other day!
It is! It is quite the competition here in Alaska. We don't have much to do_comma_ so we try to humor ourselves with the simpler things in life.
I was shopping at the store the other day and I bumped into a rack and spilled wine bottles everywhere. Everyone was staring. 
No luckily haha but it made me blush for sure.
I was almost hit by a car while I was walking in a crosswalk and I cursed the lady out. Then I saw a little kid in the car and instantly regretted what I just said.
I know.  It was not my proudest moment.
I am so happy with my life right now.
Nice advice _comma_ thanks.I will make sure I follow the advice.
I am expecting a big recession on the horizon 
We all do.When the recession comes_comma_ it will affect the economy as a whole.
I was hiking in the Outback of Australia the other day. I managed to swallow a dozen ostrich eggs on my adventure.
They do! I felt somewhat bad for all the little ostriches inside...but they tasted so delicious.
Sorry to cut that short_comma_ but I have to send an email to a company I really want to work for today and I don't want to mess it up. 
Yeah it would be for my first internship and it could really make my life much easier if I get it. 
No I haven't but I need to. I will once we finish this conversation. 
My husband's grandma came to visit_comma_ we did all sorts of fun activities at the beach and aquarium.
Just getting to see her with our kids_comma_ bonding. Oh and she is Thai and cooked some delicious food.
You know what's great? Finding pictures of my kids as babies and going through those and remembering all the great times.
Sometimes I do_comma_ sometimes I don't! But the few I find always mean so much to me!
It is uncomfortable for the internet service to fail when I am doing something important on the PC.
Exactly_comma_ it causes a little impotence not knowing how to solve it.
Thank God in most cases they solve it quickly.
Last week my daughter had a big soccer game against a team that was better than hers.
It was tied up until the final minute then my daughter scored the winning goal! I was screaming so loud I think she got embarassed_comma_ haha!
My husband's sister was living with us. She was acting rude so we had to kick her out.
No not at all it's a little tense.
She wanted to try to use all of the money she had saved up (only a few hundred after two months) to go visit a friend in California even though she was supposed to be saving up for her own place or school_comma_ and when we said no she started insulting us. 
Last week_comma_ I had to give a speech. I was very nervous so I practiced over and over. When the time came_comma_ I was ready and it went awesome
Yeah_comma_ I was really nervous. But everyone thought it was a great speech and we went to the bar for drinks after.
After spending so much on my brother's tuition fees overseas_comma_ he still ended up becoming a musician without popularity
I just take it that I did something for God_comma_ I hope he rewards me 
My kids are doing everything but listening today! I guess the boredom that comes with summer break is getting to them.
I tried_comma_ they don't even want to do that! So frustrating.
My dad knew that I have recently hit a rough patch with my finances and gave me 2 grand. I can't thank him enough.
It really is going to help a lot.  I feel so blessed!
My boss just gave me an all expense paid ticket to paris to enjoy my annual leave and im happy
Yes I am_comma_ I have been working for 3 years in a row without a holiday :) 
I woke up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night and saw a scorpion. I covered it with a bowl but when I woke up it was gone from the bowl.
I was too afraid of the poison haha.
When I was younger_comma_ I had social anxiety. Speeches would give me terrible anxiety
Slowly. Therapy and medication have helped a lot.
I was on the phone with my aunt. I am so awkward and bad at speaking so I was nervous.
She was but we had a few awkward pauses.
There was a traffic jam because people were slowing to look at a wreck on the other side of the highway
It added a lovely 20 minutes to my drive home
I know!
My daughter had a little chihuahua pup that we rescued and she had an autoimmune disease.  We had a rough first year_comma_ but then it seemed things were good.
Well_comma_ we made it 6 years and then she got pancreatitis.  She recovered from that but then we noticed her being really sleepy.  Turns out her body had started destroying her red blood cells_comma_ we tried for a few weeks to help her_comma_ but ultimately there was nothing more we could do.  I still think about her daily.
I get to fly up and go see my girlfriend in Boston soon!
About two months! However while it is sappy_comma_ more than a day without seeing her feels like eternity. 
I broke my ankle right before my wedding! This is a nightmare!
I tripped down my steps carrying the laundry. I wish I would've been more careful_comma_ this is the worst. I can't walk down the aisle!
I survived cancer and I'm thankful
Yes now I take things easy and appreciate every chance to do good
my boss asked me a question that I had an answer to but I did n ot want to get anyone in trouble so I said I didn't know anything about the situation.
maybe_comma_ but what drama did I avoid. Not getting a co-worker in possible trouble or not being honet with my boss?
I have never cheated on my boyfriend
Nope! It's important to have trust in a relationship.
I had to train a new employee at work today.
She wasn't the type of person that listened very well. In fact_comma_ she decided to go smoke a cigarette during our training session.
That was exactly what I thought.
I am so happy that I have finally gotten a head start on being organized to teach this year
Thank you. There is so much to do when you are teaching multiple grades
The quality of television the make these days compared to when I was growing up is very good
yes now you have LED and OLED
My husband and I were about to go away for our first vacation together. I was so excited.
We went to Lake Powell in Utah to rent a house boat.
I am so scary that my manager doesn't keep his promise for my promotion.
I don't know. I have a bad feeling about it.
My daughter's daycare teacher just called me and told me how she's been so sweet to the new boy in her class who was very nervous on his first day. I couldn't feel more joy.
It does but she also has a sweet and kind nature about her.
I get to go fishing on friday!
aboout a 8 out of 10
Yeah_comma_ I'm glad I live near the coast. Otherwise it would be tough to go.
I did not have enough money for rent_comma_ but I had some freelance work that I could do and I was confident I could make the money in time.
Thank you_comma_ that's encouraging. 
I stop taking people serious after i realize that my wife of 5 years had a baby without telling me
It's alright_comma_ I think it's good to do proper background check and make sure one is 100% sure before jumping into dealings with people these days 
I do not know if I will get a positive or negative review. I do not ever look forward to these things! 
It is my annual review for work. My performance review. 
Last week I felt so abandoned when my family went to town all day without me.
Yeah_comma_ I was pretty miserable until they got home_comma_ but then I felt much better.
The other day after hockey I found out my cat died_comma_ pretty miserable.
His name was Sylvestre_comma_ what was your cats name?
I had him for just 2 years_comma_ he was a baby :(
I've a bit nervous. I've got a blind date tomorrow.
Maybe a little of both.    I've had some bad blind date experiences
I'm about 75/25 with 75 being not that great or just like bad matches... like "what in the hell made x person think we'd be a match" type stuff
it's the anniversary of my grandmother's death today
yeah it sucks_comma_ I was with her for all through her cancer and last days.
For my 16th birthday I received a brand new car! It was a red convertible.
I crashed it but it was a good little car.
I wish I had taken better care of the car. I had some great memories with it.
It's going to be a very challenging school year for my daughters.
They're musicians and the school band is switching a lot of things around.
hi there?
did you see my post above about allergy?
I had severe allergy in couples of month. I tried a new diet and it was helpful in relieving my allergy. I felt happy.
I felt life is better afterward
Feeling happy in my work and being able to enjoy it makes my life better.
I think I should strive to feel good things by doing what takes more time in the day.
I try to meet daily goals as a challenge and that makes me happy.
I was bummed out this mothers day because my mom disowned me and won't speak to me.
Well she was upset at me for running away and having a baby as a teen.
I had to get ready for a job interview last week and I did a lot of homework!
Yes_comma_ I did a lot of research about the company online. I felt like I really did well with every question they asked me!
Thanks_comma_ I do too! It made a difference to really focus on getting ready beforehand.
when I was a teenager my mother always tried to get me to be ready for being sexually active_comma_ and I knew what to do and where to go to get birth control.
I did a little bit but my mom is pretty cool. I can appreciate it now_comma_ I felt ready for anything_comma_ you know?
I have been posted to the middle east for work_comma_ i'm a little bit edgy about what the place will be like
Yes kind of because I will be away from my family for 6 month in a place where they have different belief system about everything
Can't believe I finally finished high school_comma_ didn't think I'd make it.
It took a lot of effort_comma_ I put a lot of credit on my science teacher for pushing me through.
I went into the living room there was a big party waiting for me for my birthday. I was beyond elated.
I know I'm beyond blessed!
I had a grand time and there was ice cream cake.
My husband's grandma came to stay with us when we had our third baby and she took great care of us_comma_ made us a lot of food and bought us some new kitchen tools.
Yeah it made us so comfortable_comma_ and it was so helpful.
I had a bad experience where my jacket was stolen.  
My favorite outdoor one
I don't think I will
I was playing in the kitchen and accidentally broke my moms vase.
I know I feel so badly about it.
I just booked a place for a week at the beach later this month. I can't wait!
Thanks! We haven't been to the beach for a few years_comma_ and my son is about to be a senior so we don't have many family vacations left. 
It's true_comma_ the beach is always relaxing and good family time. 
I have had so many health issues this year. It is been crucial to find the silver linings
On the one hand_comma_ I could see how you would feel that way_comma_ but on the other hand it was a really responsible thing you did.  Do you get out often to the batting cage with your kids?
I am a very optimistic person. Everyday I wake up expecting the best!
Honestly_comma_ when I get out of work lol but waking up is pretty nice too. How about you?
LOL that's a good choice. Alcohol is the solution as they say
My wife has been paying more attention on our son since childbirth. It's not fair_comma_ I feel left out 
oh well_comma_ i feel like she has a new boyfriend_comma_ is that normal?
I was caught taking something that was not mine I feel so bad about this
I took my dad's rolex
I feel bad because he died the next day and I just realized that he left it for me as an inheritance 
I took my little boy to the zoo last month. It was fun_comma_ but he soaked his diaper three times!
Luckily_comma_ I brought a full package of diapers with me. So we both got to have fun!
I received a full ride scholarship to my dream school. I was so happy.
I cried_comma_ jumped_comma_ and screamed all at the same time.
Thank you hard work definitely pays off.
I have read alot so I know I won't fail the exam I am going for
Chemistry
I had forgotten to start dinner_comma_ even though my husband has asked me to while he was at work_comma_ and so when he got home we had no food_comma_ and I felt bad.
Yes but he asked me to start the food so he could finish cooking it_comma_ but I forgot even though I said I would.
Today I helped a friend of mie who is going through a rough time. Her husband has left her and he drained the bank account.
I think she will_comma_ we got coffee and I'm treating her to a spa day.
I was at the store_comma_ and I saw someone cut in front of someone else in line which made me really upset.
Yeah it made me kind of ticked off frankly_comma_ but I didn't say anything.
I found some old toys from when I was a kid
I did get one working again actually. 
its an old planetarium thing that you put in a dark room and it projects stars on the wall (constillations and such)
I get to fly up and see my girlfriend in a few weeks! 
Just about two months. However as sappy as it sounds_comma_ more than a day without seeing her feels like forever. 
I went skydiving a couple months ago and seriously had to trust that the guy going with me knew what he was doing.
Thanks! I don't know how brave I am but I trusted the tandem diver.
I had a big presentation that I was very nervous about_comma_ but I practiced ahead of time and nailed it!
It was in front of a lot of important higher-ups so I didn't want to make myself look bad. Luckily they turned out to be really nice individuals!
One morning my cat was screaming and I found out she pooped on the bed
I had to pick her up and wash her and then clean up the mess. It was really annoying.
So this weekend I went to the hall bathroom and I snake was there!  I nearly passed out
No.  It was a little garden snake.  But not something I was expecting to see at midnight on my bathroom floor.  
I felt I was ready for the task after all the research I had done on the individuals I would be meeting with.
The task was the job interview.
The job interview went very well as I received an offer for the position shortly after the experience.
Thank you_comma_ was there a situation where you felted very ready for?
I got an extra day off this week that I wasn't expecting!
I really am. I love days off_comma_ but I suppose everyone does too lol
My ex husband passed away last year.
Yes_comma_ but I really did take it hard. We knew each other for 30 years.
My boss talked down to me the other day_comma_ it made me so upset! 
So true so true you cant... unless you quit lol 
I know so tempting tho when they treat you so badly to just drop the mic ( walk out! :p ) 
So_comma_ just a few weeks back we had our summer vacation_comma_ which consisted of 14 hours of driving with 4 boys aged 9-15. Needless to say_comma_ I'm glad that drive is over. 
Yeah_comma_ add another one in and double the time and you'll have our trip. The youngest has ADHD too_comma_ so that always keeps it interesting. 
Yeah_comma_ I still wake up with cold sweats after nightmares about hearing_comma_ "Are we there yet"_comma_ over and over again. 
My friend likes to learn new things sometimes_comma_ and he recently learne to juggle several items at once!
Same here. I have no idea how he does it...but it's quite amazing to see. I'm somewhat envious
My partner is away getting treatment and therapy and it's hard.
Oh he just has a lot of trauma from childhood and he takes a lot out on me so he has to get help in order for anything to continue between us.
Thank you! You are so sweet! I hope so too. 
There was no traffic on the way to work today!
It did 
It's not here. I'm not sure why traffic was so low.  Maybe there was a wreck up the road in the other direction.
Well_comma_ my daughters have a day off from school due to our state elections.
Yeah_comma_ it's nice for them. I like it when they're home.
I am super happy to be getting a new perfume today and a mostly full bottle. 
It's more of a manly smell. It's Jimmy choo or tresor not sure which. but you know when you are poor it is hard to afford much_comma_ so I am happy I can afford a nice perfume for once
I am staying very positive that this year even if it is coming close to an end I will find a better job! 
Yes it will and thank you for the encouragement! :) 
I was very happy when we got to see a concert involving my brother. I was nice seeing him up there
It was a local show with a band he was in at the time
Well I recently rescued another abused dog and I feel so protective towards her. She is so docile and she was so starved. I just want to keep her safe.
Thanks! She is finally not so hungry after a week of eating a few times a day! Poor thing
This past year_comma_ i failed my Calculus class twice. I am lost and don't know how to pass this class
I asked indeed. She just tells me to study hard and that is it. What should i do
My credit card is ridiculous. I'm so embarrassed and upset with myself that I let it get this bad.
I was_comma_ I haven't used my card in awhile but the big number is still there.
I was happy when my dad got to retire. He worked hard for it
He was in his mid 60s
I really think I am going to get the preapproval from the bank for my new home purchase... 
Like you would not believe! I am so happy for it_comma_ and feeling positive. 
I am starting off at a new school next month.
No. It's highschool. I don't know anyone. I am pretty nervous.
I went off of my keto for a two days and I feel a bit bad about it- I ate a bag of cheetos over two days. They were organic anyhow
For sure! Well today I am starting and back on fasting. I feel so good when I do the two meals and fasting but you know- sometimes all of  sudden you just want a bad food!
I'll be going swimming this weekend.
It's a pool in a nearby state park.
Someone stole my lawn mower
I felt really bad
No I don't have for the mower
My daughter is leaving me.
She is starting school. Im going to be all alone.
She is too young to leave the state_comma_ but she is an adult.
Well I had to go to the store yesterday but I was all muddy. It made me quite anxious. I didn't have a choice as my power went out and I didn't have much clean.
I usually do not but boy I hate it when my clothes are not clean and I'm not clean. I try not to let it get to me..but I just feel gross! lol
Crazy eyes won't work here as I am in the ghetto- most everyone is really crazy lol
 I spilled water all over myself at school and it looked like a peed on myself! ugh 
luckily no because im in florida but ugh i felt so dumb! 
I know and hear I told you not to worry about what people think but here I am worrying! ohhh the struggle 
My toddler is learning how to talk and what objects are called. The other day he was at my parents house and came out of his room with a stuffed giraffe and told everyone_comma_ "look_comma_ giraffe!"
He is 2 and a half. He was born a month early too_comma_ so when he hits milestones its always really cool for us.
Well my partner fell off the wagon lately and went back to people that are really bad for him. He has bipolar etc so his influences are really crutial.
Oh I have unfortunately. He is in therapy now because I won't put up with those people in my life and he has to learn for himself how bad of an influence they are. Celebrating his bad behavior does not make a good friend. Thats an enemy truly.
It killed me pretty much when I lost my dad. It was so random and I was not ready for it
He had a brain issue that got him instantly
I drank yesterday on my lunch break and was nervous to come back into the office afterwards.
I was a little buzzed but it was definitely worth it as I got to try a few new-to-me sour beers
What is your favorite? Mine is Prairie Vape Tricks!
This year I decided to donate school supplies to my daughters school.
I hope so. I don't like for anyone to feel left out.
I might do it every year now.
I was a little unsure when I changed schools. I was not sure how it would go.
It went well but I did not know that going in
Have you ever really watched one of those st jude infomercials?
I watched on last night. It mafe me so sad.
Really? That seems like a lot.
I was shocked in a good way when my dad got me a truck. It was for my senior year in high school
Yeah I was really happy
My pet snake died :(
I had him for 15 years.
Indeed it is. It's been many years.     Do you have any pets?
I felt bad when I missed my cousins wedding. I even made up a bad excuse
I said I was sick_comma_ but I was actually hungover
My partner is away at therapy and he sent me a card. I was really shocked as he normally needs a prompt to do anything that involves a gift.
Yes. I hope so! It's one little step but it's a big one for him to do on his own.
Always work on yourself. Learn and grow for the better.
Do you have a partner?
No_comma_ not anymore.
Bad at first_comma_ but good to find someone better_comma_ it's hard to find someone though.
Well I am having a fly issue. I have sticky fly paper (although I hate killing anything) and I clean and no matter what I keep getting flies that bat themselves at me all day.
I have clove oil and I have tried basil. It seems like the little tiny fly babies get in so I can barely have my window open. My lawn is mowed but it drives me crazy and it takes all day to kill them. Then it restarts the next day! Any flowers that keep them away?
No way to get rid of flies with that- I have pets so I don't want any poison for them or the earth. There are lots of abandoned houses around here- I am sure that contributes.
I have always bought my kids clothes from the same store_comma_ Childrens Place.
They clothes are cute and afordable and they dont shrink. Plus they give me coupons.
I have been a loyal customer for 12 years and 3 kids. I love them.
I knew I was going to ace my science test. I spent a lot of time studying for it
It was my senior year of high school
Well my power went out yesterday before my shower and before I had washed my clothes. So I had to run up to the fast food place- walk- and try to contact my mom. It made me a bit embarassed going outside in dirty clothes with wet hair.
Oh they did_comma_lol. I noticed in the least. I was covered in mud by the end of it too as the water people nicked the electric and they have mud everywhere from digging. I have a lot of anxiety so I don't like going out much anyway.
I knew I was going to get this job. I just wanted it more than other people
I did get it
Do you have any children?
I was thinking about when I had my first one hand how scared I was.
It was. The crazy thing is I was just as scared with my next two. Anything acan happen.
I was so scared when I started my most current job that I had to trick myself into being less shy. 
Me too! I sat in the parking lot for an hour reading a self help book just to be able to 'fake it' by seeming outgoing.
Surprisingly_comma_ yes! It had quick little stories of people overcoming difficult social situations. It must have been good for me because I am still there 10 years later. haha
I got to meet my kids teacher yesterday.
Yep. I was surprised because she is so young but she seemed really accomplished.
Thats exactly how I feel. Some teachers seems like they just want the check and wee all know teachers don't get paid much.
That is so true. I think she is gonna do great though.
I get to go to the thrift store this weekend and I haven't been in a long time! It's one of my favorite places to shop
I am going to get some shirts. I'd love to buy even more but I really need shirts. I can find super nice brands for so cheap and new. It's better than buying the cheap new stuff on other websites that is bad quality. I love finding the deals! I am spoiled by 90% or more off.
I'm kind of socially awkward and I don't know how to start conversations in real life. I wish i had more friends
thank you for your support! I have a really good friend but he lives in a different state so we don't see each other that often
My new neighbor is so weird. He scares me.
He is always just staring out of his window and walkin the neighbor hood late at night. He always keeps al of his lights on too.
I don't he acts a killer from a suspense move. I say hi and he just stares.
No. He's like 25. I want to move.
Yeah I found out the raise goes into effect immediately and I got a new desk and office also
It was awesome_comma_ I feel like I deserved it after trying and getting rejected so many times. I'm ready to move up
MY daughter this money grows on trees and life is so easy.
I cant wait until she is older. She will change her tune.
She is 13. She needs to get it together.
I like to look back at times of my childhood.
They mostly are_comma_ at least the one's I chose to bring up.\
I got arrested when I was younger. I felt embarrassed to tell my parents
I got a dwi
So I saw a guy at the gas station yesterday and he was over 40..listening to nasty rap and of course he got out to use the free air pump then just THREW it on the ground. They constantly have to replace it and it's the only free one in the area.
I know right? It is so ghetto in my neighborhood but I just cannot stand people who behave that way. Yes zero respect and zero care for even their own things_comma_ let alone others. Its sad.
Today I woke up to the sound of rain outside my window. It was so much better than my terrible alarm clock waking me up. 
Indeed! It makes me so happy. Some people hate the rain_comma_ I am not one of those. Glad you like it too. Makes the world feel cleaner too.
It does. Makes me feel like the day is going to be A-Ok! 
I knew my dad was going to heal. He was in the hospital but I had a good feeling
He had a weird stomach rash
Well when I was at the gas station yesterday I kept hearing a child scream- I saw a lady park right in front and take a little boy in- I thought it was him- But she had left her little GIRL in the car ALONE!
it was hot out too! I couldn't believe it- She had also whipped in_comma_ in front of cars with two kids. Seriously why do some people have kids?
I once haf my name called over the intercom at Walmart.
I hsd left my purse in the mens bathroom. The womens was to crowded and I had to go.
But it was so embarassing.
I've always tried to be good to my family.
No_comma_ I just do this because I see so many others not treating their families right.
I just started the show Luther on Netflix.
It is. I sisnt know that English shows were that good_comma_
Im going to watch more.
Yesterday someone pulled up beside us in the gas station_comma_ blasting rap music. I was shocked when a middle aged white guy stepped out. It was super obnoxious_comma_ vile music too.
It's very common here. You have gramma's doing bad things_comma_ walking down the street drunk or drugged etc. But it still shocks me when someone who is a father and grandpa is acting like a bad teen
It was very random when it happen_comma_ but my grand ma passed away and it was sad. I did not expect it
Yeah I have experience a lot of that recently
I am sticking by my partner even though he has done a lot because no one else has. While he is in therapy. It's hard. I don't know if he will get better but I guess it's worth a shot since no one else has ever helped him or been a good influence.
Thank you! He has had many from me. But this is the last one. He has had to go away. He might have FAS and he has bipolar so it makes me feel more compassion about his outbursts
Bipolar is hard_comma_ especially if their meds stop working or they don't get extra therapy and work on themselves
I was shamed when my dad got in trouble. It was just a little sad to be his son at the time
He got a dwi in his 50's
There was a big storm last night.
I was so scared. There was so much lightning.
I am. I would have really been scared if the power went out though.
My kids are 3 and 5 and school starts soon and I can't wait!
No_comma_ my 5 year old was in prek last year and my 3 year old went to mother's day out last year two days a wekk.
Yes it is! They get so bored during the summer. There's only so much I can do to entertain them.
I was cleaning out my house the other day and came across my parents old wedding rings. 
I put them together on a necklace so I can wear them. :) 
Both of my daughters are fine musicians.
10-Piano_comma_ 13-Violin.
yes_comma_ I'm a guitar player
I am happy about my first meal in a few hours. I am back on keto so I fast and then have two meals. It makes that first meal something I look forward too a lot!
Well I have a place I love where I get a salad and a piece of cheesecake and I eat that for both my meals. When I do that_comma_ I lose weight and feel so much better. Bonus is again- I look sooo forward to it and it tastes even better!
my son pooped his pants but lucky i carry baby wipes to wipe it up quick before it leaks
i just carry extra diapers but maybe i should start carrying exgtra clothing
My mom has helped my gramma for years. With her husband before he died..and now she helps her. My gramma is very giving but can be kind of mean to my mom at times. I am very proud of her for still being so kind
She is over 80. Oh she is lovely to us all for her whole life. Nicest most giving person. But I think she is getting a touch of something so she can get cranky a bit with my mom at times. Well we ALL can be grumpy at times lol
My car broke down
I'm not sure_comma_ It wouldn't start the morning.   Its not the batttery or starter.
Well I don't know what's broken_comma_ so that's a bit of a problem
I was mad when my cousin did not come to my moms funeral. He lied to me about it
He was sick. He went to a party instead
When I was young I loved the PBS channel.
I liked the kids learning shows. When I got older I applied to work at out local station.
I got to temp as a reception for a few months. I met a lot of people from TV
I was at the dealership where I bought my car a week ago and I was getting an oil change. The service was so good_comma_ and they took care of my car really quick!
No_comma_ compared to what I would pay for another place to do it it was cheap. Plus they always have a cool waiting room with snacks
My daughter starts daycare soon_comma_ first time_comma_ first born but I think I have everything ready! 
Yes a little bit because its hard to trust anyone and I am so protective over her. I will miss her a lot! 
I know they have cameras yes_comma_ but I didnt know there was a way us as parents could watch them like a smartphone feature or? 
 (Sorry yes daycares do have a way to log in- ask them so you can ensure she is safe) I am losing weight again and it's been hard with my stress_comma_ age and after surgery. I love feeling the new areas I am thin!
I do keto! I can't do so much cheese or meat if its not organic. But I found out about natural sugar substitues like Xylitol (wow!!) as I have a sweet tooth- But fasting and only eating two meals has done WONDERS for me! 
Oh you should try keto with it- as it keeps you FULL and you don't get hungry so it's possible! Try doing 16 hours- Not eating breakfast until 4 hours or so after getting up. It regenerates your organs_comma_ skin everything and SO much energy!
my neighbor has an ugly cat that keeps pissing in my bbq grill
its a big old cat its not a kitty. I kept telling the owners but they dont care
Strangely I have a cat tail too! I rescue and my cat room needs to be painted badly but I have been so busy working and also on a side business that I have had no extra time!
I work on the weekend too! LOL! I am trying to start a business but yes! I HAVE to do it this weekend as everything should be clean for them. I will do it! No matter what.
My neighborhood put together a community wide cleanup day_comma_ it was great fun and such a sight to see!
I think so_comma_ it was such a great turnout_comma_ it'd be silly not to!
The other day some guy was pounding so hard on my door for almost 5 minutes. I didnt even want to answer it was so sketchy! 
Exactly_comma_ I would never pound on someones door. It was during the day_comma_ and I had a peephole and seen neighbors outside so I finally decided to answer it to see what he wanted but it had me scared. 
We just bought a car for cheap as ours was in an accident and the guy seemed so normal but lied and the engine has a ton of issues. 
There is no warranty with private used cars. My hubby is a mechanic and saw no issues and drove it..However he then saw oil leaking when we got home and they had used the neon stuff all over the engine previously he saw under the black light..So they KNEW the engine was bad. So awful! We don't have a car now
Isn't it awful? People are horrible. We might just deal with a car payment every month now. As it's hard to buy from private sellers! So many are lying.
there was a time i had no food to eat now i'm so glad i can afford food and my pantry is stocked to the brim
not that far but i had to go to a pantry to get food _comma_ it was generic foods
My neighborgood wasn't so safe last year.
Who is he?
Now I see the mistake I made too lol. There just were abunch of bad people around. This summer was nice for the kids though. They are all gone.
I love to see the kids have fun! We all deserve a fevent childhood.
Im feeling a little bad about what I did maybe I shouldnt maybe I should idk. 
My wife and I both needed new phones_comma_ but I could only afford 1 and I ended up buying 1 for myself. I am going to buy her one in a few months but I still feel real bad about it. 
Yeah but I can feel the tension! 
so happy i could afford a 65 inch tv_comma_ i had a small 19 incher for years. it was not pleasant but i was poor and struggling
what size do you have ?
I had my power go out yesterday and it reminded me of how grateful I am to have that convenience!
Only about 4 or 5 hours but boy- I didn't have clean clothes or had a shower- I couldn't cook. It reminded me of when I was poorer also. Glad I have it!
I was working and a lady was concerned about her daughter. I went above and beyond my work description in order to let her know about cameras at a daycare and how she could see them. 
Yes! She was so kind and I am glad I could help her to make sure he baby is safe!
yes! It should be mandatory honestly
My aunt died last week
Yeah its pretty bad. She had cancer and they didn't see it late.  Atleast it was pretty fast
She went to the hospital and the whole thing start to finish was under a month.  They did a week of chemo and it didn't work.
My brother lives across the country and told me he wouldn't make it out for my graduation but he did anyway!
It was_comma_ I didn't think it'd happen but it did!
I got detention when I did not wrong. I was so furious at the kid who actually did the deed
That I cheated
Does it make you happy to see others you havent seen in a while

Thank you 
Yes . everyday . I just was traveling and staying with my sister in Italy . 
I bought a storm kit  because we werent prepared last time
Just a bad lightening storm that left us without power for days. 
Well I have one now.
I know better now. My kids we so afraid at night. Candles don't do very much.
I just got a new phone. It was the one I wanted and for a great deal! I don't like spending money but I figured the better one would last longer. 
Well it's helpful in my rough neighborhood to have a good working phone and video. Also I use it for work. I love having an xperia again!
apple is an evil company_comma_ they just become a trillion dollar company today. i feel they betray their customer base by releasing the same phone every year
and everything the release they claim tis groundbreaking wile other phones had the same features for eyars
I din't do well in Biology last semester. I am ready for this one though
Biology of Cells. IT was so confusing.
College course are so much more detailed than high school. I did pass but barely.
Cool. I'm way better at math_comma_ but I'm gonna try to at least get a B this sester because I need the class.
I had a memory pop up on my facebook the other day it was a photo of my hands_comma_ and my moms hand. I was taking care of her during her last days. 
Yeah its okay it happens thats life! I enjoyed being able to know I was the one making sure she was okay as she went! 
A lady left her young kid in the car yesterday alone in front of the gas station. I would have video taped it but my mom told me after she left. Anything could've happened..and too boot- we are in the ghetto.
My mom saw it when she came out- It was hot out too- child in a car seat..YOUNG- Screaming. Seriously? I just don't get it- Even in a nice town your child can get stolen in a second.
Lol! Good workout though!
I was upset when I did not get a bonus at work. I just thought that I would get it
Yeah_comma_ I am hopeful
My house has been on the market for 3 months_comma_ and our market is so BAD! I figured oh it'll take a year or no one will buy it - but I got an offer on it a few days ago! 
It was decent_comma_ better than none I suppose! It was actually an offer from my neighbor! 
In these uncertain times_comma_ it's easy to be happy that I have a roof over my head.
I think we can find little things to be thankful for wherever we look.
It makees me sad that some people can't afford school clothes for their children.
I donated supplies this year. Maybe next year I will be able to donate uniforms. 
I hope I can afford it_comma_ but I definitely will if I can.
School starts back next Thursday. I have two kids going in and this is the first year that I have felt completely ready.
Yes it does! The kids are still little so they have no idea what it really takes.
Last week was my parents anniversary. e had a family dinner for them with my siblings and I.
40 years. I was designated the cook and almost burned the house down!
I'm not very experienced. No one was hurt and the kitchen was fine. We will be catering next time though.
I saw an old guy riding his scooter the other day..but on the ROAD to the grocery store. I felt so bad for him and wondered why he didn't have any family to help.
It is! I try to help when I am able.
My friends all went back to college and now I have no one to hang out with.
I don't_comma_ I'm working right now because I'm not sure what I want to major in.
Not to gross you out but I heard some stuff about periods the other day on a favorite youtube channel and boy did it remind me of the struggles as a teen! Good and bad times
lol! Everything seemed like the end of the world as a teen! I don't miss that part of it but I do miss some things
I just knew I was going to pass my history test. I had listened and studied all year
Yeah_comma_ it can be hard but I made it through
I have older animals and I will do whatever is needed to ensure they are healthy. I work so they can have a good life
They deserve it. They are so innocent.
 I had to get rid of my animals when I meant my wife due to her allergies. It was really difficult. 
I had 2... I had them for years. It really sucked but we tried for almost 2 years_comma_ and her allergies were insanely bad to the point of hospital visits. 
Me and my girlfriend broke up
A pretty big mix.  It's probably best its over.
Indeed_comma_ time to get back into the dating scene.
I can't wait to see how my daughters turn out as adults.
So_comma_ you've got daughters too?
I keep everything my kids make.
There is so much of it now. I have so many boxes lol
4 and 5 and I have a teenager
I  was super stoked when my mom brought me dinner the other day and she knew just what I wanted_comma_ without asking.
True! Moms are so giving and selfless. Mine is all the time.
I am normally very relaxed_comma_ happy and laid back.  Everything in life just seems right!
I just have a generally easy going outlook on things in my life.
You can!  Just be happy with what you have and that you are alive!
A man in our community was hit by a drunk driver the other night while walking his dog_comma_ he didn't survive. It's very heartbreaking.
Who knows_comma_ I hope he gets the book thrown at him!
Security at the grocery store followed me to my car the other day.
I had opened a soda while shopping and did not pay when I checked out. They thought I was stealing
I did. I wish the check out lady had reminded me. I wouldnt steal a soda.
It was. That has never happened to me before. People were staring.
My son's football team did not perform well at all during the season_comma_ but they still got to do a tournament at the end.
They ended up winning all the tournament games!
I am shocked the US hockey team won hold in 1980.
They beat Sweden in the finals.
 felt really nervous when I took my driving test
Yes!  I did!
I was pretty let down when I didn't get a good raise
I am working harder to get another job
My daughter is very good at spelling.

Of course. The other guy didn't though. A whole lot of his problem_comma_ not mine.
MY sister used to be my next door neighbor.
She moved all the way across the city. I hardly see my neice anymore.
Yes I do. My niece. Not my sister lol
My boyfriend cheated on me with my best friend! Why would he do that??
He is worse than a jerk_comma_ that's for sure.
I have wanted every career out there. You name it
I can never make up my mind on anything. I just want  a good job now. Those days are gone.
I am in school_comma_ but I have changed my major three times already. We
My co workers keeps getting rated as number 1 at work_comma_ but I know hes doing the work dirty to get such a rating. 
I turned him in and they didnt do anything because they dont care. It helps them generate money as well. 
I hit my goal weight of 180lbs
Say no to booze_comma_ stop eating garbage_comma_ meal prep.
It wasn't bad at all. and making all your own food saves money.
I felt nervous before I rode on an airplane for the first time
YOu should try it.  It reall was fun
I'm looking forward to next year when my finances get better.
I hope it's a big improvement for us both.
 I was floored when I found out I won an award at work
It was for most improved!
I'm very self conscious about being an ex con
Thank You_comma_ the worst part is that I was wrongfully convicted.
no_comma_ I've already done my time.
I accidentally called my girlfriend my ex-girlfriend's name.
I was ashamed. She yelled curse words at me.
I was pretty confident that I was going to place in the top ten of the marathon
I did.  I actually cacme in 3rd!
I don't think I ever want to go on a cruise. I always hear about entire ships breaking out with sickness and it sounds awful.
Yeah_comma_ too many scary things can go wrong!
My neighbor keeps parking in my parking spot! 
I have asked him a few times_comma_ but he obviously doesnt care. 
The other day I backed out of a parking spot and tapped a parked car.  It left a dent bit I left without notifying the owner.  It was not an action I am proud of.
I didn't want to take responsibility_comma_ which I know is wrong.  
Yeah_comma_ I feel horrible and small for doing that and not fessing up.
A time I felt lonely was when I joined a video game lobby. There was not a single person in it and I felt alone...
Yeah_comma_ it was weird. When I joined it said 3/25 people but when I got in it_comma_ there was no one. 
My two daughters are musicians.
violin and piano
I forgot my wallet the other day_comma_ and of course didnt remember it until I was about to pay at the cashiers line! 
Yup_comma_ and have everyone behind me annoyed with me and all of that fun adult stuff!! 
Someone cut me off in traffic the other day.
Definitely_comma_ I didn't lay on the horn though_comma_ that just makes it worse.
I ate a restaurant this morning and had soup. Their Sriracha bottle looked like it was 1000 years old and I wanted to vomit.
Not from that bottle at least.
I feel bad I lied to my friend.
I told him I couldn't hang out cause I was sick_comma_ but it was a lie.
I walked home one day after work and saw that my window had been smashed out.
Some guy climbed through and stole a bunch of stuff from my living room but that was it.
Yeah he ended up getting caught but they never found a lot of my stuff.
I was a little on edge when I dropped my daughter off at a movie with her friend alone for the first time
SHe had never gone to a movie without a parent
I've been feeling down a lot lately.
Finances mostly stressing me out.
I used the bathroom at a grocery store and had to poop really bad. I commenced pooping and starting humming a song and didn't realize there was a person 2 stalls down from me.
Yeah_comma_ it was very embarrassing. I swear to god_comma_ I thought I was the only one there!
I lied to my mother so I didn't have to take her to the doctor's by saying I had an appointment of my own. I think that was pretty crappy of me.
Nothing_comma_ I didn't feel like going.
I have a co-worker who's totally incompetent that makes more money than I do.
Incredibly so.
No raises here. You basically get what you're hired on at.
You know being a parent is so hard_comma_ but I feel so lucky to have my children especially in stressful times... 
when you need them the most they are there_comma_ i hope they always keep that same attitude as they get older. 
I just found a wasp nest out side of my apartment.
I told the landlord. They are so slow about things. I have to use the back door. I am afraid of wasps
I wish I had the guts to do that. They will try to come in my house for revenge if I did.
I woke up today and took a warm hot shower. I was so thankful for warm water_comma_ let alone being able to shower. 
I know_comma_ I try to be a lot more grateful everyday because you never know when you might lose it all.
I was terrified when I heard strange noises outside that seemed really close
My neighbor was working on his car loudly
I heard a buzzing in my apartment this morning. I swear to god_comma_ it was the biggest wasp I had ever seen in my life. I was so frightened!
Yes_comma_ I hate wasps. I can handle bees but wasps? Nope.
I am going to disney land in a month! I think I might be more happy than my daughter... 
I considered leaving her home so I could really enjoy the full experience myself_comma_ but I guess since shes only 2 I have to bring her with me. 
I was not happy when I didn't win the award.
It was for math student of the year.
I am so thankful for the sun. It gives us sunlight for food_comma_ warmth_comma_ and so much more
You gotta be careful_comma_ you might skin cancer if you do it too much.
I literally had the worst day every yesterday at work_comma_ but when I came home my entire night was made perfect! Guess what I had waiting for me? 
A spotless clean home_comma_ and HOT dinner on the table. Its priceless to get hot food when you are a mom. lol 
I can't wait for the new Venom movie to come out! I'm a big fan of Tom Hardy!
It's gonna be so good. Evil spiderman!!!

I've been thinking back to my childhood lately.
I'm like that much of the time.
I have been single for quite some time now_comma_ but I know its not over for me
Yep. I am determined to get married before I die lol
What's wrong with marriage? I'm not trying to jump obviously but I think it would be nice.
I watched the first Spiderman with Tobey Mcguire yesterday. Such a flashback to the past.
Me too_comma_ last time I saw it I was a little kid. It was very nostalgic
I was really excited when Friday came
I was headed to vacation at the end of the workday
I ordered a lot of food from a restaurant with coupons yesterday. When I got the food_comma_ they didn't even ask for the coupons! I did not expect it.
Yes_comma_ I got the discounts but I think they forgot to ask for the coupons. I get to save it for another time haha.
A few weeks ago it was the anniversary of my mothers death and it never gets any easier. 
I am sure you already do but just spoil her a lot and always let her know you care! I wish I had more time to do all of those things for her. 
My family is always there for me when I've needed them.
of course_comma_ that's my wife and children. my parents suck.
they've lied to me since the day I was born_comma_ they stole from me_comma_ they framed me for crimes they committed_comma_ they stood by and let me go to prison for what they did.
I need to get a job with real benefits soon_comma_ I'm very optimistic for the future.
Thank you. I'm still figuring everything out
My two daughters make me happy in my life.
I've never experienced anything as nice.
I finally thought my dog how to sit and give me her paw. I felt very accomplished and happy!
Like 7 months or something? She's still a puppy but she never listens so when she finally learned something_comma_ I was so excited!!
I was really touched to watch my daughter program
She was in a program for choir. She did great
My friend just got her license_comma_ and we live in a busy city but I think shes going to be okay driving. 
Especially in ours the drivers are terrible here no one uses the signal light! Thanks! 
I lost a lot of my muscle mass because I lost motivation and stopped lifting weights. I used to be a decent size in the past so that gives me assurance that I can get back to being big like before.
Maybe but from what I heard_comma_ you still have the muscle memory in your fibers to get big so it should be easier.
My dad bought me my first car_comma_ and I wont ever forget how happy I was. 
Yeah for sure I wont forget it! Sounds like you have an experience to remember too! 
I got everything I need for a quality work session this morning. My coffee_comma_ a hot shower_comma_ and some food/water. Should be an efficient day!
Thank you. Do you have a morning ritual like me also?
I got startled the other day while walking in my yard.
No_comma_ startled...by a snake in the yard.
I was pretty shaken up when my son didn't get home on time and I couldn't reach him
He is 17 and is usually on time
I peed in the sink because the bathrooms were full and i really had to go
no they couldnt the way the kitchen sink was situated. but i did not want to hold it in too much longer
I decided to finally step it up_comma_ and work on my fitness routine to achieve results. 
I am with myself_comma_ and sure I am going to follow through! 
I submitted a form to receive notifications for my banking app. I don't know why but the waiting got me feeling antsy.."
I know right. The anticipation is killing me
I am ready for my bar exam.
No_comma_ to be a lawyer/
A little random but when I was a kid I wanted the new Hulk movie that came out. I went to the store and I picked out the DVD and begged my mom to buy it. She did and I went home to play it on the TV. Turns out I bought the old 1980's version and I was so disappointed!
Hell no! It was terrible and I was so embarrassed at picking the old version instead of the new one.
My friends went out last night without me_comma_ and didnt even bother to ask me if I wanted to join them. 
Yeah it made me feel really bad especially since im new to the area. 
I am felling so chill right now since I have most of my bills paid
It really is.  My side gig reaally helps me out
I can't wait for the new Insurgency Sandstorm video game to come out on Steam. It was supposed to come out this summer but no news yet.

I am upset the baseball game got canceled.
Yes_comma_ it was to see who made the playoffs.
I don't have a car anymore but I am satisfied without having one. I don't drive a lot anyway and everything I need is in walking distance.
I guess for some places it's really mandatory but I honestly didn't need one to begin with.
I finally have a closing date on my home_comma_ and i cant wait! 
thank you! yes its a great feeling. i love it 
my friend was speeding because he wanted to show off his new car to me
The new Audi R8 it was used 2015
I owe my friend a pretty big amount of money. I was supposed to pay this week but they said they will give me another month. Did not expect that at all.
I know_comma_ I am so surprised they gave me another month. I am thankful for his understanding.
Back when I was in the Navy_comma_ I hated studying for promotion tests_comma_ so you can imagine my reaction when I got selected.
I must have been_comma_ because I always was promoted the first time I was eligible!
Thanks.  I should give a little credit to all the people who mentored me.
I hate it when you have to wait for the results of creating a new bank account. The waiting is killing me!
No idea_comma_ I'm checking my email everyday waiting for the results.
I remember one night I was hanging out with friends_comma_ and got a phone call that the ambulance was at my parents home. 
I found out he had a stroke due to the heat ( also his breathing problems COPD ) 
He actually passed away - his body went into a medical coma and we had to pull the ventilator. 
 I felt bad when I had to drop my son off for daycare the first time
It really is.  Tougher for parents sometimes I think
was proud of my child_comma_ she got all a's in school this year
hope she continues it into this year
I lied to one of my friends_comma_ and I feel bad about it. I just  dont know how to tell her the truth. 
Ugh... shes literally about to get married and her boyfriend has been cheating on her. I am scared to even bring it up. 
I found a biggest spider in my shower this morning. I never knew I could shriek like that..
I killed it but it took a lot of courage and hesitation haha
Public speeches always get me. It makes me very nervous and I just can't do them.
I will start speaking gibberish and sweat bad. Not only that but my face turns so red!!!
I was playing baseball and failed to catch the ball_comma_ which smacked me right in my mouth and broke one of my teeth! I just wanted to run and hide!
I do_comma_ but it can't pay for my emotional scarring! I felt like an idiot. I don't know if I can go to the next game now.
I don't have a car anymore but I'm perfectly fine with a bike now. Everything I need is pretty close to my house.
I agree! I need to start being more active anymore so there's that.
I didnt cheat on my diet even tho I was tempted at a party yesterday... 
I am I am! Its so hard but I am. 
I was really excited to see all my daughter's hard work pay off at the recital
She did really well_comma_  It was so special to see
I procrastinated and didn't do the dishes for a couple days now. I think fungus started to grow on some of the old food_comma_ so nasty!
I had to hold my nose shut while doing the dishes. 
I've been single for some time now. It really sucks...
A couple years_comma_ I think it's mainly my fault though for not putting myself out there.
I've been a bit down lately.
Work has been really slow this summer.
My brother asked me if I was the one who took his sunglasses. I did take his glasses but I told him no and now I feel bad.
I mean I planned on just returning it where it was but the guilt is still there.
I hope I will be able to afford a vacation during Christmas break for my kids
I was just going to look up what deals they had going on closer to that time and depending on how much money I save
My mother needed help moving out of her house and I ignored her call while at a party. I feel so bad because there is no way she and my dad would be able to move the giant furniture..
I called her back but she told me in an angry way that they already moved everything and my help was not needed anymore. I feel so ashamed.
I'm always trusting of my wife and daughters.
We are pretty much_comma_ but we've had to be as the rest of our family on both sides sucks.
Driving always scares me. I've seen some pretty bad car accidents with fatal injuries on the internet and it always crosses my mind while driving.
Drunk drivers are the worst too
I was shocked when I wsa told my boss was let go
The wouldn't tell us but I thought it was terrible
I did not expect France to win the World Cup. It's been a while but I still can't believe it considering a lot better teams made it to the semi play offs.
I need to start playing soccer again_comma_ I don't know why I stopped.
I was really upse when I found out my co-worker was fired
Kind of.  They maxxed out on the amount of points they had from lates and absences
I am thankful for my dog. Whenever I am lonely_comma_ she comforts me and I feel happy again!
She is a Spanish Bichon Frise. Her breed of dogs won 1st place at the World Dog Show this year! Take that other dogs!
My parents have been a big letdown in my life.
my mother framed me for a crime she committed.
I finally got to see my favorite baseball time team play in person. It was a dream come true.
This was major league. It could not have been a better experience than it was.
I just had crab legs for lunch.
It is totally different. I feel bad because I ate so man with so much butter. I'm supposed to be on a diet :(
I will do better next week. I'm already doomed for this one lol
I always feel bad whenever I cheat on my diet. It's so hard to disciplined with all the temptations around me.
Yes! I need to start doing that!
I was so happy I got to see my cousins when they came in town
34 and 27
I lost my wallet at a store that I frequent near my home.
I didn't. I can't believe no one returned it. Now I have to replace verything

I had the worst and busiest day at work yesterday_comma_ and when I came home my house was a mess because my wife decided she didnt want to do anything that day.

Whenever I see homeless people_comma_ I am so thankful for where I am in life. That could easily have been me_comma_ they just got the bad roll of the die.
I know_comma_ it makes me feel so grateful for the things I have and my circumstances.
I was overcharged at the grocery store but did not realize it until I got home. 
The bank can't help. I had to go back to the store. It's such a hassle but I want my money.
I can't until next summer! This past summer was such a happy moment in my life!
I got to see a lot of my favorite movies I've been waiting for and a lot of great concerts! I am anticipating next summer and cant wait!

I hope I go to heaven.
I am really looking forward to fall already
Yes! and tailgating!
I am ready for prom.
Yes_comma_ my girlfriend.
I listened to some old music I used to listen to recently. It literally made me feel like I was reliving the past!
You know how they say sound and smell are the senses that are used to remember memories the most? That is so true.
A lot of people have no concept of personal space anymore.
especially at the checkout line at a store.
I had to fart in a meeting room and it ended up being really loud.... and there was a lul in the conversation so everyone heard it
Yep
Everyone laughed it off... I guess I'll live.
I like collecting survival items in case of an emergency! I will be ready for any disaster or zombie Apocalypse that comes my way!

I hate it when I see people get bullied. It makes me so furious!
Are you a bully!
I do not like being bothered when I am working.
I try to shut my door but people still knock on it.
I've done a lot of extra work this summer.
Mostly around the house stuff_comma_ that gets let go the rest of the year.

Thank you. I'm trying to take baby steps and make slow progress.
I went to go visit my sister in Vegas last month.
We went to lots of cool shows. Leading up to the trip I was counting down the days and planning itinerary.
I was really proud of my sister when she graduated
It is.  I am pretty happy for her.

I haven't heard back from my mom yet. Wonder if she's ok
She's at Best Buy trying to get her computer fixed. I hope they don't take advantage of her.
My friend's dog started vomiting a lot. He's at the vet right now.
I hope so_comma_ too. We're waiting to hear back.
Everyone is my neighborhood has a nicer car than me.
Very much so. It's petty but I can't afford a new car. I feel out of pplace lol
That's a good way to look at it. Im not going to strain my pockets trying to fit in
On my way home from work today I had to wait a really long time for the train the ended up being super crowded due to a police investigation somewhere down the line.
Apparently it had to do with an unahtorized person on the tracks
I was shocked when I realized I had a $100 bill in an old pocket
Actually I used it to take the kids to a water park
I am very happy when I spend time with my girlfriend.
We truly are. After a few bad ones I think I am truly in love.
i went rock climbing_comma_ and remembered I used to climb with my brother all the time
Rock climbing is actually not scary unless you're afraid of heights of course.
My friend got me a new phone.
It is. I didn't even ask for it_comma_ and it's not a special occasion.
I tried to reach out to my estranged mom_comma_ but she insulted me and refused to speak to me.
It's okay_comma_ I'm used to it_comma_ it's been six years since we've seen each other.
Haven't seen my friends in a while_comma_ we had such a great time at the lake.
3 years ago.
I made a mistake at work but everyone blamed a coworker. I feel so bad about ir.
I am too afraid of the consequences and I think it is too late.
I missed my friend's phone call. Her car broke down.
Yea. She walked to the nearest gas station.
I had such a nice time with my aunt going through my uncles things after he passed
He had a lot of letters that he kept and he had old collectors items
I haven't seen my grandma in 5 years. I'm so excited she's coming to visit.
What's your grandma like?
You would not believe this girl! I was at my kid's graduation. Afterwards_comma_ my mom and I went up to congratulate him. I was just about to hug him and one of his ex's pushed me and my mom out of the way_comma_ jumped on him_comma_ and wouldn't let him go for 10 minutes!
I was so irritated. She was sobbing hysterically. And my poor son just stood there not knowing what to do
My mom finally went in between them and said "I think you have had long enough. If he wanted you on him he would have asked you to be here. It's his mom's turn"
The new Call of duty is going to be the bomb
Sure did. I'm playing on release day and gonna kill it!
I think so. I think that every year though lol
I was digging my nose thinking I was alone.
hahah do you now
My dad is coming into town. Haven't seen the guy in 5 years
Yea_comma_ he's some timezones away.
I was not impressed when I realized that I left my badge at home
It was a little difficult to get into work without it
I ruined dinner tonight I feel bad.
I forgot to put up the leftovers last night and the food was no good.
Well I'm not. And I can't afford to be sick and miss work either.
That's exactly what I did lol
I've been letting a stranger stay with us this past couple of days
Seems like they were really down on their luck. I felt really bad for them.
I hate trying to apply for jobs_comma_ putting so much effort into it_comma_ and then not getting any sort of response back. It's like_comma_ yeah_comma_ okay_comma_ I understand if you can't hire me_comma_ but can you at least tell me that you're denying me_comma_ and maybe why_comma_ too?
Yeah_comma_ I'm starting to feel that way. How long ago was it that you had to do a job hunt?
I've been waiting for a story to finish_comma_ but the author passed away
Yea_comma_ now I try to read completed works lol.
My dad just walked in with a piece of cheesecake only for himself! Cheesecake is my favorite dessert! I really wish I could have gone to Cheesecake Factory with him.
Yeah_comma_ it's alright. He's been a little sad lately since he just recently retired_comma_ so I'm glad he's enjoying himself. I won't give him too much crap about it.
It warms my heart to have my parents to have such a good relationship with my kids
It really is.  Does your family live close to you?
My girlfriend is going on vacation out of the country with her friends for 2 weeks
Try not to worry and trust her.
My exroommate was horrible! He refused to shower. We were lucky to get 1 shower a week out of him. And he refused to clean up after himself
He smelled so bad! And before I moved out_comma_ he had dishes with food in them from over a month before
We can only hope so.
MY kids are gonna take care of me when I get older. I just know it
I'm just wishing they would. I do a lot for them and I hope they appreciate it lol
Lol. I should do that too. And say you still have to do what I say because I will always be the parent lol
I know right
I thought I saw a bat in my kitchen last night
It was a big moth. I'm just afraid of everything. My daughter just opened the door and let it out lol. She is my hero
Even my 4 year old wasn't afraid. How embarassing
I was about to go to bed when my mother in law called with the shocking news that my sister in law was pregnant.
Because I never expected her to get pregnant so young.
My friend is at Chipotle getting me some burritos.
Their sofritas with extra everything.
I am anticipating a really long day tomorrow and it makes me nervous
It is going to be really busy and hard to get out of work probably
I took a statewide licensing test last week. I had to study really hard for it. But in the end I was rewarded quite well. I got the highest score in the entire state!
No it doesn't affect my insurance rates in any way.
I was on a long walk and couldnt get home on time to get to the bathroom.
Nope_comma_ not at all unfortunately.
The first time I spent the weekend at my boyfriend's appointment_comma_ I was greeted by flowers all through the apartment and my dog had treats and toys waiting for him
It really was so sweet. He still spoils us rotten. I haven't quite gotten used to it yet lol
lol He does_comma_ in fact!
Saw this guy ate 3 bowls of large pho.
They ate it like it was nothing. Damn.
On the way home on my bike_comma_ I couldn't hold it in any longer and I... went to the bathroom on myself. #2. It was horrible. I had another mile to go before I got back to my house. So much to clean up. I felt so mortified!
Yeah_comma_ the bike was easy to clean_comma_ for sure. Took like two minutes. Myself on the other hand... Not so much. And the clothes_comma_ I almost wanted to throw them away but the jeans are my favorite_comma_ so I decided against it. They might not be my favorite anymore though...
It's birthday soon. I want to be a better person.
Yea_comma_ i will!
I miss when my toddlers were tiny babies.
3 and 4. They don't listen and waste crumbs when they aren't even eating anything. I don't understand it.
Like I said. They don't listen lol
My neighbor's party is still going on. I need to wake up early tomorrow.
Around 9pm.
I lie to my boyfriend constantly.
I always tell him I'm broke so I don't have to spend my own money. That's bad I know
I hope so. 
My son just left for the Army. He is going to have an amazing career.
This go round it will only be for a few months. But the next time he leaves will be a lot longer.
I already miss him like crazy. But_comma_ I know he was born to do this.
Let my 16 year old brother borrow my car to take his date out.
Yea_comma_ he was very responsible with it.
Had to give a presentation for my group at school. Think I did well.
Oh yea_comma_ I'm super nervous in front of a lot of people_comma_ but I prepared a lot.
Someone in my family snuck $20 out of my wallet without asking me. It had to be one of them_comma_ because it's been here on the counter all day_comma_ and I know I definitely had two $20 bills in there. No one will own up to it...
I don't know. Maybe not. It hasn't really happened before_comma_ so I'm not too beat up about it. But I'm a struggling college student_comma_ so every bit counts. It was probably my teenage sister. I'd rather not create a lot of loud drama.
I remember when the Ice Cream Man used to come down my childhood street.
It really takes me back to the good old days.
You wanna know what takes me back to those days?
Totinos pizza rolls. I still eat them today
Don't get me started. I ate a Toaster Strudel every morning lol
Have kids so you can say you're buying those snacks for them. That's what I did lol
I was shocked when I realized I left my door open at night
It was wide open 
I think my brother's children are going to have to be put up for adoption soon. He and his wife just aren't fit for parenting_comma_ as they fight and get drunk all the time. It's a shame_comma_ because I love the two nephews myself_comma_ and I hate the thought of not being able to see them again. But it may be for the best...
I think they'll be forced to_comma_ eventually. They've already had the department of social services involved_comma_ but they always end up getting the children back. At some point_comma_ reality is really going to set in and they'll lose their children.
Yesterday I was notified that I did not receive a promotion at work. Really sucked.
I'm not sure. I'm so depressed that I don't know what to do now.
My husband always stops at the store on his way home from work. 
Mainly groceries_comma_ but he always wanders through the clearance aisles of toys and gadgets and takes forever_comma_ while we just sit and wait on him to eat dinner.
My parents threw a surprise party for me last night. I was so happy!
Me too! They are a ton of fun. I was so shocked and I got a bunch of cool gifts.
MY ex has a gambling problem. Thats why we broke up
He play slot machines only. We broke up two years ago and he still hasn't gotten it together. He asked me for help with his car note the other day. I'm no enabler.
Exactly. He is just doomed. 
I am mad at the democrats.
The country needs a border wall with Mexico and the dims keep blocking the resolution
I am so mad at my cable company!  My internet and TV keeps going out and their technicians are incompetent!
Yeah_comma_ but they never credit me anything for the lost service time!  It makes me see red!
Pretty excited to go shopping
There is a lot of great sales. We will see
It felt great to see my son graduate. Like I succeeded as a parent.
Yes. College is the next big step!
My youngest daughter got the last spot in her pre k class.
No they only have room for so many kids and I felt bad because I waited so late. She almost got waitlisted.
Very lucky. I won't make that mistake again
I found out my baby didn't weigh enough so I devoted my time to helping him catch up.
He is weighing enough now luckily_comma_ but he seems a little skinny in some spots to me still.
I couldn't believe how nice that car was!  She did really well getting that new car.
Yeah and she bought it the day of our trip so we didn't have to worry about driving an older ride.  Worked out great.
There once was a hurricane approaching my area.
I am so happy I was ready for it.
No_comma_ just a few trees fell in the front yard. Thank goodness.
My little boy is testing to see if he can get into a prestigious private school. Really hope he gets into it before the school year starts! If he does_comma_ they say kids from these schools are set and will easily get into a good college
Me too! It would be crazy expensive_comma_ but it's something I want to do for him because I know it will give him such a crazy good foundation for the later stages of life. If I can see him through this_comma_ then I will have half of my job as a father done.
I can't wait for the new season of this is us
It is. It is literally one of the best shows I have ever seen and I 've seen plenty.
You wouldn't believe I got too scared watching the first episode of that show. My daughter still watches it though
I am starting my new job tomorrow. I've never been so nervous in my life.
It's a really high paying one to boot - $3/hour. I just don't want to mess it up!
Four more days and the kids ar back in school!! yay
Enjoy silence for a while. Then I don't know lol_comma_ but I cant wait!
75% of the time
 I stayed home from work today because my son was sick
I haven’t called in before so it was no big deal
You ever had strawberry shortcake ice cream?
Yes that's it.
I don't believe you. I used to eat them all the time as a kid
The ice cream truck didn come here. My grandmother used to buy boxes of them for us.
I think I'm getting new neighbors.
Well_comma_ I know. Some moved in a couch earlier. I just hope they aren't jerks
Every neighbor I've had in that apartment have been jerks.
5 years
Took the trash out yesterday and it burst all over the ground. I was pretty peeved.
Yeah_comma_ it did once I cleaned it up. But it was pretty nasty when I had to do that. Garbage and possums were everywhere!
I proposed to my girlfriend the other day and she said yes!
I am so happy!  We have been together for two years.
Do it! She will be so grateful!
I went to his 8th grade graduation.  Such a handsome boy and I'm glad he's doing good in school.  He's going to high school now!
My nephew!  Sorry_comma_ I forgot to mention that.  He's growing up so fast :D
Well I have worked hard and lost some weight and toned up a bit after a year of not working out. I finally feel good when I go out in public instead of gross
Oh about 70lbs. I got in very bad health and had a bad health issue with pregnancy it's been a battle but after 6 months_comma_ I finally feel like an attractive woman when going outside. Its hard when you don't feel you look good
I got up on stage and completely made a fool of myself
I was at the community theater
I did right off the bat
MY kids go so crazy when they have any sugar.
these people at work are so disrespectful and racist!! I can't wait till i quit! I'm an armed guard and they want me to help customers to find products and i'm not there for that!!
i understand_comma_ but i'm there to make sure everybody is safe. if i start helping customers i might miss a person getting a gun out or something like that
I ran a red light yesterday because I didn't think anyone was out on the road at 2AM. But a cop managed to nail me.
I did get a ticket. I was so embarrassed because it was the first time I ever got one.
I am upset the Jonas Brothers broke up.
Yes_comma_ I cried for weeks when I found out.
My baby walked for the first time just the other day.
No_comma_ I didn't have my phone with me but I am so delighted it happened!
Yes_comma_ he is the love of my life!
I get scared when moving to a new neighborhood.
Well sometimes I think new people are targets for crazy things.
Yeah. Im weird. 
I have a physics test tomorrow that I have been studying for non stop. I feel really good about it.
Yeah_comma_ it's a pretty tough course_comma_ but a lot of studying goes a long way.
I am looking forward to graduating next year.
Criminal Justice.
I have no idea. I just want to graduate and make moeny lol
My grandma died last month and now we are sorting through her things.
It has been kind of fun going through all of her old family photo albums though. 
I was going to have a baby and I wanted to do it without medication. i was not sure if I'd be strong enough but I was optimistic stil
I didn't end up making it haha but I went further then I had in any of my previous pregnancies at least. 
I can't wait to get out of these work clothes and into my sweats
Darn right it is
MY new neighbors just moved in downstairs.
No but its late and they are putting pictures or something on the wall. All I hear is the hammer.
I know
I am so upset.
I ordered food from Uber Eats and it neve came.
I don't know what happened. It said that it was picked up and then nothing.
After two hours with customer service. I'm still hungry!
Im taking my daughter for school clothes
13 and she wants to go to thrift stores!
Sure will. I hope she picks cute stuff still
She like black and red so no style at all lol
I start my new job as a social worker in one week! I'm a little anxious about it because I don't want to mess up_comma_ but also it feels good to finally be able to put my education to use (and make a living_comma_ of course).
Thanks! I appreciate that. I was kind of nervous at first that I was choosing the wrong career path_comma_ but I think it will be cool. I'm not too money-obsessed_comma_ so a profession that helps others while not earning a ton of money is okay with me.
I had an argument and lost my temper.
Things with my spouse.
I still have the first Valentine my daughter ever gave me
She is 13 now
I think she was 4. lol
I got onions on my burger I order today and I hate onions
Obviously I didn't ask for them
I specifically asked for no onions
I got a new burger but my apetite was ruined by then
I've been feeling down since my pet died.
Thank you. I hope I feel better soon.
MY new neighbors have a nice car.
An infiniti. My old volvo is the worst on the block
I just haate that everyone is doing better than me. Im petty
I was shy when starting a new school. I did not know anyine
Yeah_comma_ I felt like that for awhile
My street almost flooded very bad up to my garage because of the heavy rain today. I have things in my garage that I wouldnt want to get wet and didnt even think it could flood.
Yeah expecially when its unexpected_comma_ like my house is about a foot above the level of the street but the storm drains go to a river which also floods so the drains dont work_comma_ I actually thing water from the river comes back through the drains!
I used to be the skinny one in my friend group.
They lost weight and I gained some lol
If I could I wouldnt be having this conversation
Yes but I am failing miserably
MY daughter painted me a picture the other day
It looked like something from a museum. I was really proud.
Maybe she doesnt need to lol
I am worried that my neighbor is starving his dogs.
The police don't even care if people shoot eachother here. All I can do is call AC but they are corrupt too. I don't know what to do besides call AC and hope they care. He hasn't let them outside in days and he has a bad mental illness.
Last night I ate 12 buckets of KFC. Feels bad man.
I am really not sure. I have an iron stomach built to digest pounds upon pounds of KFC. Although I did feel guilty of my gluttony.
I was a little nervous for placement testing
I am not sure.  I was sweating I was so nervous
My birthday is tomorrow and I am so stoked! I can't sleep because I am so hyped.
I am going to the bowling alley with some friends and family!
Its been almost a year since my granny passed. I miss her so much
We had a party for her birthday last month. It was lie she was there. We played her favorite music
I have been working really hard in school lately. 
Yes. I have a test coming up and I am sure I will ace it!
5
Sorry about that. I hit some wrong keys. It is a psychology class.
I miss living in the city.
Not really. Further outside of the city though. The neighborhood was getting rough.
Plus I have kids
I think you mean safe
Im glad I still have my parents around
That's true. I still get to be a baby sometimes.
I do. Every day
I felt alone when my friends were gone for the summer. I felt like I had no one to hang with
I found some hobbies and eventually got through it
I was hopeful when the raptors got khawi leonard
i hope so!
I felt contentment when my brother was going to get married. I just felt glad for him
Its coming up in the fall
I lied to my friend that I was busy last Friday night_comma_ but really all I wanted to do was stay home.
I really enjoy it. Most of the time I just want to Netflix and chill.
I am going to meet up with a special friend I haven't seen for years
We are meeting for breakfast on Saturday
I always donate my old things
I think its better to give some things instead of selling them.
I just sent some uniforms up to my kids old school. I would hate for some kids to not have uniforms.
"i was happy when Lebron signed with the lakers
yea i hope they take down the warriors
I get so frantic when I am late for appointments. I had an eye doctor appointment and was 15 minutes late. 
I thought the eye doctor was going to be upset_comma_ but they were fine with it. 
Good customer service is important to me.
I have always stayed loyal to stores who have great customer service. I can't spend my money somewhere where I am treated poorly
To an extent. You just don't have to be rude when people just want help
I have an interview for my potential job tomorrow and have been practicing in front of the mirror all day.
I feel quite prepared. Hopefully all this practicing pays off.
I went skydiving the other day and was so frightened to take the leap out of the plane.
It was indeed. I took the jump and was screaming the whole way down.
Whenever I see a very expensive car on the road_comma_ I get so envious! One day...
I love Porsches!
I'm going hiking with my friends tomorrow. I have everything I need and I forget bug spray like last time! I am ready!
A local trail about 5 mi from us. Last time I went_comma_ I forgot so many things. I am more than prepared this time!
So_comma_ I have a dark confession to make. I ate 24 burritos from Chipotle the other day. Felt so bad about myself.
I know_comma_ felt the same thing yesterday. They had to lift me to my car because I couldn't move at all.
I managed to bag 50 squirrels the other day when I was hunting. I felt marginally bad.
Of course! I am going to make a 25 pound squirrel pot pie and submit it to the country fair. I am also planning on making an exquisite fur coat to sell on etsy. I hope some hillbilly will buy it.
I stepped in dried dog poop today on my way to my car. It was so nasty!
Haha_comma_ maybe next time
My son spoke his first word yesterday. I was so impressed and proud.
He turns 1 this month! He is growing up so fast.
I can't wait to get paid on Saturday! I worked overtime 4 times this weekend and my check should be fat!
Yes I get great health benefits but I also love money!
I felt ready when I went to work
thats why when you got your stuff in order you can knock it out
I was really happen I got to keep my computer when i moved.
I did not think my girlfriend would let me take it.
I love that my extended family likes to keep everyone together
It really does.  They always plan the best activities
I was under the influence and facebooking LOL.  Not something that should go together but I was kinda mean to an ex coworker when she asked me to write a letter of recommendation for her
Yeah I sure did.  felt bad the next day after I had seen the conversation.  I then wrote that letter she wanted.
I was upset when i didnt win the lottery!
#metoo
Public speaking makes me so nervous! I get very sweaty and start to shake uncontrollably...
I'm trying to improve with self help books and online courses
My wedding is tomorrow and I've been going over my vows over and over. Never felt so ready!
Thanks man. Feels like I've been preparing for this day my whole life.
I ove binge watching tv shows
I love dramas. They leave you with a cliffhanger but you can watch the next show immediately lol
Does that still come on?
I am so thankful for simple things like clean water_comma_ some people in Africa have to walk miles just to get that!
I feel so grateful. I usually take the simple things in life for granted...
i gained so much weight and i look so horrible... it's embarrasing
yes_comma_ and i also stress eat. i can't control it
I am happy to have a home in a good neighborhood
3 years.  Costs more than I can afford but my kids are safe
I believe the lakers will crush the warriors!
no but i hope so!
I am so thankful for invention of cars! Can you imagine have to walk or take a bike to places very far away?
Me too_comma_ everything is so far nowadays. I am so grateful!
MY son went to the potty all by himself today.
I ws surprised because he is so stubborn
I wonder how he will do tomorrow
I am happy that the NFL season is starting!
oh thats cool
I had to attend a funeral and left my dog with a sitter.  When I came home 2 days later he was so happy to see me!  It warmed my heart ;)
I loved it.  He is so sweet.  Do you have any dogs?
It is so loney out here. My closest neighbor is two miles away
Its lonely and I always think I'm going to be murdered and end up on 20/20
I watch those shows too much
They are too good to not watch.
I don't have a car anymore but I'm ok with that. I'm perfectly fine with my bike because everything I need is very close to me
I agree. I am perfectly content with having to ride a bike at the moment.
I have always and will always be true to my loved ones. I would never jeopardize their trust.
I strive to be that kind of person. It is quite important to me.
Feeling lucky to not have plans
You got that right
My dad was recently diagnosed with diabetes. I'm really worried what this will mean for his health going forward. He's in his mid-60's and I want him to live as long as possible_comma_ but this obviously gets in the way of that.
Yeah_comma_ my dad has never been a veggies guy. Always sneaking too many desserts. He had a stroke earlier on in his life_comma_ too_comma_ which has always hampered him_comma_ and I think the medications for his heart condition led to the development of the diabetes. I feel sad for him.
There has been a fly in my room that won't stop landing on my face. I am about to lose it...
I know!!! It's like the fly loves to annoy me lol
So_comma_ I was eating dinner and my dad kept laughing during it_comma_ and I wondered why. Turns out he accidentally dropped the plate of meat on the ground outside after grilling it_comma_ but decided to serve it to us anyway!
Not to me it wasn't! I felt like something was off about the taste_comma_ too_comma_ like there was little grains of dirt or gravel or rock or something. And now I feel gross thinking about what else it could have touched_comma_ since our dogs poop in that yard.
I ate all of the ice cream last night.
I don't know. I do feel bad though because my kids didn't get any. Now I have to buy more
They don't need any sugar anyways
Im geting a new car this year.
I don't know. I don't have any money yet either. I jus know I am determined to get one before the year is over
See that's it
My mom has been very depressed lately with her work lately. They randomly changed her schedule and she is having a hard time adapting.
Yeah_comma_ she's not getting any younger too.
WE didn't swim all summer!
They never opened our pool.
I know and my kids really wanted to
I love watching old movies I've seen a long time ago. I notice things I didn't pick up on when I was young. It was like reliving the past.
It was a very nostalgic for sure.
My neigbors are terrible
They leave trash everywhere and so do their guests.
I don't want to start a fight though
I work in retail_comma_ but the otems arent that hot and the staff is rude.
I am. I dread going there tomorrow
My daughter said her first word yesterday. I was so proud.
What? No it isn't. It's good that she is learning how to talk.
My best friend is awesome.
I gave her my key while I was on vacation. I don't have any plants but she made sure no one broke into my house lol
Told ya
I was so scared when I watched the new Insidious movie. I am such a scaredy cat!
Yeah_comma_ I don't know what I was thinking.
I was let down when my aunt missed my graduation. I really wanted her tehre
She lived far away
I got a visit from my uncle I wasn't expecting
it really was
I was happy when my shift was over
just big plans to get hoMEEEEE!
I start camp this weekend
I am going to be a camp counselor
I am so ready for the camping trip this coming weekend. I made a list of what I need and I'm pretty sure I'm not forgetting anything.
The Great Smokey Mountains National Park_comma_ it's like 15 minutes from where I live. I am so prepared for it_comma_ it should be fun!
I was very envious when my friend got a new car that I wanted. It was just maddening
It was a 4runner
i was irked when the lakers got Lebron
they will when curry brakes his ankles
I am sure my neighbor will return my lawnmower in it's original condition.
I have faith he will. He is a good person.
I don't like anyone in my apartment unit.
My family doesn't live here. My neighbors are terrible and I wish I lived in this unit alone.
I don't have one. I know its bad but I just want this building to myself.
I forgot to let my dog back inside yesterday before I went to work.
Yes he did and we did not find him until the next morning. 
I was happy to see Lebron leave leave the cavs
i hate the cavs and dan gilbert!
I can't believe that I have such kind parents
They are always there for me and my kids
I also have a great parent. However I got a bit too mad at her when she threw away a lot of moneys worth of special vitamins accidentally.
No. I am poor so it's a big deal. However she did it absent minded-ly as they were in a big package. Still- I shouldn't have gotten so mad
I was saddened when my dad got in trouble. It just gave me some shame
He got a dwi
I ran a blatant red light today. I felt so bad about it afterwards because someone could have gotten seriously hurt.
I'm trying not to beat myself over it but I can't stop feeling so guilty over it. 
My family and friends threw a party for me out of the blue. Did not expect it at all and I felt so appreciated! It was an awesome night yesterday!
No but I got a promotion at my job recently and I did post about it on social media. The promotion and the party was definitely a surprise.
Yesterday I did something at work that I am not too proud of. I went in my coworkers desk and took some supplies. Now_comma_ it is eating me up inside.
Yeah_comma_ it probably is best to just confess.  I don't know if I could deal with it otherwise.
I was going to go to my son's AIT graduation with my parents. And then they said I could go but I couldn't take my service dog.
Not at all. They don't believe I have the disabilities nor do I need a service dog
It's not my choice either. I love my service dog but honestly I wish I had him as a pet and didn't need him as a service dog
MY sister was recently fired.
What's worse is she refuses to look for work now
Just being lazy I guess. Im not going to support her.
I am listening to some music I loved 5 years ago. I feel like traveled back in time_comma_ I miss the old days...
Electronic Dance Music
Had to attend a funeral of a family member in another state.  I haven't seen some of my family in a couple years or more.  It was nice getting to see them again.
haha yeah.  I didn't really know the deceased that well but my closer family asked me to be a pallbearer.  It was about a 5 hour drive to get there so it wasn't bad.  Haven't seen those people in forever.
The people that carry the casket
My brother got a brand new computer!
It's not awesome_comma_ because I did not get one.
My son won a contest and we got to go to an NFL game
It was awesome! Our tickets were on the 50 yard line right by the tv people
I told myself I wouldn't eat after 10 pm yesterday and I already broke my promise. I feel like I've let myself down_comma_ again.
I am so disappointed in myself. I can never do anything right!
What is ziplining?
I was happy when we were going to a new movie last weekend. I had waited all summer for it
Thew new mission impossible
I am pretty worried about being home alone
I am living alone with my kids but they will just be gone for the weekend
My two dogs got into a fight with each other_comma_ and now they're avoiding one another. They even drew blood on each other during the fight. They're usually good buddies_comma_ so it kind of bothers me that they did that
Not quite. They're not aggressive with one another_comma_ but they still haven't completely gotten back to the point where they're acting normal. I guess it's just a matter of time. They've been together four years_comma_ and that was the worst fight yet.
Yeah_comma_ they're fine. Thanks for asking!
I went to the store the other day and made a mistake.
I left with some candy that I forgot to pay for.
Here I am_comma_ another night all alone. You ever feel like you will be alone forever?
Yeah_comma_ I get those thoughts sometimes too but I feel like doing that would be so selfish. We need to think of our family and friends and how much they care about us
I pray that the sun rises for another day for me.
I gave everything I had to my relationship with another human_comma_ and in the end I was just thrown away. I can only pray it'll get better.
I had to get some medical tests done. Waiting for the results killed me.
Well... the tests showed I had cancer so...
I can't seem to keep any weight off. My friends can keep whatever they want and not gain anything! I am so frustrated...
I think it has something to do with my metabolism. Not really sure to be honest.
I get to babysit for my niece this weekend
She is 7 months old
My son used to give me such a hard time in the morning when he had to get up for school.
Thank goodness since he has gotten older he has grown out of that. 
Sometimes I hate my life because of certain circumstances but I've learned to be happy with what I have. I just need to be more grateful I think
Yeah_comma_ I've been learning to be content with what I have and who I am.
I was excited in a surprising way when my brother came to my graduation. I was not expecting him there
It was a decade ago
One of my best friend's other friends was talking bad about her to me.
I told the girl that she was wrong about what she was saying about my best friend. And then told my best friend what happened.
She was grateful I told her and confronted the other girl.
Have you ever just sat on the beach for a whole day?  It's so relaxing.
Aww!  So lucky!  A couple years ago I had to drive 9 hours just to get to the beach LOL.  Worth it though.
I get to snuggle all day with my little boy tomorrow
He had a fever at school this afternoon so they won't let him go even though he is feeling better
I had my 20th class reunion last year
Yeah. About half of our class. It was nice to catch up with everyone
I am very convinced that I have severe trust issues. It's really hurting my relationships with other people.
I am confident that it's because of my past relationships. Hopefully_comma_ I can learn to trust people more someday
I had food_comma_ water_comma_ and a place to sleep last night. I need to be more thankful for stuff like that that I take for granted...
Some people don't have the necessities and when I feel so down I try to be more grateful
I was mad when my mom wanted to get a divorce. My dad did so much for her
She was and I am not sure why she wanted to do that
hoping the lakers crush the warriors!

I had to drive 5 hours the other day to attend a funeral of a cousin of mine.  It was a sad day.  Got to see family though.

I remember back when my mom made me a birthday cake.
It was a German chocolate cake.  It really takes me back.
My ex roommate was so nasty. He refused to clean and only showered once a week
I refused to clean up after him. And I made sure I was there as little as possible. He smelled so bad_comma_'
I was sad when my grandma passed away. It was so random
She was in her 60s
Some random guy at the gas station asked me if I wanted to see a ninja flip so I thought it can't hurt to see what he was talking about for a few seconds. He did the most insane flip I have ever seen in my life!
Yeah I know. It takes a lot to impress me so I was pretty moved haha
I'm still single. I am optimistic that I will find the one for me soon...
Me too_comma_ I'm trying to do that
Make a point to do that even if you don’t feel like it
I can totally relate
My pet dog_comma_ Gabe_comma_ passed away recently. I have been so down lately because of it.

I didn't follow through on my diet plan and ate too much. I am feeling very let down
It's hard to stay disciplined sometimes with all the temptations around us
My girlfriend left me after a long time being together.
I dont want to ever find anyone else after that. People are trash.
My upstairs neighbor kids are so rambunctious and loud.
I completely agree! The parents don't watch the kids and let them do whatever they want. 
I was at the grocery store today and a very young bag boy helped an older man run his food card. He was having such a hard time.
Not in my neighborhood especially. The old guy took awhile. I didn't mind. He can't help it! It was nice to see people helping eachother to do things.
I was upset when one of my employees submitted his two weeks notice yesterday
too many outside distractions.. trying to run a church while working at his real job
Listening to feel good music makes me feel so good. I don't about you but music can really cure a lot of negative emotions
A lot of EDM. Music hippies listen to haha
I am getting everything together for my meeting tomorrow
A team meeting and I am presenting
I am very excited to work everyday.
I work from home. It is very interesting and it pays decent. No boss! Thats the best part.
My exhusband was a soldier who was gone a lot. It got lonely.
Unlike a lot of military wives_comma_ I didn't cheat though.
I am single and wish I had a girlfriend.
I just hate to be by myself.
 i was scared when my dog got loose
yes he came back later in the day all dazed and confused
I got angry at my brother one time when he ruined a football game score that I had recorded

I was torn away to hear that my dad was having health problems again. It's always so stressful
I hope so
Sometimes I feel all alone

I saw a homeless person today. I instantly felt so thankful for what I had in life and where I was.

Well_comma_ I love honesty and everything but I think someones sex life is private and I don't want to know about it in that context.
My best friend took me in when I escaped an abusive situation.
I agree. It makes it hard for a lot to leave.

I'm satisfied with how I'm doing physically right now. I just need to keep at it and stay motivated.
Just gotta keep doing the right things

I almost got into a car accident today. It was so close...
Yeah but it could have been bad
I trust my family way more than i should!
BIL didnt feed the dogs like he was supposed to while we were on vacation!
I am proud of my partner that is doing treatment and doing it on his own for once. He never has picked up anything to work on himself..BY himself before.
Yes_comma_ it's about time. It's hard to deal with people if they won't help themselves.
Yes!
I am not happy that he didn't go to jail.
He was drunk driving and killed her_comma_ but didn't go to jail.

Disgusting_comma_ that cap was so crusty it was unbelievable. I don't know why they don't replace them montly ugh

I'm starting a new job in September!
It's a plant manager job so I hope I get along with everyone. I'm somewhat scared that I wont
I went into the ladies room at the store today. It was so gross.
Not at all! Someone left a dirty diaper in the sink!
I am pretty happy today I would say.
I have been pining for a promotion at my workplace and I finally got it this afternoon!
I think it was my streak of not making any mistakes over the last few months if nothing else haha.
I've had my eye on a new laptop for ages_comma_ but I could never afford it until now!
ASUS. I've had a good luck streak with them that I hope will continue
I am really looking forward to my special dinner with my partner! Our ten year anniversary is coming up!
I made reservations at a restaurant with a beautiful view of the city. Very romantic and fancy!
Thank you! It's nice to celebrate those milestones with your loved ones when you can.
My favorite horse_comma_ Gracie_comma_ died the other day
Old age. I've had her since I was a child_comma_ so it's hard to take
How can I work so hard and not get a raise meanwhile others colleagues are. I am so jealous what do I do?
My boss is just being mean because I have better qualifications than him. He often tells me it's not the qualification that counts but experience :(
Ok_comma_ thanks for your advise_comma_ I will definitely do that
My son recently won a swim meet and got first place for butterfly stroke
3 years! It took a lot of training for him to get to this point! I'm so proud!
My mom left me over night with some of her friends when I was 8 years old. I cried myself to sleep. It wasn't until later in life I realized she could have been possibly cheating on my dad.
Yes_comma_ but she denies it. 
They stayed together 39 years and then my dad passed.
My mom decided to give me a precious family heirloom this past Christmas. It was quite unexpected!
Yes_comma_ I actually had seen my grandmother with it before. It is a beautiful jeweled ring.
I think I would be too nervous to wear it_comma_ so I will store it away for now.
I had to renew my drivers license by taking a test. I really wanted to be ready for it.
I studied hard and was ready. Passed with flying colors.
My pet hamster was eaten by a pit bull.
My hamster got loose in the yard and my neighbors dog ate it.  I can't handle this sadness.
My sister was a little bit depressed_comma_ so I bought her gift to cheer her up.
I bought a hotel stay for a weekend near the beach. I think that could help her.
After dating my girlfriend for 3 years she still won't accept my marriage proposal_comma_ I am so angry with her 
I think she is secretly cheating on me :(
She has been quite demanding lately_comma_ she wants to eat out in the most expensive resturants_comma_ she wants the most expensive cloths and jewelleris 
I am worried about having enough money for rent.
Yeah I don't have many days left to get $100.
I lost my favorite watch the other day.
Unfortunatly_comma_ yes. But that one had a lot of meaning to me as it was my father's. It hurts to not have it anymore
Last year my mother took me grocery shopping for my birthday
haha no.  I'm 35 years old.  I couldn't think of anything I wanted.  So she bought my groceries.  At this age I apprecite that kind of thing.
Exactly!  Was a wonderful surprise
Oh just stuff for my freezer and a lot of snacks.  Milk_comma_ eggs_comma_ etc.   A bunch of meat.   Some toiletries.  That stuff lasted me a few weeks!
I lost a game of DoTA today! I can't believe it_comma_ it wasn't even my fault.
My stupid teammates all left the game. I was doing really well but couldn't win by myself.
Once I went into a store only to realize that I had on two different shoes.
I was in a hurry and they did look similar. However it was obvious.
My dog was dying of old age
Thanks but I won't.
I am shocked at how fast my hair is growing these days
maybe that's the reason
In a few days I need to go to a company presentation and make a big speech!
I am! But_comma_ yes_comma_ you are right. I am extremely nervous about it. What if I mess up!
I ordered for a pizza_comma_she brought a hambugger_comma_i declined it _comma_she just yelled at me angrily 
Sure! It was uncalled for_comma_and unprofessional
I had my recent eye exam_comma_ and it went very well.

I am not so sure how I feel about buying a used car.

My wife just gave birth to a bouncing baby boy. I am going to be a proud father

I feel a bit down in the dumps now.
My computer suddenly stopped working yesterday_comma_ and I can't figure out why.
Yes_comma_ I think that is my logical next step to get it fixed. I hope they can fix it.
This lady behind me in Target was driving me insane. I can't believe it.
She was on her bluetooth screaming to the person she was talking to. So rude.
I got take out and when I got home I had an extra dessert. I was quite pleased
I wasn't expecting it but was glad to see it. I have quite the sweet tooth for chocolate cake.
All of my friends moved out of state after college_comma_ so I'm really the only one left
I do! But_comma_ for now_comma_ I do miss them and it makes me feel sad that they aren't around in person. Social media does help_comma_ though
Ugh_comma_ it is so frustrating when you pay extra for express delivery and the shipping company messed up!
Yes! That's why I have to stay on top of the package tracking because you never know when something could go wrong.
That's a smart idea! Hopefully I don't encounter issues like this again in the future.
I got my promotion_comma_ I am more than happy today
Yes It is. I am super excited :)
A small party with my family. You are also invited :)
This is ridiculous. I have to take my car to the shop again.
Some jerk rear ended me and now I need body work done. The clown didn't even have insurance! Its insane what people get away with.
I am feeling warm with good memories.
I watched a film the other night that reminded me of all the good times I had with my family when I was younger.
We had talked on phone a night before
The news of the demise of a bossom friend I mean
I wish my friend didn't cancel on me last minute_comma_ I was really hoping she could go with me to that special concert.
Thanks for the offer! Yeah_comma_ she just unexpectedly told me that she had a work obligation to attend instead.
That's true. Thanks for reminding me about that.

Looking through my picture albums really makes me relive so many memories.
I know right. It can go either way. One minute your laughing then crying then both.
I once saw a ghost in my living room!
It looked like a cloudy mist.  I was so terrified!
I was told to wait for a call
I waited till i got a call
I feel very good about myself now.

It was least expected though!
Was promoted barely a months of joining my new company

It's just so cool to see how happy children can be in their pure moments.
In the past year_comma_ I was caught cheating on my wife.
No_comma_ I just felt very remorseful about it.
I was feeling really sick earlier today. I thought I was going to die.

Speaking of_comma_ I start a new job tomorrow and I can't sleep. It makes me nervous
Yes_comma_ and I hate it. I wish I could just turn that off sometimes. 
I feel pretty bad about some things I have done.
I drank a bit too much the other night and accidentally destroyed some things.
Last night was terrible! I heard a huge noise and was so scared I almost pooped my pants.
I thought someone was breaking in my house! But it was only my cats being crazy. 
Why won't I get angry at you for not passing your exams
Because I have spent 40000USD so far on your tuition and living expenses
Young man_comma_ don't patronize me. I work for the money not you!

Not just that _comma_but my important documents that's worth a fortune
I feel very good about my relationship with my partner. My partner values my opinion about things.
It makes me feel confident that I can truly confide in them about anything without them judging me.
Thanks. It's nice to have important relationships in your life.
I am feeling very spooked at the moment.
Nothing serious_comma_ but I watched a horror film last night and it was very scary. 
Hey!  The weekend is coming up :D
It is not hump day!  I was just going to tell you I hope you have a great weeked :)  You got any big plans?

t's not unexpected that you are the best
I am not suprised because I paid for top quality education
I witnessed a man eat an entire 3 foot burrito the other day.
It was filled with only refried beans and guacamole.  It was the grossest thing I have seen.
My coworker did an amazing presentation recently. They did a good job.
The presentation was about a new client that we just recently got. It was quite interesting.
Never regretted it one bit _comma_amidst the spate of marital problems these days
Sure_comma_ I call it synchronizing....
It's certainly not something I would want to live through again. I try to fly as little as possible these days
Well yes_comma_ to the whole plane actually. There was trouble with one engine but fortunately we managed to land safely
Yeah_comma_ there was a lot of relief going round I can tell you!
I am so thankful I got a new job making more money.
I start today.. but I am just glad I have a way to help pay the bills .. I was worried I wouldn't find a good job.
My parents have been married for many years. I cannot wait to help them celebrate their anniversary this year!

I am going on a cruise to the Bahamas.  Ive been getting ready all day.
I went camping the other week_comma_ and it was so nice to not worry about everything like I normally do

Life has been kind to me. I am grateful

I feel good and ready for this semester.
Yes_comma_ I planned a lot and got all my things in order.

Hi_comma_ I have a very important exam tomorrow.
For math. I cant help but feel something bad is going to happen
I was so upset when I didn't get to go on this one trip with my friends.
They only had a certain number of slots so I just was the last one to barely not get to.

Hi_comma_ I have no friends at my new job
You'll be alright_comma_ make sure to talk to your coworkers or you'll feel lonely like me!
My boyfriend has really been getting on my nerves!  He never throws anything in the trash and my whole place is a mess.
I have.. it doesn't work.  He is just so lazy!

Oh really? You should definitely consider it! 
I was doing some shopping in a thrift store recently and came across a toy similar to one I had when I was a kid. It really made me remember my childhood.
I thought about it but I'd really have no use for it now.
I caught my wife red handed cheating on me I feel so bad
I couldn't move my body. I fainted because she had introduced the guy to me as her cousin
I was going through some old photos of my childhood.
Yes and I started getting really emotional because of it.

Thank you!  I do.  I am a teacher.  I can't wait!
Last year as a freshman in college I thought I was gonna fail my calculus final so hard.
Yeah I did really well_comma_ though I knew I would do well once I studied a ton.

Wow_comma_ what a great guess! Haha. Thailand_comma_ actually.
I can't face my wife_comma_ I had a child out of my one night stand
I was so stupid_comma_ now I know better 
I am too embarrassed maybe I will talk to my pastor so he can accompany me 
Some guy just married my childhood crush!
I hope so_comma_ I am just so envious of him right now!
One time in freshman year I got invited to this really shady sounding party.
Yeah_comma_ we went to check it out even though we were hesitant and it turned out great though. A lot of fun.
my brother finished high school last year.
it was cool to see us both go off to college.
I was forced into covering for my coworker who was supposed to give a large speech to a packed auditorium. I had no time to prepare for it and really no idea what I was doing. I still had to somehow make my way throught the speech!
I feel all right about it. I tried my best and did somehow make my way through the speech. But I know it really wasn't very polished at all.
I'm feeling pretty good after my performance review at work.
Thank you. Yes_comma_ I am hoping so. I did better than I had expected going into it from the initial response. Here's hoping.
SO I was at the mall the other day and saw my ex
No we made eye contact. For some reason I started getting emotional and went home to cry.
Hi_comma_ my wife took me paragliding yesterday!
At the beach_comma_ I was really scared at first but it was actually exciting!
I felt really bad about what I did when me and my  brother got new phone cases.
Nothing too bad_comma_ just that one was basically scuffed up and almost broken but I took the one that wasn't and that just made me feel bad.
i  can't wait to know if my wife is going to have a boy or a girl child
I want a girl_comma_ girls are closer to fathers than sons ..hahaha

i feel very guilty i would have to confess to them
I had no roommate my first year of freshman year of college which got quite old
it was hard since i didnt have many friends at the time_comma_ got quite lonesome
I walked home through the park last night. There was a homless man there who smelled absoltuely horrible. It seemed like he hadn't cleaned himself off at all in months!
Well he was asleep at the time so I didn't want to disturb him.
Most likely. I like the someone else's problem approach. I'm sure someone knows about his situation.
Hi_comma_ I was cleaning the dishes and lost my wife's wedding ring.
Yes_comma_ and I feel so bad about it. I cant look my wife in the eye anymore
I wanted to spend some time with a friend last weekend but everyone that I tried to get in touch with was busy. That was very upsetting for me.
Maybe I will. I figured they were just all truly busy.
someone cut me off in traffic this morning.
yea i got so frustrated.
I let my friend borrow my car yesterday and I regret it now.
Because he crashed it and totaled it! I am so angry with him
I had to take a licensing test last week for my new job. I spent hours studying for it and felt like nobody could be more prepared.
Well I don't get the results back until Friday. But I feel like I did great!
I have worked all week to prepare for the meeting and feel I will do great!
Its about the investment trends in our company
I had a friend who was getting married last month. Unfortunatley my job forced me to work on his wedding night. Now I don't know if he likes me anymore.
I hope so. He was really annoyed with me at the time.
I got crashed into this morning by another car who was texting while driving which was horrible

yea but still makes me feel bad for doing it.
Seeing that  my wife bought a white color when I  asked her  to buy green disgust me
She promised to go and do that since she realizes how i feel 
I think she still loves me regardless that's why
I recently won a performance award at my job. That made me so happy!
Thank you very much.
I'd been having computer problems for quite a while. Finally I decided to take my computer into a shop. I was shocked at how quickly and fast the tech fixed the computer and had it working like new.
Yeah sometimes they really are. A lot of my past experiences have been negative though.
I was having dinner yesterday and just stopped for a moment to thank the Lord.
I agree_comma_ I just felt so grateful to have food on my table.
I had a friend who was really driving me crazy last night. He was constantly calling me trying to get me to help with a project that he's working on. Unfortunatley I really don't know anything about his project so anything I could do was very limitied.
I wish he was more understanding. But sometimes he seems to miss some obvious facts.
Someone crashed into my parked car yesterday.
hopefully_comma_ i was so mad.
I am scared that I might not have enough money for food next month
Thanks that might be an option.
The latest models of cars are sophisticated
Not yet_comma_though I'm a car enthusiasts
I visitied New York last weekend. The trip there made me remember other trips there that I took with my parents when I was a kid.
Well there's no real secret. We traveled to New York fairly often and it just brought back a flood of good memories.
I feel so bad for having a drunken one night stand.
Because I am married.
I applied for a new job yesterday. It seems like a great fit for me! It pays so much better and is so much more stable than my current job. I think I have a great chance at getting it!
Yes I really am. I would be very upset if it doesn't work out.
My mom stayed with me for a few days last week. She was very helpful around the house taking care of all of my needs.
I think they will. Kids usually never outgrow their parents deep down.
Now I am getting older_comma_ I realise there are things that I miss doing_comma_ like playing tennis or football. Maybe I should start again.
Can you imagine a 60 year old on a skateboard! 
I agree_comma_ i still feel young so why not. Maybe I'll start with a gentle game of tennis!
My stepfather has been in the hospital this week and I haven't called him. I feel kind of ashamed and awkward about it. 
To be honest_comma_ I don't really like him. It hasn't been a very good marriage with my mom. 
Thanks_comma_ I probably will call. I do feel embarrassed because I know it is the right thing to do. 
Hi_comma_ I accidentally had an affair with my wife's coworker. 
No actually_comma_ I can't even look her in the eyes anymore. I feel so bad about it.
I had planned to get my wife flowers for her birthday but I completly forgot. I feel very upset about having forgotten and think she'll hate me.
Well it was a few days ago. I'd still be late.
I had so much belief in people that I gave my car to someone and he drove it and never came back with it
 someone I met at a religious gathering_comma_ so much for trusting!
This is an important time for our family because our son is applying for colleges this year. We're all nervous!
Most likely he will study finance. His grades are good but not the best_comma_ so we just don't know what to expect. 
Thank you! All he can do now is hope for the best!
I am very sure about getting to my kid's school before 1am for the parent teacher's meeting
my car is not in the best of shape and if i take it to the repair shop I wont meet up_comma_ so what I did is I left home very early
My coworker was given a great work assignment this morning. It seems like she did nothing to even deserve it. I wish I could get such great assignments!
I know it's really frustrating. I don't know what I should do at all.
I love by myself and it gets so boring.  Its just me and my dog.
And that should have said LIVE lol.  She does.. but its not the same as having other people to talk to.
I am so happy.. my sister just had a baby!
a Baby girl.. shes so stinking cute!
My friend went to the hospital last week because of a heart attack!
He's recovering. But I'm really nervous about the after effects.
My birthday is next week and its the only thing I can think about. 
i will go out for dinner with my friends. I am really looking forward to it!
My son is getting ready to go off to college and I find myself so happy and sad at the same time. I'm just remembering all the wonderful times we had with him growing up. It went so quickly!
Yes_comma_ I have always known that_comma_ and I know it's a great thing. But it's hard not to feel emotional about it. Life is about to really change.
My best friend just got a new car. Here I am driving the same car for 10 years. 
I know how that is trust me.  Why can she get a new one and not me.. UGH!
I've bought a lottery ticket every week for years. This week shockingly I bought the winning ticket!
Thank you. $50. Of course they take so much out in taxes
Took my daughter to the Animal Kingdom for the first time_comma_ I think I was more excited than she was.
Me too.  But she didn't seem to care.  She loved the Dinosaur ride.  It's a rough one.
I believe she will_comma_ she loves her cats.  
I agreed to watch my neighbor's cat last week while she was on vacation. Unfortunatley I forgot to do that.
The cat didn't make it unfortunatley.
I bought a brand new car the other day. I parked it in front of my house. Then some neighborhood punks came by and keyed it the first day!
It is. Of course fixing it is so expensive. I don't know what to do!
Hi_comma_ the workers at my firm have not been performing their tasks to the required standard.
Yes but it is making me livid that they are not listening to my instructions!
I'm so tired. I was awake for hours last night.
Our dog was baking and I couldn't see what he was all upset about. He never bark like that.
What was stressful for you?
As I opened _comma_it was a friend I had lost contact with for about 20 years 
Who wouldn't? He just showed up like a ghost from the blues.. Lol!
I woke up with a pimple on my face and brother won't stop teasing me about it!
Perhaps so_comma_ but I wish he would just be quiet and stop pestering me.
I am feeling like I have not been the best roommate lately.
I feel like I let my roommate down by breaking some of our house rules_comma_ and I feel bad for it.
I recently got a care package from my sister who lives overseas. She didn't tell me that she was sending it. But it really delighted me.
Thank you. I agree. She really is great most of the time.
My dog died_comma_ I feel so lonely
It been 2 days now :(
I have been attacked last week by robber with a knife. I am still terrible afraid of getting out alone.
No_comma_ the police didn't catch him.
My sister is really sick right now with a fever. I've been taking care of her day and night for the last week.
Not really. I tend to be rather healthy and not get sick even if others around me are sick.
I was so confident and then three people stepped up and I knew we had the title.
They placed in events that they weren't even suppose to qualify in_comma_ to get us more points.
I accidentally yelled at an elderly person becuase I thought they were being mean to me when they were trying to help me while I was driving. 
He was making gestures as I was driving past and I thought he was telling me to slow down. I wasn't going that fast and it distracted me so I got upset. Turns out_comma_ he was trying to tell me of severe weather in the area. 
He was a very nice man in the end and I apologized profusely. 
In the fall_comma_ i had a week off and I didn't make any plans because I was pretty broke. My oldest and best childhood friend flew in from where they live in Europe to spend the week with me- they didn't tell me they were coming. It was wonderful!
The best part was just seeing each other- it has been five years. We didn't really do much_comma_ all our time was spent chatting. 
It really was. I don't know how she managed to keep it a secret!
 "I was shocked when I didnt win the lottery!"
yea and i could whatever i want when i win
Hello_comma_ I brought dishonor on my family by not getting A in my math class
I know_comma_ I am so ashamed of myself. I should have studied harder...
I was so happy last week when it was fridaaay!
to get chocolate wasted!
All of my friends are taking summer vacations. I've stayed home and have nothing to do because nobody I know is around.
I didn't have money or time to plan anything.
I forgot to do anything for my best friend's birthday this year. I've known him for a long time but it just completly slipped my mind this year.
Yeah it wasn't a good thing.
Well nothing really. I guess I'm just losing my memory. He didn't seem upset at me or anything though.
5
5 hundred thousand dollars
But the business did not go well as planned
When I was at my sweet sixteen birthday party_comma_ my crush asked another girl out. I felt terrible. 
Well_comma_ we still had the party. I didn't like another guy. I just felt bad. 
"I was mad when I woke up and it was only Tuesday!"
thats why i was mad!
Yesterday I heard a loud sound coming from my kitchen
No it was a kangaroo. I had to punch him to get rid of him.
Yes_comma_ I did an upper-cut across his jaw. He ran away like a sissy. 
My kids got me started watching the show America's Got Talent. It's really quite amazing how many talented people are out there!
Same here! Have you seen the one guy with the family of adopted boys? What an amazing person_comma_ and a great talent!
My parents decided to send me to a new school out of the area
They thought it was a better school_comma_ and it probably was_comma_ but I didn't feel like it was at the time
I remember after the first day wondering if I would ever have any friends there
I was happy when i woke up and it was friday!
being at home without having to do anything!
And that resulted to an agruement 
I was trying to settle a score him and his girl friend_comma_ then I mentioned her qualities while trying to convince him
I've put in like 10hts of studies daily
Yeah _comma_that's working hard playing less I suppis
I lost my job yesterday.
yes_comma_ i just want to be able to feed my kids.
My appartment was robbed last week. The police called me to tell me that theyprobably found some of the objects that have been robbed. I hope it is true.
Some of the objects have sentimental value for me more than anything else.
Hi_comma_ I have a really essential certificate exam tomorrow.
Yes_comma_ I think so. but I just can't stop thinking that something bad will happen. I am worried!
Yesterday I walked through the park to get some fresh air. I saw a mother beating up her kid in the park. I can't believe that some people really will do that.
No I had no idea what to say at the time. And worried that she might turn on me.
I was mad when it was only tuesday!
cause its not FRIDAYYYYYYY! as oprah would say
I feel very proud to be able to make that importante change at work and I think that my boss will do something for me. Maybe it will be a raise in my salary. 
Yes_comma_ and my collegues and friend are very happy too. They see me as a new leader in the group.
Sure I will do that. But I really enjoy working at that place and I wish to stay there many years. 
I entered a writing contest_comma_ but I didn't final in it. I was disappointed about that.
That's how I feel. Every time one thing doesn't get accepted_comma_ I submit something else. 
I entered a contest to win a free vacation to Puerto Rico last month. Much to my shock I actually won it! I will be taking that trip at the end of this month!
No I'm taking my girlfriend with me. I can't wait!
I was eating one of those ferrero rocher candies once.  A worm was inside it.  It was so gross!!

Haha you got it :D
Hi there_comma_ my lovely wife is leaving town next week. 
She is going on a work trip for 2 months. I am upset at this.
I was shocked to see my dog missing the other day!

In the airplane_comma_ last week_comma_ I was borred by someone knocking repeatedly and aggressively on the toilet door.
Yes_comma_ I was in the toilet. She was wanted to get in.
Hi_comma_ i have made no new friends in my new class

Hi_comma_ I was having dinner yesterday and just stopped for a moment to thank the Lord.
You should do it more often_comma_ I was thankful to have food on the table!
I thought he would not pay back after a long time
Yes I did
He failed to pay back when he promised he would 
There was not a lot of decent paying work in my area
Yes it's a rural area with not a  lot of opportunities
There are some retail jobs_comma_ hotel jobs_comma_ health care_comma_ education_comma_ but not a lot of industry
Its been a fantasy since I was a kid 
To be in Disney land _comma_and see my favorite cartoon characters
There always seems to be bad news on TV these days.
good point! I mean on the internet_comma_ papers etc. There never seems to be good news. It worries me.
Well if we carry on_comma_ the world will not cope with so many people polluting the place.
I went on my first rollercoaster ride about a month ago
Not at first!  It was soooo scary!!
I know right??!!  I'll go again though!
How interesting!  Tell me more!!!
My husband has been home working_comma_ so the house needs to be quiet. The kids are home from summer break. My dad has been nice enough to take them out and keep them busy so we can work. 
He has been so wonderful. They are having fun and I don't feel guilty. 
After months of DIY projects I spent the two days before my wedding getting everything ready. We made all of the bouquets and flower arrangements_comma_ my mother an I made all of the food_comma_ and we got the reception space ready the day before the wedding. It was a lot but I felt really prepared.
Everything went over really well_comma_ except I put the song I walked down the aisle to on a CD and the stereo we had didn't take CD's! Thank goodness for smart phones_comma_ my cousin downloaded the song and had an aux cord so it worked out.
Everyone seemed to have a really good time. I think the best part was the food. It was a winter wedding so we had chicken and biscuits and scalloped potatoes and ham.
I ordered a really nice new car and I am just waiting for it to be delivered. I can't wait!
thanks_comma_ I had to save up for ages
I am jealous of a co worker that got a promotion and not me.
I feel bad
Did you know today is my birthday?
I did not. I came home and was greeted by a large group of people and balloons
I've never had that happen before. How would that make you feel if that happened to you?
 applied for a job recently and put loads of effort into polishing my CV. I really wanted the job because the salary was really good. I felt like the interview went really well but obviously not because I didn't get offered the position.
I think I came across as too confident
He did not meet up to his project dealines
A co-worker is my blood brother. I am is line manager
Yes we did
I have seen her work with children and she does very well.
It's a source of satisfaction_comma_ I must say
Yes_comma_ at least it  makes me think we did something right as parents!
Once when I was in high school_comma_ I unexpectedly received an award. It was for the work I did for the school year book.
I was an editor_comma_ so I designed and wrote up the pages that were in my section.
When the family gets together from different parts of the country
Yeah! That's the period when every one seem less busy
I think I'm a hermit but most times feel sad that I don't have a social life.
I'm not sure how to snap out of it. I at times like my own space but being alone makes me feel depressed.
A fried asked me to make a song intro for an upcoming show
Yeah I've learned it over the years.  It's for an upcoming mma show.  He liked it and is going to use it!
Thank you!  I'm going to the show so I can see how it sounds with the crowd going.
I like to be ready before a long trip.
Yes_comma_ I'm going to Wyoming on vacation.
Yes_comma_ we are all going .
When I woke up this morning I just couldnt believe that work had gave me a large bonus! 
150! It was crazy. I was not expecting it. 
My boss lied to me. Im so upset about it. 
He promised he would fix my paycheck_comma_ he always does after he makes a mistake then he never fixes it. 
I lost my temper the other day with my child when she threw food at me_comma_ and I felt like I was too mean! 
I know_comma_ but still feels bad each time even if you just raise your voice a little and then see their little face all upset. ugh parenthood is hard! 
I let my friend move into my house_comma_ I own 2 properties and figured she could live there for free because she is having a hard time in life. 
I know I have to believe she wont ruin the house_comma_ or her children. 
I found a wallet in the subway. Instead of bringing it to an agent_comma_ I took it with me. I feel bad about it.
Yes_comma_ I can do that but I already spent the money.
My dad used to take us every year on vacation to Virginia Beach. It always made be extremely happy! 
No unfortunately not because he has passed away_comma_ but one of these summers I am going to take my family there on a vacation! Start a new tradition. :) 
Its so hard being alone when you are used to having your family around. 
No with my wife_comma_ and daughter but every year they go to Peru to visit her family for a few weeks and it sucks being by yourself! 
So funny story_comma_ not funny - careless of me_comma_ but still somewhat maybe funny? I forgot to put a diaper on my toddler when she went into the clubhouse pool...................
You can only guess what happened from there_comma_ she dropped it like its hot right in her swimsuit and everyone seen me running with her to go back home ha ha 
I have a toothache today but no time to get to the dentist. 
I took some but they didn't do a thing. Of course_comma_ just what I need!
I finished season 2 of Luther on Netflix last night.
Loved it.  Each episode gives me nightmares.  Great show!
I walked upon a snake in my backyard a couple of days ago.
I killed it with a hoe.
i was shocked when i saw my dog missing the other day
yea he came back later the in the day own his own
I've been hearing some strange sounds around the house at night lately.
I don't know_comma_ but I can't find it.
Every year my brother tries to top me on christmas with gifts and luxury because he has a super good job! It drives me nuts. 
Oh pffft he doesnt do it for me_comma_ for my parents lol. He always tries to out do me every year. 
I wish_comma_ he does get me cool stuff but none the less im still hating on him because my parents minds are always blown! >.< 
 i was crushed when i saw my dog had gotten out
no... hopefully he returns soon!
I was so scared_comma_ but felt so sure of myself to make the long drive across the USA! 
Oh yes it was it took me 6 days_comma_ but it was so much fun and I knew I could do it. 
"I couldnt believe i got a bonus at work!".
$800 and 16 hours comp time!
Something is under my bed and keeps me up at night!
I think I need to! My whole bed starts shaking around and I promise you_comma_ I'm not dreaming!
I woke up extra early just to make sure I made it to work on time for my new job. 
I did yes_comma_ I felt very ready for the first day. You never know about traffic thats right! especially in the city. 
i was upset when I wasnt able to leave work early
yea i had some things in the works
Someone cut me off in traffic the other day_comma_ and they were going pretty fast too.
No fortunately I just had to slam on the breaks_comma_ very annoying though.
I cant wait until after work today I get to go pick up my new car.! 
Its a jeep_comma_ I love jeeps. 2018 compass 
I've not been around too many people lately.
Nothing_comma_ just haven't felt like getting out lately.
The other night I got woke up from a noise I heard outside. I was so scared. 
It was some guys fighting_comma_ but women were screaming and my god it was intense. 
Someone cut me off in traffic the other day.
Well we were just driving on the highway and he cut into my lane with just barely enough room.
I swear traffic is the worst in this city. I was almost in a car accident on the interstate going 80 MPH the other ady with my baby in the car. 
I know for real she was literally right beside me_comma_ didnt even look once and just swerved right into my lane - luckily there was no one beside me because i had to swerve to avoid her hitting me it was intense. 
My friend asked to move into my home that I am selling and live there for free until she can find a place. 
I know shes a pretty close friend_comma_ but its still scary the thought of letting someone move in. They say dont deal with friends or family when it comes to business. 
I blew my budget a little this year and had some financial emergencies so I won't be able to go on a vacation this summer afterall_comma_ it's no fun.
That's a good idea_comma_ I didn't think about that at all! There are a few cheap things around my city I've been meaning to check out_comma_ this is a good excuse for it!
Hi! how are you? I'm getting ready to go on a vacation and am really excited!

I just mesmerized with the kid's performance.
She sung a song. 
I was very impressed to find out that my partner did not receive any tickets or citations within two years of driving
It is impossible for me to maintain such a record. At least one or two i receive a year
My roomate is leaving at the end of the month to move up north
I'll be by myself_comma_ so I need to find another roomate. I'm not really sure about the best way to do that though. I had enough randoms in college
I had picked out some school shoes for my daughter the other day and was waiting for my check to hit the bank so that I could order them.
IT did_comma_ but when I got back to the website both pairs were sold out. I was so upset.
She really wanted them too. Now I have to find something else and school is about to start.

I let my dog out late last night and a skunk was there. I got scared when I spotted her/him trying to scurry away!

I finally got cable in my apartment after 5 years. well_comma_ satellite

It was terrible and expensive.
I haven't had their tacos in years. I don't know why I went lol
I took a huge risk and moved from 1 state to another without a job. I really wanted change in my life. 
I know for real_comma_ it took me 3 years just to do it but I had positive vibes. NY to FL! ( running from the cold! ) 
Do it! Its so worth it. :) 
It impressed me to see Lebron to go the lakers

I live alone now and It is hard sometimes but it's good as well.
As is much of life but it's better to live alone right now and not be abused. I guess I'll take lonely over abuse 
My friend just got engaged to her girlfriend.
Is it? I can't even get a boyfriend!
Now they are all going to be married.
My daughter left for vacation with her friend. 
They went to Coco beach. It is so quiet and boring here without her.

Nah_comma_ but I stayed a listened for a while. I was just super impressed
i was ready for that test yesterday

I was very taken aback when my neighbor told me he still had his dogs. 
He is mentally ill for the past few months..He never seemed to be before and he was VERY close to his dogs and said he needed them..He has been outside all day and NO dogs-
I know right? I have to call AC and hope they care. I am worried he is harming them..Why aren't they ever outside with him? Not even for a second?
I asked my friend to get stuff for a party_comma_ I knew he'd pull through though.
It was a birthday party for someone else.
Sometimes I forget to feed my pets. I feel so bad about that it afterwards
That's a good idea
I cant wait for saturday to get here!

Sometimes I'll forget to feed my dog. I can't help but feel bad about it...
Yeah I feel super guilty
I can't afford to go to the salon.
My friends hair always look better when we go out. I do my own hair.

I am thankful for my neighbors

I am a bit afraid to call AC on my neighbor as I don't want him to retaliate.

I work with children!
I am applying to grad school.

I love my job.  I get to you tell students that they can't take certain classes at the school I work at.

Makes you feel god-like sometimes.
My family and I are going on our first cruise next year!
We are going to Cozumel!

"I was in one of those rent to buy furniture stores the other day and of course I got hounded by a salesman. He was pitching me some unrealistic sounding deal on a kitchen table that I totally didn't believe. It was so hard to get him to leave me alone.
I pretended to get a phone call and then left. They wont walk up to you if your on the phone lol
I brought my lunch to work the other day and put it in the fridge like I always do. Guess what one of my dumb coworkers did.

I took 20 bucks out of my boyfriends wallet. LOL.
I got a wonderful surprise the other day.
My husband picked out a few different shirts and told me to pick one of them and be ready by noon. He took me on the most wonderful date.
He took me to a very nice steakhouse.
In order try to get a friend to break up with her jerk boyfriend_comma_ I sent him fake texts that looked like they were from another woman.
No_comma_ and it made her feel horrible because she thought that she wasn't enough for him.  In the end_comma_ it wasn't worth it.
No_comma_ I just stopped and let the whole thing fade away.
My grandma was very sick and unable to get around very easily. 
No_comma_ so I decided to go stay with her so that I could take care of her until she was better.

Too true. Have you ever been in a similar situation?
my sister won a small loterry and she gifted me 500 bucks
i just used it to trim some trees in my backyard that was long overdue

I got to see my favorite band last night. They were good
Deftones_comma_ they have been around for awhile
I was alone last summer when all of my friends were gone. It just felt like I had no one to hang with
Not at point. 
I had the longest day of work in my life.
Well it's not a bad thing. I was up for 48 hours and i get 2 weeks of paid days off now though.
I came home today and my whole house was clean.. 
My boyfriend really did a lot of chores while I was gone!  I couldn't believe my eyes LOL.
I am proud of my dad. He got to retire earlier than expected
Yeah I was really happy for him
Least year I took my final performance exam for my pilot's license.  I thought it was going to be easy.  I was wrong.
I didn't even make it to the airplane.  The examiner wasn't happy with a few of my answers in the oral exam.  I could have sworn I had studied enough!
My birthday was last week. I had to work and was bummed when it seemed like no one even knew it was my big day.
Well in the afternoon all of a sudden I heard everyone singing Happy Birthday and my manager brought a cake over with candles! I was so surprised and happy!
I just knew I was going to get into a school I wanted to. I was just glad I had a chance

I was cleaning out my attic and stumbled upon my old Star Wars action figures! Going through them really brought back some good memories!

Well one day a stranger knocked on my door. I thought I was dreaming when I saw they had my dog with them. I was so happy they had brought Fido home!
I had to hire a plumber last week for a leak in my kitchen sink. Everything was great until I saw the bill. Talk about sticker shock!
That's what I was thinking.  They already did the work_comma_ so I had to just deal with it.  The price sure blew my mind though.  He must have used gold pipes!
My girlfriend came home with a giant box today. I have no idea what she was planning.
No_comma_ she just did it out of the blue. It was a little kitten! I had no idea she was bringing it home.
I was mislead by a worker who wanted to undermine my work. I had a high estime toward his co worker before this.
He gave wrong data in purpose. This resulted in me presenting wrong results to our IT director.

Yeah he practiced for days and days. He memorized everything which was amazing. I was so proud of him!
I can't believe my 25th anniversary high school reunion is around the corner.
Yes. With all the family graduations this year it has really gotten me all sentimental about mine.
I went to the bowling alley all alone yesterday because my friends ditched me.
Yeah_comma_ none of my friends wanted to go for some reason. I was so sad and alone.
Last week at work I kept hearing people laughing when I walked by. I couldn't figure out what they were laughing at.
Later my supervisor called me in his office and explained I had a giant rip in the seat of my pants. I could have died!
I am getting married tomorrow. So pumped!

It was an important blueprint for software I am designing for a client. My boss would not have been happy if I left it
Someone cut me off in traffic the other day.
I was quite annoyed_comma_ especially because it was unnecessary too.

I couldn't believe that I got a call from an old friend
They just called to catch up.  I hadnt heard from her since she oved to AZ 5 years ago

MY daughter is growing so fast.
I'm mom. She is taller than me now. I wish she was 4 again.

Ugh I can't believe what happened_comma_ he doesn't deserve this.
My buddy got a new smoking hot girlfriend and now I'm lonely
I really am_comma_ you'd think he'd take my feelings in to consideration right?
I promised my friend to pick her up after work but I totally forgot. I just left her at work and now I feel like I let her down immensely.
Yeah I know she was. I texted/called her trying to explain to her I forgot and she completely ignored me.
In the middle of the night I heard some weird noises coming from my basement. I grabbed my flashlight and baseball bat and tip-toed down there.
To my utter shock I saw the biggest rat I ever seen. I swear it was two feet long. I shrieked like a banshee and bolted outside.
I got 2 working arms and legs. I am so thankful for that.
I agree. I am so thankful.
I am feeling a little conflicted and disloyal today. I told my boss I applied for a new job. He was sad.

I used to rush home from school to catsh a soap opera
Passions
It was in the US it had a bunch of young people on it. We would all talk about it at school the next day.
Probably. A lot of the actors have gone on to be in big movies
My daughter lost her last baby tooth today_comma_ she's growing up and it gets me a little choked up.
I know they have to grow up and all but can't they stay littles for a little bit longer?

Some cigarettes. But the interesting part was_comma_ halfway there some one pointed out that my dress was tucked in my undies in the bac. oops

It really hurts to think about it happening_comma_ my house burning.
I was too young to know about that_comma_ we're done for.
I hope so too_comma_ my math teacher has no pity on me either_comma_ had to write my test.
Times sure have changed. When I was a kid no one locked their doors or had to get weapons for self-protection.
I was allowed to roam the streets with my friends all day as long as I was home for supper. Aw_comma_ I miss the good ol' days.
My co-worker got a promotion that I was pushing for her to get. I am so happy for her! She really does deserve it.
She is definitely a hard worker. I am so proud of her.
When I think back to the early 2000's_comma_ it was such a great time for me personally. Everything was perfect.
The great times I had with my friends and family. I had like 0 responsibilities too.
Ever been to a haunted house?
It was so terrifying_comma_ the men with chainsaws chased us!

They wer really nice and trustworthy. I even let them use my wifi password.
They moved away now. I have terrible ones again.
My sister and I got into this huge fight and she called me a fat cow. 
To be funny or what? Because I think it's really rude and unforgiveable. 
I ordered a game off of the internet and it came in on a way later date than expected.
That's what I do now but back then they were not able to be downloaded.
I am a little scared to move to a new neighborhood 
I don't know any one. I am worried we won't fit in. But the rent was affordable and we needed more space.
I hope they are nice. I want to feel cofortable
My daughter is the worst.
She only wants to talk to me when I'm on the phone with someone. Its so rude
OF course I have.
I am mad that the summer is almost over.
I didn't even get to go on vacation.
I had eggs for breakfast this morning. I don't think I cooked the eggs enough and the yolk was raw_comma_ I felt like vomiting.
I could have gotten sick. It was so disgusting..
I can't wait to get to the ocean! It's been a long time coming for me!
No_comma_ I've never done that but my favorite thing is the food! I love the ice cream and french fries down the shore.

Yep. Saved me from quitting a bunch lol
Once I had a really scary experience where I was walking home by myself in a city where I was studying abroad_comma_ and a man started following me and verbally harassing me.
Yeah I called a friend on my phone and talked to her. Thankfully I coincidentally ran into some other students that I knew and they walked with me the rest of the way. 
No thankfully it didn't come to that!
I had a great night the other evening. 
My wife had made a gorgeous spaghetti dinner_comma_ and it was ready the moment I came home.

I cheated on my exam yesterday. It was so tempting because the girl next to me didn't even bother covering her answers.
Haven't gotten the results yet. But I feel so guilty about everything.
I'm perfectly fine with being single at the moment. It gives me a lot of clarity and time to self-reflect.
I've been trying way to hard to satisfy everyone. I think I'm content with being single_comma_ for now.
I wasn't a very good girlfriend to my ex.
I used to pretend to be asleep when he got off work just so he wouldnt talk to me.
He wanted to bore me to death. I told you I was good to him.
I had some car trouble the other day. My car wouldn't start and I didn't know why.
Luckily I had Triple A membership. They came out and jumped my car and said I need a new battery. Glad I was prepared for this!

I had it one a cruise once. Don't waste your money. Its gross
I was just doing what everyone else was doing.
I have never been more appalled in my life_comma_ my husband stole money out of MY bank account and then tried to cover it up!
Jerk is cheating on me and wants to take his side piece on vacation.
I've been reluctant to confront my mother on her stealing my money. I know what she's doing is wrong but she is mother after all.
I've been stuck between a rock and hard place. I've been very apprehensive and don't know what to do.
I'm going shopping tomorrow! yay

Nope_comma_ but I really should. It constantly keeps me from getting anything done_comma_ and if I put him in another room he just meows really loudly
Today_comma_ it is rainning because of that I can't get out. It is boring.
I don't like too much rainy days.
what?
My son and I went to the beach and had a near death experience. We almost drowned as we got sucked in to an under tow
Yes_comma_ it was terrifying indeed!  We were swimming just fine when all of a sudden a big wave sucked us under and spit us out into a deep section. We were seperated and out of breathe.  I surely thought this was the end for both of us. 
So the other day I was behind a guy on a two lane road that was going 10 miles under the speed limit. We approached a light that turned yellow. He floored it and I got stuck at the red light. So mad.
I guess I got that going for me. I wouldn't have hit the red light if he had been going the speed limit though!
Do you watch POWER?
I didn't think it was going to be as good as it is. You should check it out
tell me about it

It is like and infection in the brain.  It came on pretty sudden though.
MY kids are still sleep at noon on a Saturday!
I kept telling them to go to bed last night. I was going to take them out today_comma_ but they didnt listen.

I do feel lucky.. I am sorry that your family isn't as close
This city has become so boring
I think so. I feel like I have done everything and I am so alone
That actually sounds like a good idea. I could meet some new people.
My wife got a promotion yesterday!
I know_comma_ I couldn't be more happy for her. She put a lot of work into her job
I am so nervous about tomorrow.
I am meeting my girlfriends parents.
I want to marry her one day so I want to make a good impression
My son recently graduated from high school.
He is preparing for college.  I am so happy about it!
I was just sitting here going through old photo albums.. looking at family photos.  A bit sad.. but fun..
I kind of miss having photo albums.. the internet sure has changed how we do things.
I look forward to our family reunion every year.
Well this year was terrible. There was a big fight over the food! It was so stupid
My company will give us a bonus because the quarter was good. I am happy.
I am planning to use it for a trip with my family. That will be great.

With all the rain the east coast has had I want to make sure I am ready for any storm that may come my way

They never pay for anything and always look to me when the bill comes.
I passed all of my classes last semester. That's a first.
I know. I am so happy
I hope I do it this semester too!
My son always used to be a really good student.
He is more worried about having a social life it seems. He failed 2 classes last semester.

I know the waiting is making me crazy
I'm leaving for college soon. I have never been so far from home alone.

I picked it up and kept. I feel bad.
I bought beer. I'm a terrible person
I got 2 working arms and legs. I am so thankful for that.
I can't imagine being in a wheelchair or having no arms!
MY kids are a real blessing
4 and 5. They calmed me down because I was a real party animal lol
I kinda miss those days though
A group of students at the university are extorting money from me. I am too afraid to go back to the university.
I am afraid and scared a lot.
I am perfectly satisfied with having no car. Everything I need is within walking distance.
That is great. Less pollution.
I used to only eat microwaveable food.
I know. I have been trying new foods though. I am so glad I did too
That is so true! I am a real foodie now.
I am excited for the new Spider-man movie. It comes out October 5th and it has one of my favorite actors_comma_ Tom Hardy!
He is such a great actor
I'm trying my grandma recip for the fist time today.
It's dressing. I feel like I'm going to fail already/
Well she passed away so that's not gonna happen
I forgot to feed my pets this morning. I feel terrible about it!

Maybe. Maybe not
I am optimistic about the results about my exam test. I think I did well!
Economics. I am hopeful I did well on it because I studied hard!
A really young guy hooked up my cable yesterday.
Haha. No I was just impressed that he did such a good job_comma_ and so quickly. He was pretty cute too

Going on roller coasters makes me so nervous. I can't stand the feeling in my chest on the comedown.
Yes_comma_ I can't stand them!
I lost all my money in my bank account due to fraud. I am so broken...
Yes I'm in the process of getting help. I am truly devastated...

It was a bit hard but I got it organized. I'm pretty proud of myself
I can't wait to start my new job soon_comma_ it's going to be awesome!
Computer Engineer 
I let my daughter go out with her friends today.
I do. But she left her rooma a mess so she won't be going out for a while now.
She is in big trouble now
I went out yesterday with a shirt that had a huge hole in the back. I didn't notice until a stranger pointed it out and I was so humiliated.
I was so embarrassed hahah
All of the classes I wanted to take are full
Yeah but they are boring.
Maybe I can take them in the spring.
I am sure I will do well on my test tomorrow. Wish me luck.
It's a drug test
I think I'm going to get evicted.
Well. I painted and I didn't know it was against the rules. Maybe I can paint it the original color and stay.
I hopep so. I like it here.
I was so excited to see my kids when they came home
They got to go with their grandparents for the weekend
Recently_comma_ i can hear loud noises coming out of my car's engine. It only happens when I accelerate
I am really afraid of this being something of big concern. I do not want to spend that much money for now
I am reluctant to confront my my best friend's girlfriend. I think my best friend is cheating on her...
I don't know what to do but I'm apprehensive. Should I tell her?
I have a secret..
I hate being in the dark. It terrifies me
I can't believe I became on of THOSE people
I can't live without my phone. I know. It's terrible.
I am fine with no more upgrades on anything now. 
I remember the good ol' days of when I didn't have any responsibilities and I was a kid!
I don't know what to do but I'm apprehensive. Should I tell her?
Sorry wrong person. I got so many responsibilities now it's stressing me out!
I left my phone outside all night last night
It was  in the car. But I didn't even lock the doors. It could have gotten stolen
I know right. I always yell at my daughter for leaving hers and look at me
I can't wait for date night
We are going to a fancy restaurant. I bought y husband an apple watch
He is going to love it. 
I am praying that I get the part
In the play at school!
I heard a banging on my window at 3AM last night. I was terrified on what it was but it turned out to be a tree branch.
Lol_comma_ I thought it was someone trying to break into my house. I had my shotgun nearby just in case
I feel like blowing a trumpet I am so happy!
LOLOL.  I got my medical marijuana card in the mail today!
My naeighbors are really getting on my nerves.
They have been playing loud music all day.
They just moved in so I don't know the well. I'm scared lol
5
5
I am so happy that I found all these old pictures
Old friends and good times
I was very sad about someone last night when they chose to ruin all the trust built up over something stupid.
Oh yes_comma_ they have done this a lot. I was just sad they chose to throw the tiny bit of progress away. They just like to ruin everything that's good_comma_ you know? A lot of baggage.
I am a smothering parent. It's terrible
No. I miss my kids when they go with their friends lol
That's probably true lol
I am sooo mad.  I came home and someone burnt a pizza in my oven and left it there.
I know and it was one of those expensive frozen pizzas too... Made my blood boil.
I felt very compassionate towards someone I know with a mental illness and how they need a permanent place for a home.
Not with me as they have not treated me very well and they need therapy etc but they have just had such a hard life and never learned as a child..so I feel bad for them even though they've acted bad. They are staying with my family. I just want them to have a safe home.
I get a break from the kids soon.
No school is starting lol
I recently bought a lotto ticket and won $50!
It was a scratch off. I don't normally buy lotto tickets so it's why I'm so excited! Didn't expect it.
Sooo I just got done packing and I am ready for my trip...
I am going to Australia..  Going to see kangaroos.
I am so excited to go to the park with the kids today
We are going to a really big park that is the kids favorite and we will have a picnic
I was in despair that someone ruined everything over nothing. They continue to ruin their life and everyone's around them.
Not much. If someone wants to destroy themselves and everything that is ever good_comma_ you just hope they stop. All you can do is put boundaries up and try not to let their crap take you down too.
I am_comma_ don't worry! VERY hard when you have loved someone so_comma_ but I am. They are not staying here anymore. So sad when some just don't care.
I was super grossed out when I left some noodles in the sink last night and today there were maggots. I about vomited. Fly summer :/ trying everything!
I have sticky traps and keep things cleaned with bleach and lemon. I need to put lime in the yard and see if that helps. It's like they get in ANY crack everyday! So gross! 
I was so nervous taking my dog to the vet today...
He had an infection in his eye and had to get medicine.  I was just scared because I had a dog go blind before.
I really enjoy sitting outside on a nice cool day_comma_ watching my kids play in the yard.
They love playing on their playground and swinging around their toy swords! Slaying dragons and saving princesses!
I can't wait to get on the road
Yes for the firt time in years
Facebook showed me the old pic from 9 years ago! Hard to believe so much time passed. It made me a bit sad in remembering my cats who have passed. it was a pic of my cat.
No. I just miss her and many of them.
Welp.. I am a little nervous about going back to school this year. 
I am a teacher.. in person.. Starting at a new school.. an alternative school.
I was super sad yesterday when someone I know ruined the little bit of trust I had in them. 
I allowed them back in too rebuild..and they ruined it again. So I really don't know if I'll ever let them back in again.
I was really upset when I heard my best friend lied to me
The worst part is I don’t like to confront her when she lies because the denial is just ridiculous
I am super frustrated that someone I know keeps ruining their life.
Yep! They keep repeating the same bad mistakes to destroy everything_comma_ anytime anything good happens.
I lost my keys at a bar last night. 
Yep.  and it gets worse.   Apparently sometimes people will steal keys_comma_  then come back and steal your car after you leave_comma_ according to the bar tenders.  So I got my truck towed home.  And... no house keys.. 
Yeah_comma_ it was super exciting.... and I wasn't calling my mom (she has an extra key) to come unlock my house at 3am either. so I 'slept' on back porch.
Well_comma_ we're talking here now. 
I am very anxious this weekend as someone I was trying to fix a relationship with is acting up again. 
Well..the only solution is not talking to them however that is hard too. I just get a lot of anxiety about what they will pull next because they usually do pull something.
I am waiting my exams results. I wish I will have good grade.
I am studying IT.
I can't wait to be off work
It is so boring.  At least I am getting paid I guess
A friend of mine spent all night partying instead of staying home to study. He ended up failing an important exam!
I sure hope so! I warned him about going out drinking too often. Maybe this will teach him.
My new foster dog finally run around last night. She has been very abused and starved but is so young. 
Thanks! I didn't know how long it would take her to get better or if she would recover quickly from her abuse. A week in- and loads of progress!
I'm really thinking about switching jobs_comma_ but I'm not sure if I should.
Well_comma_ my current job is really hard on my body since it's really physical. The other job is much easier_comma_ but less pay.
Last night my new dog finally played! She was so starved and abused but she is so young!
Yes! I have some who don't ever get over the abuse (just like people) but this gal-  I didn't think she knew how to play or was just very docile but she took of running with my boxer when he ran and even mouthed him in play!
She is a pitbull mix..low rider- SO docile and sweet..I thought she might be pregnant but no- She sticks right to me leg everywhere. Good with all my pets! She is under a year old :(
I actually love shihtzus and small dogs LOL! But over the past 2 years I have helped many dogs in my neighborhood and all terriers- a few pitbulls. Most are WILD indians so far lol but she is so docile with all other animals. It's nice to have a dog that gets along with everyone including my cats!
We recently got 9 chicks and we've been having to work on making them a coop! I had to do so much research but I think we finally have a place that they'll enjoy living when they aren't able to free range.
We currently have 2 Australorps_comma_ 3 Rhode Island Reds_comma_ 3 Barred Plymouth Rocks_comma_ and 1 Welsummer_comma_ but 4 of the 9 ended up being roosters. Ugh!
I love my little hens_comma_ especially one I've named Curly. The roosters might get replaced by hens though because the crowing is so frustrating!
Well someone I am thinking of working things out with talked about coming over on Sunday. I felt really uncomfortable with that because they haven't done enough to build back enough trust with me yet. 
I always am but I just have to word things in a good way..however lo and behold..they acted up and made the decision for me anyway. 
I  am so glad I get to see my cousins this weekend
We were close but we didn’t get to see each other more than twice a year
I've been going to the gym for the last 3-4 years and haven't missed a single workout.
Oh yeah. Being dedicated and consistent is what will get you the furthest when it comes to fitness! I feel great!
I found a gift card I forgot I had in a drawer!
Its for a restaraunt here in town.  So i've got a couple of free meals 
I felt very happy last night when my new dog was running around playing_comma_ I didn't think she knew how.
I do_comma_ but she was really abused before and was so docile and quiet..some never do learn normal animal behavior..I have rehabilitated many.
hello how has your day been going
ive been feeling better since i just got payed _comma_ been a little bummed
just broke up with my girlfriend recently _comma_ but it was totally my fault 
I am so happy that my daughter is doing so much better in school
That is actually a problem.  This boy has really been harassing her
I have just talked to the counselor recently
I couldn't believe I got flowers at work
My boyfriend sent them
A found a box of my old toys from when I was a kid.
It was cool_comma_ I got to see a bunch of stuff I haven't looked at in decadews.
Most of them.  A few i'm going to toss.   
I am waiting my exams results. I am sure that I passed the exams.
I was well prepared. I am pretty sure that I did well.
I am angry with how my neighbors talk to their dogs.
They yell at them everytime they go outside for the MINUTES they are out there and they get harassed the whole time until they don't want to get off the porch..then they get yelled at more! I rehabilitate dogs from such issues..and this gal is GIVING them complexes!
I am super OVER the people who litter on the outside of my lawn everyday. 
No_comma_ they don't do it when I am out there. I don't know what to do with how upset I get at picking up everyone elses trash.
I miss the time when I was young and I can do a lot of sport.
I am 50 years old. I was a sport addict. I was loving that.
I can't believe how much work my boss is able to do every day without getting tired out or slowing down!
It's amazing to watch! It's one of the few occasions where you can just watch a person and understand WHY they have the position they're in!
I was totally grossed out by a guy who threw his nasty cup of something out the window on the EXPRESSWAY.
Oh_comma_ lol. IT DID! On mine. It hit our windshield and almost made us get in an accident.
I was really hurt when my boyfriend moved away. 
He always wanted to move out of state and I am unable to
I have a neighbor who sits outside all day and it's across from my backyard so I can't sit and relax and watch the birds.
He is crazy/mental illness that is not taken care of and he yells over a lot. Even some nasty things. The police don't care.
I get to babysit for my nephews
Especially my sweet nephews in my opinion
I have knee problems and a coworker don't stop making jokes the way I am walking. He making very angry each time.
There is no HR department. It is a small company.
Today has been uneventful but_comma_ I got a lot of errands done.
These weren't too bad.  I'm all done now though.
My mom lost some of her teeth in a car accident and full coverage car insurance NEVER covers them.
They cover most things but they cut her off from help after a year and had a bad doctor say she was FINE but she has a brain injury.. So SURE- Insurance companies can be very corrupt..However..I got her some fake moldable plastic teeth that will help her feel confident until she can afford teeth. They cost a FORTUNE.
my weeks been going great at work _comma_ how about yourself ?
mine also _comma_ ive hated this job forever since they will never make me a full timer _comma_ and out the blue they offered me assistant manager
Honestly im just gonna take it for the experience and eventually quit_comma_ im still salty it took this long for a promotion
I felt really happy last night when my abused dog started running around and playing!
She was starved and I don't know what else besides being bred and being quite young. So starved she was quite aggressive about food at first and so tired..I could see her hip bones.
I was pretty shaken up from the scary movie
I was an adult this time. I kind of surprised myself
I was expecting some help from a coworker but he didn't keep his word. Before_comma_ I held him in high esteem. Not anymore.
He asked me to help him then he will help in return. I helped him but it was his turn...
I am sad some people I like are such bully's to others. It's a real big turn off. 
Unfortunately life is unfair and I don't see that happen a lot. Just sad when someone you liked is such a mean person. When will people learn you can disagree with someone else without ripping them apart?
My friend fell on hard times_comma_ so I let him borrow my brand new car so he can get to work.
I'm confident he will take good care of it! We have been friends for a long time so I know him well.
The other week it sounded like a bomb went off. I am in a very dangerous city_comma_ so you never know here. Between the gunshots and fireworks..AND fire balls..it's hard to tell!
I try! Having a fenced in yard helps but I worry about stuff at night. It's like vampire city here
yes but that takes money. Saving up!
I wish there will be more opportunities at work to make more money
Definitely working on that.  Good idea!
I am super proud of my little dog. She is sharing her space with a big gal dog who was really abused. 
Typically she doesn't like female dogs but she seems to sense she was abused and needs love right now.
I just got payed yesterday _comma_ so i finally bought new clothes and went out to eat with some friends
Just some khaki shorts _comma_ and running nike shorts since its so hot outside_comma_ nothing huge since all my bills are due next week
when i was little i wanted to grow up _comma_ now that im grown up all my bills leave me broke and bummed lol
I am very irritated with people who want to make everyone else miserable when they are.
WHOA! That's EXACTLY what I say- if you want to be miserable fine..but I don't want to be_comma_ so don't take me down with you! Do it to yourself.
I will never give up on my family
My son is going through a tough time nad _comma_aking really bad decisions unfortunately
I was very apprehensive about someone coming to my house this weekend. 
Because I have been working on trust with this person and it's just at the beginning. I felt very uncomfortable and like I would be stepping back in too old patterns".
 love getting together with my brother and reminiscing about when we were younger
We do but we don’t see each other often enough
I really needed to fart and so I let one out down a grocery isle while shopping thinking I was alone_comma_ but I wasn't!
Someone was right behind me! And I'm pretty sure they heard it_comma_ because they made a funny face.
I was eating at the Mcdonalds when someone who smell very bad sat behind me. The smell was so bad that I was going to throw up.
I couldn't finish my lunch. I throwed everything in the trash and left.
My aunt died.
Pretty crappy at the moment. 
I found 5 packs of gluten free cookies on clearance at my grocery store yesterday.
YES! I am intolerant of gluten and just want to die when I am on it_comma_ so it's always a good day when I can find cheap food that is also good for me! I am easily pleased lol. I love clearance stuff!
Oh there is :( I do eat it now and again but it seems to really screw up my weight loss and digestion so I try never to get near it. They have great gluten free alternatives but yep they are all expensive. 
Organic helps me a lot as well but unfortunately most things that are gluten free are NOT organic and I am so sensitive to pesticides- Trying to find my way around that_comma_ I am also on Keto (low carb-...So my diet is hard some days !lol
I was pretty excited to have a night out with the girls
It has probably been about 8 months are so
I was pretty lonely last night as it was Friday
Oh we all have I am sure :) Thanks. but then the person who is trying to build trust with me acted like a (fill in the blank) and I wasn't so lonely anymore. I remembered why I prefer being alone.
How was your day_comma_ anything special going on tonight or later on ?
Im actually quite pumped for tonight _comma_ gonna bbq and watch the ufc fights
I hope the whole card is awesome_comma_ gonna be some good fights tonight 
I am sometime to afraid to speak in public_comma_ for example_comma_ during meeting at work.
Thanks. I am trying to work on this issue and be able more easily speak in public.
I found $100 in an old pair of pants.
I haven't decided yet. Maybe buy some new sandals. My old pair broke a couple of weeks ago.
It is indeed *puts on sunglasses*
I am hopeful that good things come to those who wait.
 I have messed up a lot with relationships in my life..picking the wrong people so I am happier to wait until it is right and I can trust someone.
I logged in too facebook_comma_ I do not very often and felt a bit sad that I don't talk to anyone anymore.
Yes but I am just not the same peron anymore. I just don't feel like having people around. I had my time of friends and fun and I just prefer to be alone now.
I get out :) I have pets and a mom and I go for walks and run errands. People are hard to trust and I just don't care to be close to most anyone anymore. It takes awhile to build trust.
I am happy to relax on this fine day
It is in the high 70's so it is perfect!  What is it like where you are?
I am ready for my wedding.
Yes_comma_ I have been working on it every day.
I was at the pool the other day with my family. It would have been quite relaxing if there wasn't this little kid shooting water on us and bothering us the whole time.
No_comma_ I couldn't tell who his parents were because the pool was so busy.  We just had to deal with him pestering us for about an hour.
we have been getting in a lot of christmas freight over the last couple of months at my store_comma_ it always brings back a lot of memories of the good old times
i know its not that exciting _comma_ but sometimes i just dwell on the past _comma_ and it brings a smile to my face
I have pain in my stomach for about a week now. By reading what is on the internet_comma_ I am very worried.
I have seen a doctor today. He give me lab tests to do but I am afraid of the results.
I  am so excited to spend each day with the kids during the summer
Yes there is apparently a lot of free family activities locally
My best friend will be going to school in another country for 4 years
She'll be in England.
There was a laptop on sale but by the time I got to the store after work_comma_ it was sold out.
Yea. They're all over $200 more without the sale.
I love that I can see my friend more now".
She moved away for a couple years 
I  admire my mom for leaving her job she has been at for a long time.
She hasn’t been treated well there for a really long time
My pants feel down while at church today.
Yes_comma_ luckily I had my underwear on that day.
Montreal city have done some major renovation to the downtown area. I very happy with the new improvement.
It is look better. They made a new park just in front of my office. I can enjoy walking in the park during lunch time.
Someone found my wallet and returned to the customer service at the supermarket. All my money was still there.
I've only ever lost my wallet this one time_comma_ and I definitely got luckly.
I recently went through some old pictures and it reminded me of childhood.
Nothing in particular. Just how easy it was to be a kid compared to now.
Yes I guess there are pros and cons to every stage of life.
I just got my scores back. Looks like I'm gonna get a 3.8 GPA this semester.
I'm in finance. It's pretty interesting so far.
I am blessed to be able to go to New York City for Christmas.
Yes_comma_ I will be staying right downtown.
Waiting to hear results on the photo I sent in for the contest. I've seen the other entries_comma_ and I think mine has a good chance of winning
2 weeks from now. I wish it was sooner.
Are you a gamer my good sir?
Have you heard of overwatch? I was playing it last night
a lucio saved the point for us and made my 30 minutes not wasted. I was very proud of him.
It really bugs me when telemarketers call my house.
I did once_comma_ keep that scammer on the line for an hour.
I am looking forward to going boating this weekend
We are going to the lake about 15 minutes away from me
Saw an 8 year old boy jump through a flight of stairs on his skateboard.
Little guy was skating like a pro. It was pretty amazing to see him going at it.
I sent in my short fiction for a competition too close to the deadline. I'm not sure if it'll make it on time.
I was too busy trying to get it perfect that I lost track of time.
I wanted to make beef wellington but the gorcery store didn't have english mustard.
I'm going to substitue dijon because its what I've got.
It will be close enough.
I went to the Art History Museum yesterday_comma_ it blew away my expectations.
I usually don't. But this one was very impressive.
Saw this lttle old lady working at a Costco. She was upbeat as ever.
Yea? What are your staples to get from there?
A turtle that came to my friend's yard 2 days ago is now missing.
No idea but it looks pretty fat.
I am going on a roller coaster for the first time tomorrow. I and so nervous!
Haha!  That is a good idea!
I am really worried that I will miss my flight tomorrow.
Yes and there is an expected rain storm.
We are in a tornado watch right now_comma_ so we may or may not get a tornado.
Not yet since it is only a watch and not a warning_comma_ but I have packed a tote if emergency supplies and put it in the basement just in case we end up there.
I had to stay late for work_comma_ and my family went out to dinner without me.
It does. I feel like I barely get to see them nowadays.
I needed gas and didn't have cash. Some stranger paid for it without me even asking.
Some people are quite ok. Makes up for the bad ones I guess.
An old "Friend" that's a girl wants to go get drinks tonight. Not sure if its a trap or not.
trying to shack up with me.
She's a cool chick. Phyiscally_comma_ no.   If she lost a lot of weight I'd probably date her.
I saw a lady walking with her jack russell yesterday. I miss mine
Oh no. I guess we both know what it's like going through losing these loyal creatures_comma_ hu?
I spilled soda on my laptop_comma_ and my friend brought me one from his work to use
It was. He's always had my back.
I was shocked my brother came to my birthday party.
Yes_comma_ I have spoken to him in years before the party.
I am very sad my best friend didn't come to my wedding.
He never gave me a reason_comma_ which makes it worse.
I've been revising this short fic and having everone read it. They all enjoy it. I think it's ready for the writing competition.
Next weekend actually. There are a couple of really good writers entering it_comma_ too.
I really miss the road trips I took as a kid.
I love going to Las Vegas.
My neighbor loaned me their new BMW to use while my car is in the shop.
I sure did and keeping it nice and clean!
I am upset that my brother stole from me.
Cause he was in a bad situation.
I fell out of my chair at work during a meeting.
I'm fine.  My pride is a little  injured though.
definatley. my face was bright red.
My elderly neighbor just recently had to put her dog to sleep. That dog was her best friend and companion.
I came across a really good_comma_ loving 8 year old dog that was abandoned by his family. He was in need of a home_comma_ so I got him and gave him to my neighbor. She was so happy. 
About to get off work_comma_ I think I got a lot done so future me won't have to stress out.
I know. I'm usually a wing it kind of person_comma_ but this was a lot of work.
I know my credit isn't the best_comma_ but I think I have enough of a down payment for this house to get a reasonable loan
Oh I definitely will if the loan interest is ok. If not_comma_ I may have to wait.
I said a very bad joke during a lunch with my coworkers. I felt so stupid.
I hope they have all forgot about it now.
I'm waiting to hear back if I could get earlier flight tickets to my friend's wedding
It will be very close. I won't have to time to relax from the flight before the wedding.
I few years back I was in a really bad car accident. I flipped my truck multiple times in a ditch. It was an extremely scary experience!
Yeah_comma_I came out of it fine_comma_ but my life certainly flashed before my eyes!
This new Korean barbeque place just opened up. Will be nice not to have to drive more than 30 minutes to one anymore.
It's some great stuff! That's why I used to travel for it lol.
I cried the night I found out my best friend died.
This was a few months ago.
I am worried I will drown when I go swimming.
Yes_comma_ but I always see people drowning on the news.
I have some stock that I forgot I had. Turns out they're worth 20k now.
It definitely was! Came at the right time_comma_ since I lost my job.
We just found out my cat has cancer.
Thank you. We will probably have to put her down soon.
My friend loaned me his laptop and I spilled juice on it.

Yes_comma_ but I shouldn't of came in last.
Waiting for my brother at the airport. Haven't seen the dude in years.
Just living his life and working some states away.
My friend's cat had kittens! Can't wait to see them.
They'll probably try to take care of them all.
I'm making venison wellington and I totally forgot to put mustard on the backstrap before I wrapped it.
I'm not sure.. I think its still going to be pretty good.
I'm hopeful. ITs my first time making it.
I just got a new job and they offered to pay off my school debt
Yea. It is_comma_ because I've been so stressed with it.
Just saw a squirrel jump from one neirbor's deck to the other. Pretty amazing
Oh yea. I saw it and was quite amazed. Didn't know they can jump that far.
I was so let down at work the other day. I was expecting to get a large bonus_comma_ but actually received next to nothing!
Nope!  It was a "take i or leave it" situation.  
My friend let his girlfriend go spend the night with her best guy friend
I think it's inappropriate.
I bumped into an old friend from elementary school today.
It was good.  We got to talk about old times.
Yes it was... and we did.   He's married with kids now.
My friend is visting and said she made me something good. I want it to be cake so bad.
I like the melt in your mouth kinds. Doesn't matter what kind.
Going to try out this new restaurant tomorrow. Heard some great reviews.
I'm looking forward to it. All the steaks_comma_ lobsters and sides I can eat.
I have been studying super hard for a new qualification at work. I took the test yesterday know for a fact that I aced it. I don't even need to see the results to know I passed!
Yeah_comma_ I liked going into the test knowing I would pass it!
Came home to absolutely no one. I wonder where they all went.
As long as they're ok. No one left a note or anything.
Bumped into this girl I used to have a crush on in High School.
Pretty well. Turns out she's never dated since and has been busy with grad school.
I'm trying to cook a new dish for the first time. I think its going to turn out well.
Venison wellington... Its like beef wellington with Deer backstrap instead of a fillet.
I've never made it myself but_comma_ I've had it before.  ITs fantastic.
I was looking forward to eating cake when I got home_comma_ but turns out someone ate it.
I was super sad. 
My wife and kid have been out of town for a week. I am so bored being all by myself in this empty house.
Yeah_comma_ it is_comma_ and no guys night for me.  I am trying to save money.  I just miss having them around!
Going to the lake after work. Can't wait to see all the dogs and just relax.
I don't have a dog myself. I just like seeing the dogs there.
Met my friend way back from elementary school. She grew up to be a hottie!
No_comma_ I still thought girls had cooties back then.
My new girlfriend knows how to shoot a bow.
Yes.   I had my bow sitting out because I was practicing for hunting season.  She braught it over the next day and we went and shot them
She's not a hunter but_comma_ she does have a bow.
My grandma sent a lot of food to me through my mom. She's still making sure I get good food to eat.
hahaha they are lovely women_comma_ our mom and grandma_comma_ eh?
There was a time my mom and dad didn't see each other for 4 years because of school.
My mom was going to school in New York and my dad in California. It's amazing they did the whole long distance dating thing.
My mom and grandma were supposed to visit last week but cancelled last minute.
My mom said she had to go to work but I'm not sure I believe her.
Its ok. Im used to it.
I'm babysitting my brother's dog in 2 weeks
I think she's mixed.
Oh man. I just got a ton of Taco Bell. Going to find a movie and chown down.
I haven't picked one yet. I kinda wanna see something that makes you feel.
Going to New York with some friends next weekend. I've never been
We'll be there for 4 days.
The weather outside is great for this time of year.
The high today was 90.  Normally its around 98-100.
Ha_comma_ I grew up here.    100ish is doable as long as you avoid mid day. (12-3pm)
I have recently started gardening_comma_ but am not very good. Thankfully_comma_ my dad came over and helped me out! He saved ma a lot of time and effort!
I agree.  I just don't know anything about it!  That's why I was thankful for the help!  I learn what he know!
I recently lost some weight and now when I dress up I feel more confident.
I definitely have a bit more energy.
Exactly. I never thought I would be successful at it either.
It's definitely been taking forever but it's better than losing it quickly.
I am so mad! My insurance company keeps denying a valid claim and it causes the Doctor to send me a bill! I keep having to call and do their job for them!
Yeah_comma_ it is quite apparent to me that they genuinely do not care.
I inherited my grandfather's rifle.
Yes_comma_ It goes with the rest of the stuff.    It's a rifle he hunted with_comma_ and my father hunted with.  Now I've got it.
I'm so proud of my son who just finished 6th grade.
He finished on the A honor roll. We actually went to Dave and Buster's today.
Yes he really does enjoy. He's always telling me about stuff he's learned.
Yeah he does pretty well. He's a good kid.
I'm almost ready to put my Venison wellington in the oven. I think its going to come out great.".
Its meat (usually beef fillet)   covered in mushroom pate_comma_ covered in proscuitto_comma_ covered in puff pastry.  then you bake it.
I'm an outdoorsman.  I hunt or fish for half of the meat I eat each year.
My dad just bought a new motorcycle for my sister since her old one isn't safe anymore! Why can't I get a free motorcycle?!
Haha!  You have a point.  Maybe I should have said "safer"!
It was idle for too long.
I was excited that my neighbor came to my door
I havent talked to her since she introduced herself when we first moved here
I was able sort out some communication problems that I had with my manager. I can finaly enjoy my job with peaceful mind.
Yes. Now_comma_ I have a nice weekend. Job problems can be heavy impact on my life.
I really enjoy looking after defenseless animals. All of our cats are rescues!
Not too many.  3 cats.  We just like to help them as much as we can and give them a good life.
I am volunteering to be a class mom this year.
Help with the kids. Reading naps and art. Its a kindergarten class.
I know right
My cat threw up a hairball on bed yesterday. I was so peeved!
I know! I was almost too afraid to pick it to throw it away.
I saved up money for four years to buy my motorcycle.
Yes 2 weeks ago_comma_ but I crashed it last week.
I can't wait to visit my aunt
About 3 months but I used to see her everyday before she moved
I miss my childhood friends. We were so close and always playing together.
We grew in Hochelaga_comma_ Montreal. Some of them moved to another city or country.
Tomorrow I have an interview for a new job. Never been so prepared in my life.
I am interviewing for CEO. It's going to be a breeze.
I got to play hours of video games last night after a tough week at work.
It was! I haven't been able to kick up my feet like that in a coon's age.
I can finally say my son is sel sufficient
Oh my that is great work on you
My food order today did not turn out as well as I had hoped.
Everything was cold. We had burgers and fries. You can't eat cold fries.
Nope. I was starving so I ate it lol
Well it was a delivery do we would have had to wait another hour. I did complain though
I bought so many groceries today.
Things for the kids school lunches.
Yes. They are going to love their snacks.
I went hiking all by my lonesome yesterday because my friends blew me off.
Of course! I wouldn't have gotten mauled by a bobcat if they came with me. Bunch of jerks.
I preordered a New Tesla 3 last fall and have still yet to be contacted about when we will get it. Tesla is such a let down for us right now!
Not too bad for a Tesla.  The problem is that they promised a 3-6 month wait_comma_ and it is going on 9 months now!
I am going to a party this weekend
Yes. I already have my outfit together.
I'm going to find me a husband.
My grandma didn't make my oatmeal right yesterday. I was so mad that I poured the chunky_comma_ boiling contents of the bowl all over her wrinkly head. That'll teach her.
I was indeed. But_comma_ I don't think this tragic incident will occur ever again. Sometimes have to show the elderly who's boss.
I am so excited I will be able to take a trip
We are driving to Nashville
I had such a good moment yesterday...my son spoke his first word!
I cried so hard...can you believe that his first word was "sea cucumber"? Couldn't believe it!
My new job is so great.
It's great I work my own hours and the pay is great!
I'm never quitting this job. You should work here.
I have a physics test tomorrow. I think I can say that after 10 days of nonstop studying and copious amounts of adderall_comma_ I am finally ready.
Oh_comma_ it is. I am going to show that test who's boss.
I am all one in the house this weekend.
lol. I'm alone. I don't like it. Its too quiet
That's why Im scared I was kidnapped by a ghost before. No one saw it coming
I took the garbage to the road last night and the bag burst. Got nasty stuff all over my shirt.
No_comma_ my garbage can is 2 miles away. The smell was so strong that a herd of possums jumped me on the way back.
Oh_comma_ but it did. When I was almost there...ALMOST...a gaggle of ravenous hobos shanked me. I'm not sure why_comma_ but it happened_comma_ I swear.
I swore off fast food this month.
I had McDonalds today. I am doing terrible
I am gonna try
My sister and I watch each other's children while we work
It works out well.  Daycare is so expensive and they don't care about your kids more than family
My co-worker won the lottery. 
Well not a huge jackpot but $150_comma_000's pretty damned nice to have.
My son moved out on his own last year. 
He is 20 and is now living with his fiancee and child_comma_ but I can't bring myself to clear out his room. I left it how it was.
My son is finally using the potty.
I had been trying for months but then he just started going on his own. I was amazed
Yoou have no idea lol
I was so grossed out to see my ex
Don’t know what I ever saw in him
Me and my sister were so close growing up.
We hardly ever speak. I miss those days.
I see ger maybe once a month.
That sucks
I am going to be having my baby next week.
It's a girl. I have spent the past several days getting her room ready_comma_ packing for the hospital_comma_ and getting meals made in advance to put in the freezer.
So thankful for good friends
It is.  I hope you have friends that are good
I am taking the drivers test on Monday.
I am. I cannot parallel park.
I am gonna practice after church tomorrow
I'm leaving for college soon
A little of both. IT pretty far fom home.
I hope so.
I had a annoying day at work last week.
Well i am so glad my girlfriend was there when i got home. Made me my favorite dinner and just so glad to have her.
I went to this new restaurant and it wasa amazing
Italian. And the head chef was 19. It was crazy
I know and the food was soooo good.
I miss being a kid.
That's exactly why. I am too stressed now.
Being broke never helps
I embarassed myself in front my class in high school once.
I called my teacher mama/ It was crazy.
They just laughed for so long
I need to buy some clothes for winter. I need a new jacket and boots.
Winter come so quickly. So I need to be well prepared in advance.
A guy cut us off in the car today and almost made us get in a car accident.
No. I don't understand why people can't just try to drive to not kill others. It's not a joke
I let my daughter go shopping for school clothes with her friends today
She bought 3 things. I am so mad at her
She bought three longs sleeve shirts. Its like 100 degrees until november
I bet they were just on snapchat the whole time.
Today I did something terrible.
I ate a whole pizza. It was really good though.
I will try.
I had the best time this weekend!
I turned 40 (not the fun part) and my wife took me on a surprise trip with our 5 best couple friends.  So fun!!!
I am going to ace all of my classes this semester.
I didn't overload myself like last time so I know I will.
Exactly. I think I found a great balance
I am going to try my best.
I felt a little bad I accidentally bought 5 packages of clearance cookies. I thought they were gluten free but I got the wrong kind.
No_comma_ I am allergic to gluten. They were from a kind that I thought only carried gluten free stuff I was in a rush. I hate losing $10.
They are cookie dough so they wouldn't keep. Yes I could donate them
My ex and I broke up but it was nice and clean.
We are now. I hope it lasts.
Thanks.
My refrigerator broke today.
I did. I had just went grocery shopping. We were gone all day and it was 100 degrees today.
I will try to find one tomorrow. 
My wife is pregnant with our first child. I can't wait to see this baby for the first time!
Thank you!  I don't know yet if it will be a boy or a girl_comma_ but I really don't care either way_comma_ I'm just excited.
"I am thrilled! I just found out that I'm pregnant! Its my second child and I've been having trouble getting pregnant again. It was such a surprise!".
Do you have children?  Have you had trouble getting pregnant before?
Oh no_comma_ I'm so sorry.  I have had a similar experience with my second child that I lost.  Don't give up!  I'm glad you're seeking justice.  I'm very wary of doctors myself.
HUGS! I saw a mom and baby bunny around 8 and they were letting me talk to them. It was a bit shocking as usually bunnies take off whenever they see or hear anything. 
Wow strange! I normally just see glimpses_comma_ I have two bunnies of my own but it was so sweet to see two just sitting and listening to me. The baby omg..so cute
Monkey Girl and Mousey :) One is a lionhead..I adore her and the other is a lop eared big old bunny_comma_ scared of everything..including Miss Monkey Girl.
My lionhead looks like a shihtzu puppy_comma_ I just adore her- she is SASSY! Don't get a lionhead unless you want a sassy rabbit lol. That is sweet! Bunnies are fun pets for sure! You are the sweetest! I wish you much success in life
I can't wait to have grandkids. IS that weird?
I know right. I miss having a little baby
BAby smell is awesome
I was surprised when I saw two bunnies..a mom I assume and her baby_comma_ running around tonight.
It was! Rare that wild bunnies don't just take off!
Im not sure my boyfriend is the one
I think so too. He is so sweet too.
That's great advice. Thanks
MY kids are gone for the weekend. My house has never been so quiet
Its bad. I miss then
Tomorrow. I'm so attached to my kids. Its bad lol
That's so true
I am super aggravated at people that just can't let things be peaceful. Even if you disagree.
I know right? Why can't you just be nice and keep it calm and peaceful. No one wants any drama. Don't be a jerk is my motto- If you can't say nothing nice then keep it to yourself or keep it peaceful.
my daughter left our freezer open for hours today.
We only had popsicles in there. But I wanted those popsicles lol
I know
My kids are out of town on vacation with my parents for the next week.
Actually it's way too quiet and boring.
I had to go to the DMV today to renew my license. It took 4 hours and I ended up having to use a sick day...Not happy!
You know it!  They should have to pay me for the work I missed!
I miss my ex
we broke up a long time ago but we used to be friends before.
IT was bad_comma_ I have no idea what he is doing now
I am super sad that people I've known and cared for do not want to change their destructive behaviors. I
Yes... It's very sad especially when you know someone was abused for so long and they just keep ruining their lives. Almost like they are continuing the abuse on themselves.
My co-worker ripped a nasty ole fart in her cubicle the other day. Which just so happened to be next to mine.
You're  telling me! It was absolutely revolting. I am never going to let her live that down.
I broke my phone today.
I got in a heated conversation and threw it lol
I feel so dumb lol
I got out of the slammer last month after being there for 50 years. Hoping the remainder of my life is spent on a beach like at the end of Shawshank Redemption.
I was five years old. Went in for burgling a candy store.
"Last week_comma_ my husband surprised me with a trip to Charleston_comma_ South Carolina next month. I am so excited! We haven't had a vacation in years so I can't even believe it!"
Eat at as many restaurants as I can_comma_ go to Folley Beach_comma_ explore plantations_comma_ and take a carriage ride to name a few. I have been researching a lot. 
I applied for a new job last week.
Not yet_comma_ but I am really wanting to get this one and I kind of think I will.
I lost another wallet today
I have lost every single one I have ever had.
I have no earthly idea.
I am happy I am not being abused today.
Thank you! i appreciate it.  I am happy I have a chance to live my life still and make something of it. WITHOUT abuse anymore.
<3 Hugs!
I always have to save up to buy myself something nice.
I envy people who can just spend so freely
I should but I work and go to school. I don't know if I can right now
psychology. its boring lol
My friends wouldn't go with me to the gym last night. I was so mad that I shattered my phone.
I do. I think I took too many steroids that morning. Usually I eat a bowl of 30 or 40_comma_ but I was feeling froggy and tried 100. Mistakes were made.
I was married to my wife for thirty years_comma_ and even though she has passed I can't bring myself to date anyone else.
I don't_comma_ but my kids keep telling me to try it out.  I just feel like it's cheating and I can't stand the thought of it.
MY daughter stayed home while I ran errands today
Surprisingly she had cleaned the house. 
She asked for an expensive pair of shoes as soon as I walked in the door lol
I took my grandma to the ER yesterday because she broke a nail.
She did indeed! She thanked me for saving her life afterwards.
I miss old times when my grandma was with us.
Yes_comma_ I lost her about 10 years. She was so kind and a good listener.
I love that I have friendly neighbors that like to sit outside and have a bee on the weekends
It is good to have people around that have your back
"I just found out that I'm pregnant. Its exciting but also scary because I lost my last baby at 18 weeks along. I'm just really trying to have faith that it'll turn out well."
Yes_comma_ they told me that I would see a specialist along with my regular OBGYN and they seem to be staying on top of things.  I am now also eating a plant based diet and feeling much better than my other pregnancy.  
My ex flaked on me again today.
He sucks. He was supposed to pick up our son today. I'm glad he is too young to know what happened.
I agree lol
When I was a wee lad_comma_ I was always afraid of going to sleep. Always thought there was a big ole scary monster lurking in the closet.
I know_comma_ right!?! I swear I saw bigfoot a couple of times_comma_ but my parents never believed me. Now he is out roaming around the Pacific Northwest somewhere.
I was robbed at gunpoint once when i worked as a cashier.
Yes he did and I had to testify against him. It was very scary. 
I love that my kids have started helping out around the house now
They are 13 and 10.  Thank you!
My big soccer game is tomorrow. I am so excited that I can't even sleep
I play waterboy. Can't wait to provide delicious and nutritious water to all of those parched_comma_ puckered throats!
I didn't ask the girl I like to the Prom and I really wish I had just gone for it.
Well_comma_ I felt inadequate because it was summer school prom and she didn't have to go to summer school.  I thought it would make me look stupid.
I got a random bonus in my last paycheck I received this week.
It was because I got the employee of the month award! I knew flipping 1000 burgers would eventually provide dividends.
I am happy to snuggle in my boyfriends arms and watch tv all day tomorrow
We will probably binge watch the office
My daughter and I found a sweet little bird that was hurt yesterday_comma_ sitting outside our door. We are trying to give it water and help it heal. Its so pitiful and helpless.
It seems better.  We have it in a shoe box and its drinking water.  It seems to be its leg that hurts which is good and at least its wing isn't broken.  We are trying to think of a name but I don't want my daughter to get too attached.
I planned for a great vacation_comma_ then someone at work got sick so I couldn't go.
Luckily I was driving_comma_ and was able to cancel my hotel reservations. 
I was happy to find that at work my coworker prepared a birthday party for me. I was not expecting it.
Yes. The most that we could garther together.
I took out the trash last night and had the displeasure of seeing a herd of cockroaches at the bottom of the bin.
Oh_comma_ it was. I afraid for my well being.
I couldn't believe my friend started working with me
I work from home now for a an online retail company.
I was so mad last week when I got a flat. It was in traffic too
I did after a few hours
My daughter said her first word yesterday. I was so proud!
It did! She said "daddy". Chills went down my spine.
I could not wait to go to the amusement park. I had no been in awhile.

I was. They work very hard to make their goals. 
I am lucky to have a roof over my head
So many people do without

My Mother was ill. I was very worried about her condition.
She is better now_comma_ but when she was sick I never left her side and made sure she was well taken care of. 
I went to close a bank account today_comma_ and when they got there they said it was overdrawn by an IRS tax lien. I have never been so angry in my life!
Yeah_comma_ About $4000.  And I still owe them $100_comma_000.  It's alright I'll just set up a Go Fund Me for my bad decisions.
My son goes to kindergarten in a week and I can't imagine him being gone through the day. It's hard to not be worried about how he'll be at school.
I hope so.  He's usually right there and I usually teach him.  I was thinking of homeschooling but I work also.  He is going to a wonderful school.  I do wonder if I'll have extra time on my hands.
Friends threw me a surprise party at work yesterday. It was quite the surprise!
I did! I got so many cool gifts.
I was happy to see my aunt at Christmas. I had not seen her in a long time
We are very close
I was scared when i had t go home alone the other day
its a dark wooded area i live in
The cashier at the grocery store gave me back the wrong amount of change. i didn't notice until I was at home.
I called the store and spoke with the manager. 
I have my driver's license test tomorrow. Been practicing all week for it.
Nope! I've been practicing so much that I am sure to crush it.
I was very happy to have the whole family at my house for Easter
yes_comma_ we did.
We had them all collect the same amount so it was fair for the littler ones
I was very envious when my brother got this cd before I did. It was from my favorite band
Yeah_comma_ I got it eventually
I was waiting in a long line to take the bus. Two young women cut the line and go directly in front everybody.
I spoke up and was very angry.
I was afraid when i went home alone the other day

I am sure I will get this house clean tomorrow
Thank you.  I don't know why I never complete the job I start
My dad left for his deployment to Afghanistan yesterday. It was a sad time.
I am sure too. Just still so worried about him. 
4
I am sorry. I meant to say I cared for my dad one time. I just felt like I had to make sure he felt better
I just had to bury my Golden retriever today. I had him for 10 years.
I'm fine_comma_ I went out and got a new one this evening.
I haven't been feeling well and my husband has been so great. He takes care of the kids_comma_ goes grocery shopping_comma_ and makes sure I'm resting. 
Sometimes.  Unfortunately not as often as I would hope but you can't have everything.  He's still a good man.  I don't blame him since he has cognitive problems.  I love him anyway!
I am a little nervous about dating
It has been a really long time and I am not happy with the way I look anymore
its impressive when a team can snag away a start player from another team
lebron to the lakers
I ate 50 Big Macs yesterday. Felt slightly bad for the herd of homeless across the street_comma_ gazing enviously upon my pile of gluttony. 
I have quite a large stomach. Only the biggest meals will sate my absurd appetite.
My sister graduated from high school and my parents bought her a car. I didnt get a car when I graduated.
Very envious. But she is the youngest so she always got her way. 
I was scared going home alone!
cause its a dark wooded area
I felt a little let down when I had to leave work
I had to leave because my kid got suspended
I lost my medicine today_comma_ one that helps me focus my attention span. I needed it especially because I had a job interview that I wanted to be sharp for. I felt weird during the interview_comma_ and now I don't know how I did..
Yeah_comma_ it does. Thanks. And I'm not sure! You can never tell with those things. They take their sweet time contacting you back while you agonize. Sometimes they forget to even send you a reply at all! But maybe I'm overreacting.
I threw up all over the bus yesterday.
I think it was the rotten eggs that I ate for breakfast. The experience was mortifying to say the least.
My sister just bought a new house_comma_ and she is only 25.
She has been working and saving money since she was 15. Very determined young lady. 
wishing that he would call me
I did and he hasn't returned my call
My neighbor returned my golf clubs yesterday after I thought I lost them at the golf course.
He didn't! He promptly returned them to me once he found them. I was so thankful.
I am jealous of my brother because he is better than me in sport.

I start a new job as a nurse next Monday and I'm so nervous. Nothing can prepare you for the real world of nursing compared to nursing school.
I'm looking forward to it also though since I get to work in the NICU and take care of little babies.  That will be so rewarding.  I will always take it very seriously since their lives are in our hands.
it was nice taking care of my sisters dog the other day
a husky .. charlie
I kept playing a card game with my brothers_comma_ and I kept losing. They were bragging over and over_comma_ and being disrespectful. I just wanted to spend quality time with them... It gets frustrating sometimes.
I have one that's four years old than me_comma_ and one that's eight years older than me. They do like to gang up on me_comma_ especially since it's easier just because I'm a lot less further along in life than they are because of age. They really can be tough. But I feel like it's important to stay close to family.
I'm a brother to them. And thank you for the compliment! I'll just try to stay positive.
I can’t wait to go on a blind date".
I still havent met him. My friend is having us meet
I saw a fat ole rat slinking around my garage when I was taking the garbage out.
I'm thinking about hiring an exterminator. I can't gave vermin like that running amok around my house.
I went to my school reunion alone _comma_ my husband couldnt make it. I saw a lot of old boyfriends there.
Kind of fun_comma_ But I let them know I am married and very much love my husband. 
I am in a long disance relationship
I am not interested in anyone else and I am busy with my kids but I miss him
I've been studying for my math test all this week. Never felt so prepared in my life.
It is Algebra I. Pretty tough stuff.
I found my old teddy bear in a box from a storage unit today. It really brought back some memories.
It was the last thing my mom gave me before she passed away_comma_ so it wasn't really good memories.
i was schocked when i had to go home early
my got out from the backyard
I knew a coworker wanted a project at work but I volunteered for it anyway.
A little_comma_ I felt bad but we are all trying to get ahead right?
I'm kind of ticked off because my friend that I work with got promoted to manager. I really feel like I should've gotten the job and I know she knows that!
I feel like it already has because I'm trying to get over being mad at her and get over not getting the job.  Plus she's now considered my boss so I have to be professional and listen to her.  I hope its not weird.
I have my soccer game tomorrow and I am so pumped that I can't sleep.
I am the waterboy! Can't wait to provide sweet_comma_ succulent water to all the parched_comma_ puckered throats.
I am feeling uneasy about going to court
I am getting a divorce finally
I took the bus without paying for it. I feel bad afterward.
I will see how I can repair what I did.
I was totaly destroyed when I found that my wife took all the money that was in the bank account and left me.
No yet. She took what I have been saving for 10 years.
When my son was in elementary school he hated getting up and going to school. He used to throw a fit in the car in front of the school.
He has gotten better at time. I used to think people thought I was beating him and I would get in trouble. His fits were really bad. He liked to scream a lot.
When i was a kid i was alone at night during a huge thunderstorm and the wind was whipping outside.
I stayed up all night terrified since i was like 5.
I was saddenned to see Lebron Go
me either
I am worried about my interview
I am applying for an internal position at work
I got a break from work_comma_ so I went to the park to read my favorite book.
It was. I felt so relaxed and one with nature.
My sister and I went through some old pictures
It sure did.  She had a lot of pics I didn’t know of
I was in a car wreck on the way home from church.
Yes. I was wearing my seat belt. My car cant say the same. 
I changed my baby's diaper for the first time ever today.
It was pretty darn gross. Thought I was going to vomit.
last week i felt all alone when the family left
they went to visit other family.. had the day alone
My turtle ran away from me today.
Yeah_comma_ he was all butthurt because I wouldn't let him eat an extra tomato. Serves him right_comma_ but I do marginally miss him.
About to open a restaurant with my friend. I hope it goes well.
Probably the sushi and steak special.
i felt sad when I was all alone the other day
family left without me to visit some other relatives
I was just released from the hospital yesterday.
I am feeling pretty good. Looking forward to my bright_comma_ healthy future.
I broke up with my boyfriend a month ago. It was hard but he just wasn't right for me. The biggest problem I have now is that I feel so isolated and lonely without him.
Yeah_comma_ I definitely don't want to get back together just because I miss having someone but its definitely hard.  I'm struggling to find things to do or get out with friends.
My girlfriend is finally coming back to the states after being away for 4 years.
She got a scholarship to go to school abroad.
My dog pooped on the carpet yesterday.
Nope. I am far too lazy to do that. In response_comma_ I beat her with a pool noodle. Think that got the message across.
This bird chased my cat on our walk
Nah. He's a pussy.
Have you seen the show sharp objects?
I like it. Its kind of scary to me though. I don't think its supposed to be scary
You should. With the lights on
Then you are nothing like me lol
My sister who was my best friend passed away. 
thank you. Now I dont have anyone really to talk to or do things with. 
I am worried about not being ready for the party on Friday
I don't know if I have enough energy to get the house deep cleaned and prepare all the food
I was watching my cousin_comma_ who is only 13-years-old_comma_ being a pretty good motherly figure towards my 7-year-old nephew while were hanging out today. It's interesting to see how well she performs at a young age when dealing with kids_comma_ and how patient she stays when most adults wouldn't be able to
It really is. I was caught off guard by the compassion and ability to take all the frenetic activity going on around her in stride and stay calm and talk to the children respectfully_comma_ trying to teach them instead of just yelling at them. I don't know if I'll be that good when I'm a parent.
It took me 3 hours to mow the lawn. I'm glad it's done.
My lawn is normal sized. It's just that my mower kept stopping and going.
I was all alone last week when my dog got out
no still missing after 8 days
I went to the bowling alley all alone yesterday.
I didn't. My friends ditched me. It felt pretty bad.
We had a group project_comma_ and everyone was delegated their parts
Yep. They did. It's kinda nerve wrecking hoping everyone does their part though.
I was real scared when a tornado watch was issued. It just worried me
Yeah_comma_ nothing got close to us.
Passed by my old classroom. Looking in_comma_ it made me miss the time I suffered in the back through lecture
Yea_comma_ it can be_comma_ but classmates are kinda make it worth it sometimes.
I have been trying to save money for a big vacation next summer.
I hope I can save enough... I want to go to Egypt and see the pyramids
I was shocked when i wasnt approved for time off the other day
too much work.. no one able to take off 
I went to the skating rink all by myself yesterday. 
It was kinda a bad time. All my friends ditched me.
I felt bad when I ate sugar the other day. I am on keto and it's a pain to cook the sweet treats I can have.
It helps me lose weight and I have energy on it. I just don't do well on carbs but eating sugar can reset me :/ It just takes such a long time and money to get ingredients and get a dessert right for keto.
The desserts are expensive but actually it's quite cheap if you do fasting. I eat much less now. It is not hard most of the time but you do get sick if you eat too many carbs- So that makes it easier to stick too lol
I knew I was going to do well on my history finals. I studied hard
I am too_comma_ it was a fun class
There was supposed to be a party this weekend_comma_ but it got cancelled.
Yep. You're definitely right!
At dinner with my friends_comma_ I choked on water and coughed it up all over the food
That's ok! I just felt so bad for my friends.
"I have a hard time eating_comma_ I am allergic to so much! It gives me a lot of mixed feelings when thinking of eating.
I am not sure! lol- I seem to be allergic to pesticides so any unorganic food_comma_ artificial flavors_comma_ colors_comma_ dairy_comma_ meat_comma_ gluten_comma_ sugar :/ I just never know how I will feel after I eat and what the issue is so it's hard! I need to get an allergy test done soon. I eat so plain..and even that seems to hurt me.
Nothing scares me more than a snake.
I live in FL so I see them often and I get totally freaked out.
I was very calm this last vacation. It was just very relaxing
We went to asheville
My friend has been struggling through treatments for colon cancer. I am trying to be as supportive and helpful as I can. I try to go to every chemotherapy treatment she gets since her family isn't nearby.
How did you encourage them?  I try to be compassionate and uplifting but finding the right combination is tough.
They ran out of my favorite dessert at the restaurant I went to.
I just went with fruits. 
It was impressive when lebron left the cavs for the lakers
because he already left once before and it is where he was from
My friend is having his first baby!
Not yet. He's such a chill dude. I think that kid is going to come out holding a game controller.
I am so happy.  I got an A in my online class.
Thank you!  It was pretty easy but I am still proud of myself
College is starting in 3 weeks_comma_ and I have my apartment all settled_comma_ my classes picked out_comma_ and my student loans scheduled. I feel like I'm on track to start the semester in a way where I'm not hurried or confused_comma_ and it feels good.
I'm attending the University of South Carolina as a social work major. I'll be a senior_comma_ so I'm kind of excited about that. But I will have to attend graduate school after this_comma_ so I can't get that "Almost all over with!" feeling just yet. What about you? Did you ever attend college_comma_ or want to?
Hey... that's okay. I'm 28 and just now about to finish my 4-year degree. My brother finished his at 36. There's always a reason for the path you take. Maybe it led to better things. Don't ever just consider yourself a statistic. Good luck!
I picked up my son from daycare today and they said another kid had pushed him over and taken his toy.
I didn't do that.  I yelled at the teacher until I got tired_comma_ then I left.  I don't think I'll send my son back there.
I was so mad when I failed my science test. I knew I should have done better
I know_comma_ at least I learned from it
When I got home tonight my outdoor window was broken- To my cat room.
The cats are fine as there is a screen_comma_ but I am in a bad neighborhood so I don't know what happened and who did it? A bit frightening.
MY sister just went back to school at 30 years old.
I know. She has three kids_comma_ single mom_comma_ works and goes to school She is awesome!
I think she might be
Clown movies scare me.
I don't know why. I'm not afarid of them in real life though_comma_ but the movies are super creepy!
I'm not very close with my family.
I wish I was but its never good when we get together. 
Mean and dishonest. Its very toxic.
You're so right
I came home and my outside window to my cat room was broken. 
A room for my cats! It makes me feel scared as I am in a bad neighborhood and would like to know what happened when I wasn't home?
No. They had a screen in front of it- the window opens out- It's old- but I don't understand who broke it? And who was in my yard? 
I've had family visiting for the past couple of days_comma_ some cousins and an uncle and aunt that I haven't seen a long time. It's always great to be reunited with family_comma_ especially after you get over that first initial weird social hump of feeling each other out after not having spoken for a long time. It's crazy to see how much the younger cousins have physically changed! Anyway_comma_ it's been a blast playing games and catching up with them.
Thanks! Yeah_comma_ it's hard having so many people in the house at one time_comma_ since it's so much frenetic activity. But it's worth it for a few days_comma_ to make sure you stay in touch with family. Do you have big family visits?
I was hapy when i got to leave work early!
took the kids out to peter piper pizza!
Well I bought a bunch of scratch offs today.  I really wanna win the lottery.
Not yet... I haven't scratched em yet.  I really could use the money I hope I win!
I'm planning a birthday party for my mom and she lives in another state. So I'm using a caterer that lives near her and banking on them doing a good job.
Yes_comma_ I'm really excited about that and we're having family from all over coming in.  Its her 60th.  Its just weird having someone make food for it that I can't taste beforehand.  They get good reviews though.
My laptop broke_comma_ and I lost all the information on it.
No way at all. I've got to start from scratch.
I hear happy when I hear this song on the radio. It makes me think of my dad when I was younger
No_comma_ he passed away
There was hair in my soup_comma_ and the owner wouldn't take responsibility.
It was a nearby pho place. I'm not going there again.
I didn't have a vacuum for a day and my vacuum hasn't been working for awhile anyhow_comma_ so my floor was pretty dirty.
yes I already got a new vacuum tonight and WOW_comma_ nice to finally have a clean floor! It shows how bad mine was at picking anything up.
That sucks_comma_ no pun intended. Can you return it?
i loved watching my sisters dog the other day
boxer
I was at the beach one time walking by the pier and I saw a diaper floating in the water.
Nope.  It was horrifying.  It changed everything for me.
Going camping next weekend. I haven't hung out with my friends in so long.
To a city named Scotland. Their pier is supposed to be very beautiful.
I have started to makes schedules for myself everyday
I am. I never forget anything now. I keep bust too
Especially as you get older lol
My favorite store is going through some tough times. They're trying to find another distributor so they don't have to raise prices and lose their customers.
It's a Asian store that carries ingredients I can't find anywhere else unless I order online.
I just got cable installed
Yes but Im upset about it
I have 600 channels and there is still nothing to watch that I like!
That makes sense. I'm not paying for this lol
I had a big piece of cheesecake yesterday. 
Me too! But I didn't need sugar a second day in a row_comma_ it kicks me out of my ketosis_comma_ so I felt bad!
Plain! I should really make it at home with xylitol...but I can't seem to get the thickness and I love the NY cheesecake type
I cant wait till tomorrow I am going to the mall.
All of em LOL.. I have been saving up for weeks!  I need back to school clothes
I was so scared when a tornado hist close to me. I thought I was going to die
I am too_comma_ it was something though
i loved it when i watched my sisters dog
yes_comma_ and he lived!
A girl was actually hitting on me.
I stuttered and excused myself.
I watched my daughter be born this morning. It was one of the best days of my life!
It was.  I didn't realize I would love a kid so much!
I was very shocked that they had a bunch of deli turkey on clearance with so many people shopping today! 
It is the BEST_comma_ especially when you are poor! lol- It means you can eat more or eat for a longer time. I love to stock up_comma_ I live for clearances like that!
I just knew my favorite soccer team was going to do well. I had a good feeling
I am too_comma_ it was a great game
I got an extra 2 days paid time off from work.
Yep. I'll enjoy it greatly!
I was sad when my brother didnt show up to my birthday. I really wanted him there
He had to work
Someone broke a window in my side yard today. I don't know when_comma_ I assume I was gone as my dogs wouldv'e went nuts.
We are so far but  I live in a bad neighborhood and it's late so I am still up a bit scared about it.
My sister got invited on an all expense paid beach trip by one of our mutual friends. I can't believe she's getting to go and I haven't had a vacation in 3 years.
Its hard not to be when I thought I was a bit closer to her than my sister was. Its a 10 day trip beach front and now I have to hear about it too.
I found a Christmas ornament my daughter made for me when she was younger
She is 13. She was 3 when she made it. Its a clay stockin that they got to paint themselves
ONe day they will be married and have their own daughter. 
I was confident about my final test. I had studied all week hard
It was history_comma_ my favorite
I was supposed to be going on vacation_comma_ but one of my coworkers quit suddenly.
I'm not upset with him though. Work hasn't been treating him right.
I keep everything my kids make
I don't/ Thats the problem lol
I know right lol
I looked at a recipe that I wanted for dinner tonight_comma_ and I actually had everything I needed to make it.
It never happens to me.  I end up having to go to the store every day at least once.  I feel like I earned a vacation day.
I happy to see my brother last weekend. It had been a long time
He had just been busy with life and work
Tomorrow is movie night!
SING for the 100th time. My kids love that movie
Last day of summer vacation I can watch it once more
I have never been on a cruise before_comma_ but I am going on one next month with my best friend.
We have so many activities planned; scuba diving_comma_ parasailing_comma_ and relaxing! I have been saving up for this for so long. I cannot wait!
the best friend I have had for he last 10 years will always be my best friend
It is. We have been through a lot
I was a little lonesome last weekend. I was sick and my friends were busy
No one_comma_ just my cat ha
I am so luck that I had healthy children.
Some parents are less fortunate. It sucks.
I was shocked when my aunt came to my graduation_comma_ She lived far away
I was very happy for sure
My daughter didnt have a good first year at her new school.
She didnt make a lot of friends. She is shy
Thats what I told her. This year is going to be better
13 is a tough age for girls
The birds in my neighborhood all gather on my fence if I haven't feed them that day.
All kinds_comma_ Wrens_comma_ sparrows_comma_ blue  jays_comma_ wood peckers.  I feel very protective and cannot help but take care of them. I will feel sad when I move. I like feeding all critters
I was nervous when starting a new school. I knew no one
Yeah it was very tough
I am very upset and a bit disgusted by that the person I live with still doesn't like paying bills. You have to pay bills to have things
Not a roomate lol-but yes. That's how life works though. If you want things and luxuries_comma_ they cost money. I'll never understand entitled people.
My sister has been begging me to go to a new haunted museum with her.
They scare me enough that I guess I do believe. I don't want to go because I fell like I will get freaked out and have bad dreams.
My girlfriend has been so busy with work lately_comma_ it's left me feeling neglected. But she's working hard to pay off her student loans and to build her savings_comma_ so I have to respect that. But at the same time_comma_ we're long distance_comma_ so the time I have with her when she actually isn't working isn't that fulfilling_comma_ either.
Yeah_comma_ we've had multiple conversations. But it always comes back to her not being able to budge on the time she can commit to her job. And with the long distance thing_comma_ there's less of an immediate necessity for her to change her commitment. It's a work in progress.
I am really glad to see how hard my son is working
He got his first job and he has been really responsible with it and it has been 4 months
We finished painting most of my brother's room today. I think we'll be able to get his room done well before he comes back next weekend.
Away for college. He's been sounding stressed lately_comma_ so we thought we'd redo his room to surprise him.
I got in a bit of an altercation with a co-worker today_comma_ and I'm afraid it may lead to me losing my job. It started with a misunderstanding_comma_and when they didn't want to simply accept that it was a misunderstanding after I apologized_comma_ I decided to simply defend myself and there was a verbal back-and-forth witnessed by a few people. This is not the image I wanted to have at my job...
Yeah. I didn't want to seem like a whiny brat_comma_ but I didn't want to seem like a pushover either_comma_ especially when I thought it was stupid to fight about it to begin with. If I lose my job_comma_ it won't be the worst thing_comma_ since it's just a part-time job to get me through college. But I still hate the feeling that I let people down_comma_ or that I look dumb in other people's eyes.
A possom was waiting outside my door.
He seem harmless enough_comma_ so I gave him some food.
I had lost my iPad in an airport a week ago_comma_ and even though it had my contact information_comma_ I wasn't sure it'd be returned to me. I just figured it was gone for. But it showed up today_comma_ in the same condition!
Yeah_comma_ I know! I feel like I need to go buy a lottery ticket or something. I had already started looking online for replacements_comma_ and it came in today. Things like that restore your faith in humanity_comma_ as stupid as that sounds. I mean_comma_ it's just an iPad. I'm lucky to even have one. So_comma_ I did feel a little childish getting that sad over it.
I am still goin to court for child support.
Its been ten years and it doesnt even show up half of the time. I told the judge the last time I don't even want it anymore.
I hope so. They deseve the best and I plan to give it to them
I was aggravated at myself when I failed my science test. I could have done more
Yeah_comma_ I will do better next time for sure
I have to deal with an entitled person lately and I can't stand it. 
Oh man...SO TRUE! It really makes me want to be nasty. Behaving like a dictator is not acceptable from even a dictator!
I got a ticket today for not coming to a complete stop at a stop sign. So I stopped but they didn't think it was long enough. Ridiculous.
Yes.  I'm a great driver with a perfect record but did I get a warning?  No.  I got a ticket but I'm going to contest it in court.  
My mom is doing her best to put me through college on her own. She raised me and my brother by herself_comma_ and while doing so she put enough aside to cover a chunk of my college expenses somehow. I guess she invested some of they money her grandparents left her_comma_ and it turned out to really pay off. She surprised me with this and I had no idea she was going to do that. I don't deserve her.
She is! I try to tell her as much as I can. But she's very humble_comma_ so she doesn't pay attention to it. I've been trying to strategize on ideas of how I can properly show her that I appreciate all that she's done. It feels like everything would be too little a sentiment.
MY kids are my favorite people in the world.
Two girls and one boy.  I want them to live with me forever. Their kids too lol
Time will tell. I think they are pretty cool though.
I don't like to go shopping at big stores.
I feel panicked. I don't like being around a lot of people at once. I wish I didn't feel that way but I just don't like big stores and lots of people.
I am hoping my brother is going to make my birthday. He can get busy though with work
Yeah that is true sadly
I just accomplished one of my biggest dreams and I feel like things are just perfect right now.
I just bought my dream house at the beach!  I'm moving there next week!
Well I am in a relationship kind of..but they are away and I can't talk to them so I am quite lonely. 
It depends on what they do in therapy. I cannot live with them they way they have been so it's a pickle.
<3 Thank you! Truly!
I've owned 3 birds in the past 10 years and my 3rd bird just died last night. I didn't realize how much it would crush me. They were my buddies.
Thank you.  That's so sweet of you to say.  They were parakeets named Snowball_comma_ Curacoa_comma_ and Panda.  I think the best thing for me to do is get another one soon to continue to enjoy their sweet personalities.
My significant other woke up last night with... a roach inside of her ear! She was complaining about pain in her ear_comma_ and a head ache that was incredibly severe. So_comma_ we took her to the doctor and he saw it with a light... and put water in her ear to get it out. Disgusting!
I'm sorry! I didn't mean for that. Yeah_comma_ some smaller ones--heck_comma_ even bigger ones_comma_ can get up there. And then they get stuck_comma_ and they freak out_comma_ so they're essentially just biting the inside of your head to try and get out. It's horrible to think about_comma_ and I've been trying to comfort her since when it happened a little bit ago. But she's getting over it soon. The weird thing is we don't even really ever see bugs in our house_comma_ so it was kind of like a one in a million thing. I bet she sleeps with ear plugs in her eyes for the next few years though...
Grocery shopping today was the worst
I filled the cart_comma_ got to the register. and I had left my purse at home
It was sych a waste if time
I was a bit irritated when the police bothered me the other night when I was simply walking. They do this a lot here.
I know right? I can't wait to move. Seems like I can't ever go walking at night without them rolling up as if they don't have a million other things to do.
It can be hard to wake up sometimes when you live alone.
Wow really? I have before and now I am again. It's hard! You wake up and think..what is going on_comma_ where am I..Oh yeah!
The past 2 weeks. It's a change. better then abuse though
Just got a new job after being without one for a couple months now.
Thank you. Yea. It was very scary and stressful.
The mechanic who came to fix our air conditioner overcharged us by $200
Who would I report him to? I did write a bad Yelp review.
I got all the classes I wanted this semester
Yep. Last semester I wasnt so lucky
My new neighbors just moved in_comma_ and they are around my age. Hope we can be friends.
Oh I've got terrible neighbors_comma_ too. I know that feeling. I hope these are a lot better.
Sometimes I just love sitting around doing nothing
I guess you're right lol
Not at all lol
I went by my old school_comma_ and so much has changed.
Yea_comma_ it does. Took me a moment to recognize the place.
My electric bill is twice as high as last month
I have no idea. i am so mad
I asked my roomie if he wanted cake_comma_ and he said no. Turns out he ate all my cake.
I called him out on it.
I went to an Italian restaurant for dinner earlier.
I thought it was pretty good_comma_ not the greatest but good enough.
I had the Pasta Puttanesca.
There's nothing like being in your house after all your relatives have left after coming over for a long weekend visit. It's nice to see them_comma_ but once the frenetic energy is done with and you can kick your feet up... it's rewarding
I'm glad to have seen them and caught up with them_comma_ and to hear what they've been up to. But man does it get annoying to deal with the crowd and the mess. And plus the extra money spent to feed them! Well_comma_ I have six months until I see them again.
I am looking forward to getting a new vacuum on Tuesday.
I'm going with a Hoover. Yes I love things clean!  I haven't bought a new vacuum in years. It's long overdue.
I hear you! But some of us like a good machine. Personally I like Kirbys best and the old kind from Ebay etc. They work better then anything. Sharks work pretty good too. I guess we gals might think of cleaning tools like cars lol
 I almost got hit by a semi truck today on the highway. It scared me half to death.
I know_comma_ I always try to_comma_ but my wife was in labor so she was making me pass everyone on the road.
My son has been having stomach pain for months now and the doctors can't figure out what it is. They basically say he has to get worse for them to find a diagnosis if some new problem comes up. I'm so scared.
What is that?  None of the doctors told me about that.  I will look into it.  Thank you! You've given me hope I never knew I had!
There is a little cat I tried to help last night.
He ran when my dog charged at him though and I am scared of what has happened to him. A lot of cats get hit around here
MY children are making me mad
I told them to go to bed hours ago. I can still hear them giggling
They do that every night. I cant wait for school to start.
We were having a big family gathering and dinner today_comma_ and one of my nephews_comma_ who's four_comma_ wasn't feeling well. But his parents kept trying to force him to eat something anyway_comma_ and were being short-sighted. Well_comma_ the poor fella ended up puking onto his plate and ending everyone's appetite.
Yeah_comma_ me too! I tried to comfort him afterwards. There's only so much you can do. No one was brave enough to chastise the parents for trying to get him to eat more than he should.
My friend worked really hard this semester. I'm sure he'll do great.
I actually look up to him. Makes me want to work harder.
I didn't get a chance to make dinner for my date_comma_ so I got her McDonalds
She seem kind of surprised_comma_ but she did eat everything. Not a fry survived.
My husband is coming home after a year abroad in the Army. I'm about to burst I'm so happy!
I did...immensely.  Its the hardest thing I've ever endured with him leaving_comma_ especially because I have to young kids.  We're going to have a huge party!
I'm going water skiing next weekend. It's going to be such a breather from all this heat we've been getting lately.
Neither have I. I'm looking forward to it.
My daughter has be begging me to watch the movie IT

Something that helps kids with clothing and other essentials for school. 
Hopefully we can get it going.
Last week I found my gold fish floating at the top of the fish tank dead.
I am so hurt over it.  It was 5 years old.
Learned earlier today that I had been drinking all day out of a cup that had been used earlier by someone who has bronchitis. I'm hoping it's not too contagious... Why can't people properly clean and put things away so I don't confuse dirty dishes with clean dishes!
Well_comma_ we'll see. I'm generally pretty healthy and haven't been to the doctor in like over 6 years for anything other than the flu. So_comma_ hopefully my immune system will keep it at bay. But it was just it's something so simple and avoidable_comma_ and they didn't do it. I guess I should feel more empathy for them though_comma_ since they're sick.
ended up getting a pizza from Costco. I'm so hungry
Not really. I kinda feel like I don't get much_comma_ but their food court stuff is great value for the money.
I let my friend borrow my car today
I was fine until she brought it back with no gas and left trash allover the seat. I couldnt believe it
I know. She lost that privilege
I just bought a lawn mower because mine broke and the grass was getting so long. I barely had it 3 days when my shed was broken into and it was stolen! I'm so irate!
I know. it really ruins any faith I have in people.  Plus_comma_ it was so much money that I had saved for quite a while and now I'm back to square one.  I could explode thinking about it.
My father and brother are in a serious conflict with each other right now_comma_ as my father has complained about the way my brother raises his son. Obviously it's a really stressful_comma_ tenuous situation and I have no idea who's side to take_comma_ and I'm worried it will lead to them not wanting to keep in touch anymore.
Yeah_comma_ you're right. It's kind of complicated_comma_ but I definitely shouldn't try to pick sides. I just want everyone to get along_comma_ but it's not that simple. It's like I can't figure out if I try to make peace_comma_ whether that will make things more complicated or not_comma_ and whether I should just stay out of it. Time will tell.
I woke up one morning and found a puppy in my bed. I wasn't expecting that!
That sounds like a fun Christmas morning.  For me it was a fine surprise.  I think my wife got it for herself_comma_ but surprised me with it.
I lent my car to my 17-year-old sister today. She left at 10 in the morning and it's midnight_comma_ and she still isn't back with it. I trust her mostly_comma_ but she hasn't been driving for long_comma_ and it makes me nervous thinking of her out there on the road
I tried_comma_ and she didn't pick up. I texted her a few times_comma_ and she's responded here and there_comma_ letting me know her whereabouts_comma_ and that's she's fine. But we had an agreed upon time that she's not following_comma_ so I don't feel like she's respecting my trust. We'll have to have a talk when she comes home.
Just moved and there is a pier near where I live
Yea. I'm so used to living in the center of the city. Nothing but cars and buildings. I already feel so relaxed here.
I won a year of unlimited pizza. I'm so psyched.
Yea_comma_ it is. If I'm ever tired of cooking_comma_ I can always get pizza.
I am so ready to light a candle and bingewatch
Not sure yet.  I just finished Nashville and ready to move on to something else
I saw firsthand today how caring my cousin can be with children. She was being patient and cooperative with my unruly and difficult two-year-old nephew_comma_ and she's only 13-years-old herself. I was pretty proud of how she handled the difficult situation_comma_ and it made me imagine her as a mother in the future.
Yeah_comma_ that's true. He's just a distant relative_comma_ so she doesn't see him often. But you're right_comma_ I shouldn't immediately assume she would have them. I just think she'd be good with them_comma_ is all. But kids these days seem to be a little more picky about whether or not they'll have children_comma_ so we'll see.
My friends are always flaking on me
I have to get a baysitter and spend moen just to prepare to go out. Its so inconsiderate. I think I need new friends.
That's really good advice. I can have a better time with other peopl.

I was walking back home today_comma_ and I had to go through the front yard. The summer time means lots of rain_comma_ and so the grass gets a little tall. While I was walking through it_comma_ I stepped on a snake! I screamed like a little baby and jogged away really fast
Yeah_comma_ me too. I find them interesting_comma_ but would never want them as a pet or anything. Seeing them once every few years in a zoo is fine with me. This one was a black snake_comma_ but that's all I really remember. Didn't get a good look. It slithered away fast. I think it was as scared of me as I was of it.
My senior year wasn't nearly as good since my brother left for college that same year.

I was playing with football with my two nephews_comma_ just throwing the ball around_comma_ and I threw the ball too high and hard for my younger nephew. It sailed past him and nailed the neighbor's car behind him_comma_ and left a dent in the door. I felt so stupid having to go up to their house and tell them what happened..
They were pretty respectful and understanding_comma_ and realized that those things just happen_comma_ especially when kids are involved. They appreciated that I came and told them right away. Mostly it was because the dent isn't that serious and they feel like they can get it out without much problem. But yeah_comma_ I'm glad I don't have a jerk for a neighbor who would have blown up
I haven't played my flute in years. Picked it up the other day_comma_ and I was still able to play my favorite songs.
When I was around 8 years old.

I  had no income to pay my bond.  So I accepted the plea bargain just to get out of county jail sooner than later

Thank you_comma_ maybe I need to find a more expensive alternative then haha.

She did!  It really made my day too.  I wish I could go back and take the time to reach out more to my loved ones. 
I became friends with a girl in college. I was jealous of the men she dated_comma_ especially as she told me she would have dated me if we weren't friends.

Someone broke and ran into my mailbox this morning. I can't believe they didn't even leave a note...
It is totaled. I have to get a whole new mailbox and I am furious!
I am ready for my job interview in a couple days. I have everything I need from attire to answers to questions!
Thanks! I feel very prepared for it!
I was raped. I have just gone for a test to know if I am pregnant or I caught a disease from the bad experience
Its ok _comma_ I am so anxious about my status 
At the end of the year_comma_ a good friend of mine who I haven't seen in a while is coming down to visit.
6 years. But we've kept in touch over social media ever since he moved.
I purchased my first new vehicle yesterday.
Its not the cheapest but_comma_ i've always baught used and wanted something new for once when it comes to vehicles.
I left my house today with a shirt that had a hole in it. I didn't notice until a stranger pointed it out and I was so ashamed!
Except one stranger did and I was so embarrassed_comma_ lol. I wish I had checked the back side before I left my house_comma_ ugh.
i started off planting season with a few small seedlings and some plants from seed. i was anticipating the growth of my plants 
some grew very big others didn't do so well
probably next year. it's too late in the season to retry this year.
I almost had a crash today!
Yes_comma_ I am just a little upset right now.
I found albums of old pictures in my attic when I was a little kid. I miss the old days when I had no responsibilities!
I actually do have a twin_comma_ lol. I miss the good ol' days!
When I was young I loved to spit off of my 10th floor balcony. One day I spit and a lady happened to be walking by at the wrong time.
Well she looked up and was counting the floors. I ran inside terrified and felt so bad.
I was offered a higher paying position at my job_comma_ but I'm not sure if I'll accept it due to the added stress.
I don't know. I believe we only get one life_comma_ and I'd rather spend my time enjoying life rather than working it away.
I bought new flavor of coffee today from Starbucks. I was so shocked at how bad it was. I'm never going to try a new coffee flavor.
Exactly. That's why I'm going back to my old ways so I don't get disappointed like that.
I was so upset when I lost my wallet last week. I looked all over for it and could not find it anywhere.
Well I was going to give up and cancel all my cards when I got a knock on my door. It was a nice lady with my wallet! I was so thankful I gave her $50.
I haven't been to the doctor in ages and I need to take a physical soon. I feel great though_comma_ so I think it'll turn out well!
I do exercise a lot_comma_ which is why I haven't gone to the doctor in so many years. Kind of a bad habit not to get checked up_comma_ though.
Hi_comma_ Are you afraid of the snakes?
That's a big problem. I almost stepped on one like 30 minutes ago!
There was a guy I liked and my friend knew it but she set him up with our other friend instead!
I was really upset especially since they are seriously dating now and I have to see them everywhere!
yes_comma_ true_comma_ but there's probably someone out there better than him!
I lost a couple of loved ones last year and I can't get it off my mind. 
I don't think it's at that point yet_comma_ but it has been making me feel down pretty often. Mostly at night when trying to sleep.
Do you like to drink the coffee drinks?
You would have been mad at me this morning!
Nope_comma_ I drank it all to myself!
It was such a relief that I knew the work they were doing in school.
It was calculus and i hadn't done it in 2 years.
I got my results back from my doctor and I am so scared. I think I might have cancer...
I am terrified at the moment. I don't know how much longer I have to live.
I played a video game last night that I hadn't played since the 90's. Brought back so many memories.
Absolutely! It makes the game even more enjoyable.
My friend let me borrow their car for the weekend. I feel like our relationship is on another level!
A few years now. I can't believe how trusting she is of me to let me borrow her car for a few days. I owe her a lot!
No_comma_ I just needed a car for some errand this weekend and she kindly let me borrow it. She is great!
Hi friend_comma_ how is your day going today?
My day is just lovely! I drank big coffee and had hot chats.
The other night I was having this dream where I felt like I was getting rained on. It was a really weird feeling.
Well I eventually opened my eyes and saw my dog was licking me all over. I was so shocked I was speechless for a bit.
This morning I ran over my neighbors mail box. When getting home later that afternoon I noticed it was back up. I hope he doesn't know it was me!
That's the first thing I thought of! I don't remember ever seeing a camera there. I do feel pretty terrible_comma_ though.
I am having a baby! I will learn the gender today!
I think it's a girl!
Visiting Disneyland recently made me feel extremely nostalgic.
For sure!  I went there a lot as a kid_comma_ because my grandparents lived right near Anaheim.
Yes_comma_ we had fun.  Disneyland is the on in California and "world" is the one in Florida.  
I forgot the make my credit card payment yesterday. I feel so bad because I told myself all day yesterday not to forget.
I think so. I am feel so guilty because the interest was so avoidable. I forget so many things all the time...
You might be right_comma_ I'll look into this. Thank you.
It was amazing seeing my mother graduate today!
I am so proud_comma_ she is 50 and it's her first degree.
I think we're going to have a grad party on the weekend.
I'm looking forward to my cousin's future! She is almost done with med school and is getting married soon!
She is currently studying neurology so I think that is something to do with the brain? 
She hasn't told me yet_comma_ but I am anticipating it to be in Hawaii or some other island!
Sooo scary! I was in the basement today and I swear to you I saw a ghost
I know but I wasn't expecting it.. and it looked like my mom.
I was afraid she would start yelling at me LOL
I got on a roller coaster yesterday and I ended up puking everywhere! I just wanted to disappear!
I definitely was! I felt so shame that I couldn't look anyone in the eyes for the rest of the day.
I went to an Imagine Dragons concert this weekend and it was awesome! I don't regret going at all.
They are awesome. I was so impressed how good they were live. I didn't think listening to them live was better than with my headphones!
I helped one of my close friends lose over 60 pounds last year.
I taught them how to diet and exercise properly. But I have to give them huge credit for being consistent and sticking with it!
I am so happy for my dad. He finally paid off his student debt loans after all these years. I can see a change in his demeanor and I feel so ecstatic for him!
I know it really sucks. I am so proud of him getting through the tough times and he finally made it.
I am angry  with my mother for not telling me who my father is
Yes I knew from my mother's best friend
I just won something from calling into the radio channel!
Me neither! I get one thousand dollars on the gift card for John's shoe repair and tailoring!
I just heard there was an earthquake in Indonesia.
It was really strong I think many people died.
Yes I feel awful for people in such tragedies particularly those that lose loved ones.
My boss screwed up on his work and told HIS boss that it as me!
It definitely is. I would have preferred to get him fired_comma_ but I have no evidence of his screw up to show!
Ok.. So I will admit it. I pee'd my pants the other day. At work.
No.. I had to sneak out and hope no one saw me.  LOL.  I think I was successful because I haven't heard anything bout it yet.
I had an interview yesterday_comma_ I'm confident I got the job.
That's a very good point! But still_comma_ doesn't hurt to hope.
So I took a picture of myself at a battlefield and there was a ghostly smudge over me that wasn't in the image before or after it.
Awful_comma_ because honestly what I was doing in the photo at the time wasn't very respectful to the actual site_comma_ I didn't think about it at the time.
No.. but after when I saw them I felt HORRIBLE for what I did there in the photo..
Yesterday I bought a croissant inn the bakery and when I paid they gave me the wrong change.
Not the worst part is that cashier insisted I had given her $10 when I was sure it was $20.
I had to speak to the manger to get my money back.
I did and he gave me my money but nothing else.
I have been feeling so alone lately :(
my wife works night shifts as a nurse so i am often home by myself
Oh thats a good idea_comma_ I never thought of that
I think I was tired because I was up all night studying. I guess I was very clumsy that day. 
I ended up dropping my lunch tray in front of a girl I was attracted to!
I am very happy that I have graduated today!
I am very proud. And I will celebrate by going to Disney Land!
I am so happy for all the presents that I got at my birthday party!
Yes and it was at Disney Land!
Today was my one day to sleep in_comma_ and I got woken up early by the construction workers making noise early this morning
They started hammering away at 7am.  I think I am going to call their boss and complain.  Maybe ill call him tomorrow at 7am
I see this guys at the skate park do a really cool 360 trick on the half pipe last week!
Yeah_comma_ I can only hit the little jumps. I'm too much of a beginner to hit the half pipe. The guy was on fire!
Ugghhh!  My neighbor's dog has gone to the bathroom in my yard again!!
I usually leave it on their front door step.  lol.
I am having a nice afternoon on my computer here_comma_ having some nice chats with people.
I bet.  I have a secret though.  I am in love with this person I have been chatting with.
I work with high school dropouts. One of my students went above and beyond to complete their last course and finish high school. It was very inspiring. He even invited me to his graduation!
It's in the fall and yes_comma_ I absolutely will!
He may just work for a few years before he decides. 
Always embarrassing to fall off my dirtbike!
I did_comma_ had so many cuts on my leg. Mom had to bandage me up.
It was fine_comma_ just my leg was all mangled. The cop drove me home thankfully.
Very thankful that it wasn't worse.
Hi_comma_ do you like feeding ducks or other birds?
What is your favorite part of the duck?
I need some advice on if I should say something
I went to the store the other day and when they were ringing me up_comma_ some of my stuff didn’t scan_comma_ so I got $20 worth for free.
On my way to work today_comma_ some guy just cut me off in his car. Can you believe that?
Yes I did_comma_ I let him know he needed to at least use his indicators. He didn't even signal!
We had a departmental meeting at work recently that made me feel really anxious.  We're trying to figure out who our new department head should be.

I am a proud  father of 3 lovely girls
That's alright_comma_ they are 8 years old and they are triplets  :)
I put my dog in dog classes so he would learn to behave. He didn't like it at first but started to make progress.
A blue heeler. Well eventually he graduated and was the top dog of his class. I am beaming with pride at his accomplishments!
I have a crush on this person_comma_ and I dont know if they like me_comma_ and I don't want to ask and be rejected.
I can only hope.. hope and hope.. such is the life of a hoper..
Love isn’t fair sometimes.  You know what I mean?
This girl at work and I have perfect chemistry and we always seem to hit it off.  Well I just found out that she has a boyfriend.  So not fair.  
I realized this morning when I was waiting for the bus that I forgot to bring any change. Someone ended up paying for my bus ride!
Yes_comma_ I was very happy about it. There are still nice people in this world. 
I lost my favorite shoe today!
I don't know. But now I am upset because I wasn't able to make it to my favorite gym!
I was going to be late for gym practice. But my friend helped me to find my missing shoe. Now I will be on time!
I left it beside my TV.
My friend needed a car this weekend_comma_ so I let her use my new car.
She is. Perfect driving record and very reliable. I'm not worried about it.
It went so much better than expected_comma_ she loves me back!
It's not an animal it's my girlfriend
Thank you! No shes beautiful_comma_ want to meet her sometime?
I baked a batch of cookies for my kid's birthday party. The only problem was I couldn't resist eating a few before the party. They were so good.
They were chocolate chip_comma_ my favorite. Well before I realized it I had eaten every cookie. I felt so bad that the guests would not get any!
I can't believe they cut me from that team.
The local baseball team_comma_ I did my tryouts and it didn't go well!
Agreed the hot dogs are delicious.
I will do my best and for sure will.

OMG he is so dreamy!!  Everything I want in a man.
I'm not sure.  I will let you know!
I will send you an invitation.  All expenses paid.
I have a new born who is only 6 months old. He just started to talk_comma_ or make funny sounds at least!
Yes it is_comma_ I'm a very happy dad. He's going to be so smart. 
I have really been shocked at how cool some of the people I have met on the internet are.
I met a psychic healer in a chat room.  He said he could heal people from anywhere in the world.
I had booked a trip to Paris for me and my spouse but she fell and broke her leg about 6 weeks before we were supposed to go. We had to postpone for 6 months.

Well_comma_ I went to Ireland in July_comma_ so I think I should stay home and save some money! Do you like to travel?
I am going to watch my kid get the degree soon!
He was studying the science degree. I am not sure what type.
I am going back to school this semester and decided to get everything ready well in advance. 
Yeah_comma_ I try to stay as organized as possible. It helps stay on top of things.

Yes_comma_ yes I do. It was The Notebook.  I just got really emotional watching it.
I just found out that my cousin passed away after his battle with colon cancer. He was only 27. I am so upset!
Oh my gosh. Im so sorry to hear that.  My thoughts and prayers are with your family
My pilot certification test is coming up next week. I am so nervous I won't remember all the answers. I will be devastated if I flunk the test.
Well I just hope I don't draw blanks under pressure. Maybe I will go study some more when I am done talking to you.
My coworker just got selected to enroll in a leadership class offered by my work. I also applied but didn't get selected. I really wish I was in his shoes righyt now!
I'm not sure.  I thought I was more qualified than him.  It seems like I can never get what other have.
My 11 year old cat died this morning...
Yes I think so_comma_ he was all grey and stuff. Had arthritis too.
Hey this guy who lives with me wasn't doing his scheduled work_comma_ and I had to talk to him about it.. 
Yeah_comma_ he was being really uncooperative and seemed to not care about other people's time.
I feel the same way_comma_ a couple of my other roommates agreed and I think he learned.
My dog has been having health issues. I took him to the vet and they couldn't find anything wrong.
Yeah I am praying it is nothing too serious. They said he may have ate something that made him not feel good.
I was so aggravated today while I was installing a new light fixture in my dining room!!
I did_comma_ but something shorted out and blew out my dimmer switch. I had to make another trip to Home Depot to fix it.
I didn't have enough money to pay my rent this month so I took the money from the cash at work. I feel terrible.
yeah_comma_ well I couldn't risk loosing any more money. I don't know what to do.
I always play the lotto_comma_ but I got a good feeling about tonight!
Oh yea_comma_ all 1000 of them!
Last week I cleaned my house when my kids were off at summer camp. I was so glad I got it done.
Funny you say that. I had to run an errand last night and when I came home it was even messier than before. I nearly lost it!
I was feeling so sentimental while looking through old photos of my kids today. They grow up too fast!
It sure is! It makes me wish they were still babies!
I have a two week vacation coming up in Greece that I've been looking forward to!
To be honest_comma_ I haven't planned it out all that much. I like to adventure as I go! But_comma_ I will definitly be seeing Santorini
I know you won't believe me_comma_ but I just won the lottery!
I won one billion dollars_comma_ and I only have to share it with five other winners!
I love looking after my grandma! She is 94 and it makes me feel good to help her in any way I can!
She deserves it for everything she has done throughout her life. 
I was watching the World Cup on TV recently. I was so amazed at how good those players are.
I have only played a couple times. It is impressive how much energy they have and how good their accuracy is.
I am going to my home town today. Will be visiting for my brother's graduation!
I am flying!
I've been working a great new job the past month and can finally afford a nice apartment. I feel great.
Yeah_comma_ I feel on top of the world these day!
I remember one time when I was little I was running around in the basement when I wasn't supposed to be.
Yeah_comma_ my mom had told me multiple time to not run in the basement. Next thing I know_comma_ I tripped on a lamp cord making the lamp fall and break into pieces.
No_comma_ she was glad I didn't get hurt. But months later I ended up with glass from that lamp in my foot.
it was pouring down rain when i got home so i grabbed all my stuff and got ready for a break in the rain so i could get in the house without getting soaked.
yes thankfully i was able to get in the house without rain falling on me
yeah except i had to walk thru the rain puddles to make it into the house so my shoes and the bottom of my pants got wet.
I saw the new Jurassic Park movie the other day. It was such a let down for me.
Same here!  It is one of my favorite movies!  For some reason_comma_ the new one just falls flat for me.  I expected so much more.
When I cross a major street I am always worry about getting hit by a car. I try to be careful and only cross at the crosswalk but I am still nervous.
Yes I look both ways and never use my cell phone in the intersection. Sometimes I wish I wasn't soch a worry-wort.
 I lent my friend 500$ and she never paid me back. Ugh. I am too nice sometimes.
I think she will.  I hope she will.  I feel betrayed.
THank you.. I appreciate it!  I wish everyone was nice like you.
I try and visit my grandmother every weekend. She's getting old and I'm not sure how much time she has left.
She is very happy when I visit. I want her to be happy all the time!
I haven't seen my girlfriend in awhile. She told me today she was coming to visit me!
Yes we are going to have a date. I am thinking Disney Land!
I was feeling hungry a little while ago until I thought back on that time I ordered a submarine sandwich and had the grossest experience.
I took three bites into the sandwich_comma_ and about half way as I pulled back from the sandwich was a hair connected from my mouth being pulled out of the food. I've never experienced something like that from fast food.
Haha_comma_ I like that you looked on the brightside of that situation at least?
i was trimming dead leaves off of my tomato plants and ended up getting swarmed by mosquitos.
bug spray doesn't do anything for me.
we have bats like crazy here. i wish they would eat up all the mosquitos.
I can't complain about anything right now. I have a roof over my head_comma_ a decent job_comma_ and a wonderful family.
Life is good for both of us then. I am thankful every day that I am so blessed.
I don't know what to do. I played a game of poker with some sketchy guys and now I owe them a lot of money.
I don't think so. I have bad credit. They drive by my house late at night_comma_ I don't know what to do.
Hi_comma_ have you ever eaten a sandwich with hard bread?
No_comma_ what does it mean?
I was at the baseball game sitting in the outfield. I heard a loud crack from the batter.
How did you know? I actually followed the ball all the way with my eyes and caught it bare-handed. I was on TV too!
I am a little scared. I found out my neighbor is a satan worshiper.
Well I am not christian_comma_ and in a way.. who am I to knock someone else for theirs
My girlfriend has a new yoga instructor names Mark. He is such good shape_comma_ I feel a bit weird about her going to his classes.
Well yes_comma_ my instructor Marissa is so dreamy. But still... I see the way she looks at Mark.
In a few weeks my best friend and I are going to go see Ben Folds_comma_ I can't wait.
Yeah_comma_ my friend and I have been fans since 2004. We've seen him over ten times but we go every time he's into town because he never puts on the same show twice.
I had a test today and was very nervous about it.
It was fine and now I will be able to graduate!
i really miss my family. we are 800 miles away from each other.
i try to go once a year but money is tight right now.
i don't know if i could possibly make more than i am currently
i love seeing halloween commercials before october hits _comma_ it makes me feel like a kid again
me too _comma_ just seeing the m and ms _comma_ or cereal halloween commercials makes me smile
I bought a lottery ticket a few days ago. I felt so confident it was going to win the jackpot!
Unfortunately I didn't win anything. I was crushed because my expectations were so high!
I am waiting for this storm to approach
I don't watch the tv. I can hear it sounds pretty bad though and I forecast that it could become a tornado!
Yesterday my hamster passed away. He was barely two years old :(.
His name was Sparky. I reached into his cage to pick him up because he was not moving. His poor body was cold. I was so tearful.
I went to church and everything this week. Maybe I will be blessed in my career!
Oh I am a believer then!
i found an old pyrex bowl at the store yesterday like the one my mom used to make tuna casserole in.
it did. i wish it wasn't $40.00 for the set or i would've bought it.
it was an antique shop so i doubt it.
I have a bunker in my back yard with a ton of food in case of a natural disaster.
Maybe I do! I have enough food for about a year_comma_ so I should be set for a while.
The storm is coming_comma_ I can hear it with my ears!
I am not. No storm shelter or saved up food. I hope I won't be washed away!
I got so irritated when I was driving the other day!
I got pulled over and I was given a speeding ticket for going 55 in a 50MPH zone.
When my spouse walked out on me and my kids I was so glad to have my friends. They brought me food and babysat for me.
I have two. My friends were there for me when I needed them most. I am so grateful for them.
I got a special present last year!
It was a new gaming system! I didn't think I would get it but it was wrapped with everything else!
I went to a new restaurant last friday and they asked what sauce i would like my food to be cooked with _comma_ i said give me the spice dragon thinking it was gonna be hot _comma_ it was sweet and tangy i only ate a bit and left the rest there
it really was _comma_ i really dont like sweet food at all_comma_ i cant even stand candy
I just won the lotto and now I can finally finish my storm shelter! I will finally be safe from all these twisters!
Good idea! I will start making a list right now!
I lost a little bit of weight recently and last week I felt more confident in a bathing suit.
20 pounds so far.
It becomes a habit once you get used to it. I can't wait to go to the gym now!
I had the most amazing time the other night and I am so happy and I feel like I'm on cloud 9.
I’ve been talking to this girl I met online and we went out on a great date.  We had so much fun.  Im 100% sure we’re going to go out again soon.
I miss when I was a child. I didn't have to do anything besides school and play with my friends.
Now I have to work and pay bills. Responsibility is overrated. I will take childhood any day!
I was driving along and had a car accident today..
Yes I am fine. And noone else was hurt. But my beautiful new car..
I didn't have any insurance
I met a person at a bar recently who said they were a movie star. I believed him because I didn't know any better.
Yeah I looked up the movie he said he was in and it didn't exist. My friends tell me I am so gullible. Oh well!
I have a new storm shelter and food. But I didn't get anything to play with for the storm.
Yes that is a great one. I will put your ideas onto my list. I will be better prepared for the next storm!
Thank you!
I just got home from work and I cannot even begin to tell you how mad I am right now!
Well_comma_ my dog decided it would be a good day to eat my shoes and then take a poop on my floor_comma_ so i had to scrub the floor clean.
I feel so alone! I'm a single mom and my son just went off to college.
Yes_comma_ that's true! He promised he'd come home often to visit!
I have been looking for a mate for such a long time. I want to find a single mother with an empty nest.
It sure is tough. Every time I find someone online it turns out there is something weird about them. I guess I will be lonely for the rest of my life.
I just made a new friend.
I met them at the store. But there is more..
Exactly_comma_ that is what I heard from my older and more trusted friend!
Whoa! so that was crazy.  You'll never guess what just happened.
So_comma_ I’m just sitting here and I got a text out of the blue from my ex_comma_ telling me that she still loved me.  I was pretty shocked.  Like how do I even respond to that?
Honestly_comma_ I wouldn't mind it. LOL
I was devastated when my pet turtle died. Me and Petey were best friends.
No_comma_ nothing can replace good old Petey. I will mourn him every day and reminisce about the good times we had.
My nephews came over a few days ago and it reminded me of my childhood
Just being carefree and being so excited about everything.
I feel so gratified and rewarded right now.  It feels like it was all worth it
This employee that I helped train when they first started is now becoming a manager.  I feel like I was instrumental in helping them get to where they are now.
I was eating at my favorite Chinese restaurant recently. During one bite I felt a crunch in my mouth.
I looked down and realized I had bitten into a cockroach. I was appalled but finished the food anyway. Guess I got my protein for the day.
A few years ago I saw the cutest puppy at the pound. I brought him home to my son.
He did! He named him snoopy. We still have him today.
I was so pleased with myself for knocking off a lot of tasks in my home remodeling project!
I've been working on the kitchen and dining room. I replaced all of my appliances and installed new light fixtures!
After 2 months of working out I'm finally losing weight and hopeful it's all worth it.
I was pretty overweight. About 5'6" 180 pounds to start with.
I joined a gym and work out 5 days a week. I also started eating healthy... and I wouldn't say "huge"@
I have really wished to have one ever since I lost the one my mum bought during my convocation 
I am talking about a gold watch my grandma bought for me 
It's been awhile now_comma_ but I vividly remember being let go from my job where I'd worked (and sweated and bled) for 11 years.  They claimed it was due to downsizing.
It was_comma_ but honestly it was the best thing for my family.  I had just told them that I was pregnant with my 2nd child and I truly think they did not want to share me with the family I was creating.
I'm having to cancel my Labor Day plans since I have to work.  My boss is taking a trip and we both can't be gone from work.  I'm disappointed.  
I was going to Georgia to watch my cousin's son play in his first college football game.  It was going to be a nice family reunion type trip.
Yes_comma_ that's a great idea.  I might be better later in the season when he's used to everything.  I have to look on the bright side...right?!!!
I was so ashamed of my self the other day! I went to work with two different shoes!
I guess I just didn't realize one was blue and one was black and I didn't have time to go home and change! I had to hide my feet all day!
 I am very glad with my new job
I am working as a broker.My dream job !!!
I apply to 50 different places_comma_ but finally I get it
When our girls were 5 and 7 we made plans to take them to Disney_comma_ but we didn't tell them where we were going.
Well_comma_ at first they were like "But we wanted to go to the beach!" because that's where we told them we were going.  But that faded quickly as they realized where we were staying and what we were doing.  I loved seeing their faces!
My friend wrecked my car when I let him borrow it over the weekend
Well_comma_ it's a giant hassle to manage from the insurance side but apparently they will cover it if he doesn't. Might hike my rates_comma_ though
I was so thrilled when I finally got my new video game I had saved for. I played it for two days straight.
It was God of War. I was so happy I got to play it because I had been anticipating it for such a long time.
it really annoys me at work that i work so hard _comma_ and then slackers get paid the same amount kinda makes me feel invious_comma_ like they just get to walk around and get payed for it
yes i have many times_comma_ but they do nothing about it sometimes it just makes want to quit so they are stuck with all the bad workers 
I stepped in some dog poop walking in my neighborhood the other day.
Yes I was wearing sandals so I went home to wash it off ASAP.
I have to tell you about one of the scariest moments ive had in a long time..
I went to take my dog outside to use the bathroom last night_comma_ and when we walked outside onto the porch there was a giant spider the size of my fist.  I thought it was going to attack me.  I ran back inside so fast.
When we went on vacation last year_comma_ I rode tower of terror. I screamed my head off the entire time.
Yes_comma_ it sure is! No_comma_ I will never ride that again. It had way too many drops.
We did a behind the scenes tour at a local zoo with our daughters and the otters had just had babies!
Honestly I was so focused on those otters - LOL!  I wanted to put one in my pocket and just take it home - they were so adorable!
I moved out of my dad's house when I was 19 and moved to Atlanta.  
It was - even though the company I worked for moved us all down here_comma_ it was still very hard to adjust.  I mean_comma_ being in a big city and not having family around was hard.
I was so thankful that my friend came to pick me up when my car broke down yesterday!
I did_comma_ thankfully! It was an easy repair! My friend was nice enough to take me out to lunch while we waited for the tow truck!
My dog started to get lumps along her stomach so I'm taking her o the vet tomorrow
She's also been refusing food and vomitting so...not looking so good unfortunatly
So I am headed to Mexico for work in about 2 weeks and I am a bit nervous.  I have never been and I am not sure what to expect.
I have been researching a bit.  Every time I do_comma_ I end up looking up information about drug cartels and other scary stuff
I work in a position with a few other coworkers in the same position. One_comma_ who does little work_comma_ recently got a promotion. He was even there less time than me.
It seems like I just need to find a new place to work. That just isn't fair_comma_ but at the same time maybe there's something I'm not seeing.
Our daughters are growing up so fast on us. They are now 18 and almost 16.  I think you blink and the years just fly by.
I'm slowly learning that life is all about changing and it's changing more rapidly than I'd like.  I catch myself on a daily basis remembering things that have already gone on by.
I wish that when people say they are going to do something or make a promise_comma_ that they would stick to it.
I  had plans to go out with my friends tonight_comma_ but suddenly everyone is busy now. and Im stuck home alone
I have an important job interview coming up this week
Very. I feel confident in my abilities_comma_ but of course it does play on the nerves some anyway.
I waited for two weeks for my final grades. It seemed to take forever to get them. I couldn't stand it.
It was worth the wait. I ended with a 3.8 gpa.
My oldest daughter was in a running club at her school_comma_ and she won her very first race.
It was only a mile_comma_ but that's not bad for a 5th grader.  Still_comma_ she did excellent_comma_ and a lot better than the other kids.
My step father passed away last year and my mother moved in with my sister.  She didn't raise me_comma_ so it works out that she's living with my sister.
A little bit bu_comma_ they took the insurance money and bought a big house - i mean BIG! I know they needed more room for my mother to move in_comma_ but what they bought was way over and above what was needed.
One time I opened up my fridge and was shocked to see it was completely empty.
Actually my kids played an April Fools prank on me. They had just taken everything out and hid it. They got me good!
i walked into a church one day and there was a private baptism going on. i was so ashamed. 
no. the door was unlocked so i thought it was safe to go in. boy was i wrong.
i know but i turned beet red and couldn't fumble out of there fast enough. haha
I am feeling pretty good after finishing that last exam.
I will know this Friday. I studied very hard_comma_ so I believe I did well. Fingers crossed.
Yes_comma_ it is the final one. Thank you!
Our daughter's dance program sent out new tuition notices.  They've decided to change the pay structure and everything at the last minute!
I agree_comma_ but they've decided to change how they run the entire place over the summer apparently.  It's going to cost us quite a bit more and we had no warning.
My dog decided to pee on my bed when I wasn't home. Little jerk.
Nope. I only discovered it when I tried to lay down on it too. So gross.
The other day I found an iguana in my backyard.... I hate iguanas! it was horrinle
I had my husband move it away from being so close to our door... I don't like reptiles but i didnt want to throw out into the street either
I am blushing so bad right now_comma_ sometimes technology is not my friend.
I was texting and flirting with this girl and then a female coworker messaged me about work_comma_ and not seeing who i was responding to_comma_ I typed a message that was not meant for her.
Work tomorrow is going to be awkward_comma_ but it could have been a lot worse lol 
My friend won a work contest that we were competing for.  He gets an all expenses trip to St. Louis for a weekend.  I love that town and I wish I was him
I imagine he will take his wife.  He was kind of rubbing it in a bit at work.  I think he was trying to make me even more envious.  
My wife surprised me once with a cruise to the Caribbean. I had no idea she was going to give that to me.
We went to Bahamas_comma_ St. Maarten_comma_ St Vincent_comma_ and Barbados. We had a blast. I love my wife so much!
my dog got loose and got in a fight with another dog. 
the other dog started the fight and my dog got nicked on his snout and tongue.
it scared me to see my dog bleeding but luckily it wasn't worse.
I came home from work to discover that my cat had knocked down the TV
Yes_comma_ yes he did. And of course he didn't care. He was taking a nap next to it when I got back
I'd never had a new car_comma_ always used.  And when I say used_comma_ I mean 1973 VW Bug_comma_ no heat_comma_ no air_comma_ in Atlanta traffic.  That was until I got married.
My husband gave me a brand new car for a wedding present!  We've now been married 22 years and it was the ONLY new car we've ever bought - LOL!  While I loved it_comma_ it's better use of our money to buy used_comma_ but it took us a little while to realize that.
I don't like being in the woods at night. The coyotes make scary noises.
Not really. Unless we are in an RV.
i grew up playing video games all my life_comma_ every time i go to a laundermat or just happen to come across an old arcade at a bar it brings back good memories 
i dont have as much time like when i was a kid_comma_ but i played street fighter yesterday for like 20 minutes with my friend _comma_ and boy did we have fun
I had to get my foot checked out at the doctor recently.
Well I thought it was infected_comma_ but fortunately it wasn't.
I stepped on a snake in our backyard. I screamed so loud!
I have no clue. It was big ad black.
I really do not like doctors.  I hate going_comma_ I am freaked out by surgery_comma_ etc..  
I don't know exactly_comma_ I just don't.  When they decided we needed to do a c-section with my first child_comma_ I think I about lost it.  They had to give me something to calm me down.
My friend got a new puppy and I got to play with it for a while_comma_ it was a lot of fun.
Yeah they can be a handful_comma_ it's a small dog so I think it'll be alright.
My family loves to argue when we get together. It is annoying when we are in a restaurant and won't stop bickering.
You are right. Sometimes I want to be invisible. I wish we would all just get along.
I was driving home from work last night and some guy on his phone started coming into my lane.  I honked and he turned and flipped me off!  The nerve on that guy!
Part of me wanted to follow him and give him a piece of my mind_comma_ but thankfully cooler heads prevailed.  
Hey_comma_ yesterday I forgot I had a test and spent the entire day worrying about it while trying to study. 
I'm not too sure to be honest_comma_ I reviewed as much as I could_comma_ but I'm still worried about the results. 
It was over linear algebra_comma_ which I've been having some trouble in.
We went to Mississippi a few weeks ago I was super prepared for the entire trip.
We stayed at the Margaritaville resort in Biloxi.
Probably the summertime. 
I am feeling a bit left out since I moved to a new country.

In three more days I finally get to go on vacation. I can't wait.
Yeah_comma_ we are hitting the beach. I've been waiting so long.
Have you watched 2018 fifa world cup final?
Yes! You should have watched that game. I felt very influenced by France. They played really good.
I am feeling a bit shocked since I found out my boss is getting married.
No one even knew she was dating anyone until the announcement_comma_ so I was very surprised.
I thought I won a lot of money in a lottery_comma_ but I was just reading the ticket wrong.
Yeah it definitely ruined the rest of my day.
The other day I was watching alpine skiing on TV. I am amazed at their skills.
I did when I was a lot younger. I bet they train very hard. They make it look easy!
a while back when my girl friend left me  i was a little bummed out about it for a while _comma_ everything was different for me
yeah me too thank you for that _comma_ i feel a whole lot better now after time passed - time for the most all heals all 
I went to the Disney land last summer
Yes indeed! It was a thrilling experience!
I had to have a scheduled c-section with my 2nd child.  But it didn't exactly go as planned.
It did_comma_ she will be 16 in a month.  But about a week before it was scheduled_comma_ I went in for a checkup and my blood pressure was up a bit.  They didn't want to wait and decided to do it right then!
I am in the running for a new job I want to get!
In a week! It's a lot of pressure. I sure hope I get it_comma_ it will make my life much easier
On the road that's the only access to our neighborhood there was a dead animal that the city was notified of.
A small doe. The worst part about this was that they decided they had better things to do and didn't get around to cleaning it up for nearly 4 weeks it seemed!
Life was so good during my childhood. I lived carefree and oblivious to challenges.
Yeah I would go off with my friends and have adventures. I miss that so much.
Its amazing how you can change emotions so fast sometimes.
Im in the process of moving_comma_ so I was packing things into boxes and I found my old high school year books.  It was crazy to look back on all those times
Yea_comma_ and some people to! 
I feel a little bummed out since starting my new job recently.
The job is_comma_ but I am feeling a bit isolated since I don't know anyone there yet.
i was exposed to lice at work
nothing_comma_ i had my hair up so hopefully i don't get any
that's one of the risks of working in healthcare i suppose.
I was very mad when France won the world cup! Have you seen the game?
Croatia should have won! I always support them!
i found an old pyrex at the store that was just like the one my mom used to have.

I heard a loud bang late in the night recently and thought someone was trying to break in to my house.
Yes I am fine it was just someone shooting fireworks for some reason.
there was this little boy that kept picking on my little niece one day my niece fought back_comma_ she got her tooth knocked out but im glad she finally defended her self
nah she did not _comma_ none of them did since they are in first grade _comma_ but now the boy leaves her alone
I have been hearing some really strange noises coming from my basement. I am fearful it is a monster.
It is like scraping and creaking. I am too scared to go down there. Maybe I should get a weapon.
So one time I was running late for a flight_comma_ and to make things worse I was stuck in a long line to check my suitcase. It was finally my turn when this woman cut right in front of me.
I did thankfully! The worst part of that situation was I politely told the woman I had been waiting_comma_ and she totally snapped at me! Traveling brings out the worst in people sometimes.
Yeah_comma_ and who knows_comma_ maybe hers was_comma_ but you don't get anywhere by being rude to people.
So today I was out to lunch and the waitress was being super nice to me and calling me sweetie and I thought she was being nice to me just to get a tip_comma_ but guess what happened
Yea_comma_ she asked for me number.  And she just texted me.  She was gorgeous.  I couldn't believe it.
You bet I did.  I always do.  Im nice like that
I'm waiting on my friend to confirm our plans for tonight_comma_ but he's taking so long
I'm not sure. He might be trying to invite someone else as well. He does that from time to time

I am so stoked because I get to visit my family next week. I have not seen them in a long time.
Yeah we are going to the beach and on a short cruise. It's going to be awesome!
My kid trashed my entire bathroom this morning_comma_ was definitely not a good morning.

Man_comma_ I was sitting alone at 3am last night with the lights off. Felt spooky
Yeah_comma_ it wouldn't be so bad if I was with someone_comma_ but you know how it is. When the lights are out and no one is around_comma_ you feel lonely
I was happy when I graduated high school. I felt like I completed something
It really was
My son just graduated this spring and will be starting college in a couple of weeks.
I am_comma_ and excited for him... it's bringing back a lot of memories of how I felt when I was his age.
True_comma_ it just makes me feel a little old!
It was around 2003_comma_ and I invited my family to the Degree Ceremony. I felt succesful because it was not easy for me to be there.

I feel confident since I have been there before on holiday. Thank you very much!
My daughter_comma_ who is only 8_comma_ just landed her first triple back flip in gymnastics this week. I've never been able to do anything like that. It was amazing to watch.
I am!  I was never the gymnast type but she has been bouncing off the walls and climbing and jumping since she was little.  I didn't know they could even do things like that so young.  
I was in a bad spot when my dad died. I just felt lost
It was a random brain thing that got him instantly

I am always worrying about my kids and would hate to see something bad happen to them.
Mine are 14_comma_ 17_comma_ 19_comma_ and 21. It doesn't get any easier as they get older. Once they drive you really worry about them being on the road.

He was definitely mine_comma_ it's going to take a bit to get over him
I didn't have enough money for all of my grocery. When I was going to put some stuff back_comma_ the lady behind me offered to pay.

I think after I pay off the mortgage_comma_ I'll be pretty happy in life.
You mean get the mortgage?
I promised my sister that I would go sky diving with her when she was old enough to_comma_ but I didn't think she's remember. I'm horribly afraid of heights.
I promised her about 8 years ago.  I was much younger also but now I have two kids and don't really want to do it.  Thinking about dying or even just jumping off a ladder_comma_ much less a plane_comma_ seems awful!
Hey how's it going_comma_ finished college last May_comma_ Woot woot
Right now_comma_ I'm sending in a bunch of resumes for jobs_comma_ no bites yet but i'm going to keep trucking
When my brother fell ill we had no idea he would go so quick.
I dont think so_comma_ It was a matter of days.
I didnt study well before my exam and it was in two hours.
Its so hard to stay calm.  Im just hopping for a miracle.
I was helping my mom repain the house_comma_ and it reminded me of when I used to ask her if I can help her paint when I was little.
No. Neither of us are artistic. It's normal painting of rooms.
Met with my friend who I haven't seen in 4 years. Feels like we never left each other
Yea_comma_ it is. Good friends are really hard to find.
Once I fell asleep and peed my pants in class
I woke up with the whole class laughing and pointing
Today was one of those days where I almost lost it on someone.
I got a new car just a couple of weeks ago and today I was sitting at a red light and some guy came really close to hitting me.  Like he stopped only a few inches away.
Once I was sitting next to a kid and he threw up all over me
everyone was either laughing at me or disgusted.
So I have a big meeting at work tomorrow_comma_ which always make me nervous no matter what.
Thank you! Yes_comma_ I think so. I will just have to overcome nerves and do my best I think.
I was completely ready for this upcoming game.  I will win.

I get to go to Italy_comma_ Croatia_comma_ and other places. It's going to be a blast!

She took care of me my whole life_comma_  put me on the correct path

It was just someone shooting fireworks for some reason.
I'm finally done drawing this character for a contest. I think I'm happy with it now.
Yea_comma_ I'm self-taught. Got into it because I like reading comics and like the art.
Today was totally unexpected_comma_ but interesting too
I went to the mall to go shopping and I ran into my ex girlfriend.  It was weird seeing her and thinking about the old times and seeing how much we've changed
Sometimes yes_comma_ sometimes no. But I think we are both in a better place now.
the other day i saw a preview of my favorite game remake _comma_ resident evil two i was super hyped just remembering the old game
the first one was really good too_comma_ i liked mostly all of them to be honest
There is a local cafe near me_comma_ and they're always offering free coffee to people even if they don't buy anything.
I always get a cup and sandwich. They are truly something.
I left my phone at my friend's place. It's unlocked_comma_ and I hope she doesn't go through it.
I hope so_comma_ too. I've called her and haven't gotten a response yet.
I was trying to explain to a friend why something is happening and they just couldn't get it. I don't get why they couldn't understand me. 
I was trying to explain to them why the Great Recession was caused by the recycling of petrodollars and an unrestrained financial market. 
My grandma is very kind. She always makes me delicious cakes
She has her own recipes. Yesterday I went at her place and this time I made a cake for her. When I saw her happy face_comma_ I felt that I was very kind.
I walked in on my buddy and my girlfriend in each others arms
I was just hurt really.  How could I fall in love so easy.
I took my 13 year old shopping for schoo clothes today.
Yes_comma_ but she didn't like anything in the store. We didn't even buy anything I was so upset.
Four hours for nothing.
I got a new job that pays a lot more than my previous one. I should be able to pay off my home sooner now
Yes_comma_ it is. I was at my old job for over 4 years and never got a raise.
Once I accidentally farted very loud in school.
Yes!! and I was yawning so I didnt really hear it.  But everyone else did.
When I heard my brothers name called for graduation i could believe the emotion i felt.
watching him struggle all that time_comma_  It was nice to see him win.
I have some friends over for dinner today

They laughed. I was still embarassed lol
I asked my coworker out. She said yes. I never thought she'd agree.
Thanks a lot. She's a really nice person. Even if things don't work out_comma_ I hope we'll be great friends.
I couldn't wait to give my speech_comma_  I was positive it was going to be well received.
I was trying to convince the convenience of laptop over desktop computers.
Someone asked me for some money to donate to their charity and I told them no. I feel so terrible but I have such a low income that I have to think about my family.
I just feel awful and can't shake the feeling.  I work two jobs though and I have tons of medical bills but I always want to help others.  
I told my mom that I didin't want to be in compsci anymore_comma_ because I was really miserable. She said that I should do what makes me happy.
Thanks. My mom is usually very strict_comma_ and I thought she would be really upset.
Just came back from the park. I saw so many dogs and oddly enough_comma_ cats
they were_comma_ and it was really cute.
Moved to a new city with a lower cost of living. I kind of feel isolated here
Oh wow. What was your reason?
my big brother has always been better than me.
That's true. Yesterday I saw him with a pretty girl and I felt very envious
I am so grateful me and my ex are still friends
I am surprised_comma_ but we are. I think he may be still wishing for a make up
I'm straight. I have moved on
I've been with my employer for 8 years. They're going through a tough time now_comma_ and I'm trying to do my best although the work has been really hectic
Business has been really bad. I'm hoping for miracle_comma_ but it doesn't look good.
I have applied to 5 different colleges this year.
I havent gotten any letters back yet_comma_ but I am very confident
I've been planning this vacation for a while. Think I've got everything covered for a good time.
Going to Las Vegas!
I just found out that my entire family planned a beach vacation trip together and didn't include me. I am dumbfounded and irate!
My mom called and told me because she felt bad.  My siblings are taking them for free so I'm not mad at them but I'm definitely mad at my brother and sister!  They didn't say a thing_comma_ even when i mentioned it.
I once put my shoe on only to realize that there was a dead animal in it.
IT was a mouse!! so gross.  I was traumatized for a week.
I'm going to volunteer at a local food bank. I hope I can make a positive difference.
How are you now?
I am trying a new diet and it not as hard as ones I have tried before.
No bread_comma_ no soda_comma_ salads and wraps_comma_ and lots of water. I like all of those things so I'm fine with it
I just started so I am hoping for the best since I enjoy it so much. I have never enjoyed a diet.
When I was ten my favorite friend moved to a new state.
I treid to keep in touch but we drifted away.  I hope he is happy in his life though.
A new amusement park is going to open near me. I won't have to drive an hour to the nearest one anymore.
I love it! It's so much fun. I didn't go often because of the distance.
When the girl leaned in for a kiss all I could see was my beautiful wife whom I love.
No she wasnt_comma_  But I knew I could never kiss her.
i felt bad when i couldnt get a gift my daughter wanted
a horse
I was not sure whether I should date this girl. She seemed too good to be true
No_comma_ we are still dating
My new neighbor is pretty cute. Going to talk to her tomorrow.
Thanks a lot! Even if it doesn't_comma_ I would get some practice in.
When I see my wife I am so happy.  She is everything I could ever want in life.
5 years_comma_  And I hope for the rest on my life.
My friends went to an event without me_comma_ but I'm sure they have a good reason to.
Yea_comma_ we do. Does it sound like a bad thing?
I was walking last night and someone started to follow me.
Well_comma_ I started walking much faster. It looked like they were carrying a weapon or something.
I'm going to ask my girlfriend of 10 years to marry me next weekend.

I was scared last weekend when it stormed. I hate thunder
It was that weekend for sure
I went to the grocery store the other day and filled two carts full_comma_ but left with nothing!
Yep it was. My debit card was declined and I still don't know why.
I applied for a job that would allow me to work at home because I suffer from Lupus. I didn't end up getting it so its a bummer.
I've been hunting and have gotten a lot of different ideas from people I asked but either there was nothing in my area or I needed a different qualification.  Its disheartening_comma_ but I'll keep searching.
I know it's August_comma_ but Halloween is so close I can feel it.
Yes. Halloween is my favorite. I do themes with my kids. I don't know what we are doing this year but its time to start shopping.
I a so excited!
My mom is finally coming to America after years of waiting for approval.
Thank you. I really miss her and hope I can take care of her better now.
I work at a soup kitchen and there was this man who comes in every week. I think talking to me is the only contact he ever gets. 
Thank you but it never seems like it's enough. I always want to do more!
 it upset me to see my brother with a brand new car
nah i have kids he doesnt so he can spend crazy and i gotta be a "parent"
My friend said they wanted to talk to me and didn't sound like their usual on the phone.
I don't know. I'm kinda worried.
Feeling great since I have officially finished my Christmas shopping early!
I like to wrap it up early so everything goes smoothly
I start in March every year
I didn't overeat like I usally do. I hope I can always do this
Neither. I just want to stop binge eating.
On Sundays I like to make my granny old recipes for my family.
No. I just like to cook some things the way she did. It reminds me of the time we had together.
I wish my kids had more time with her.
I am teaching my oldest now. Hopefully it will teach her kids too
I was checking the paper this morning_comma_ and I found our that I won $200 on the lottery!
I'm going to buy some new video games that I've been wanting to get for a long time!
I'm so glad I'm able to pay my bills now.
No_comma_ same job actually. They gave me a pay bump!
I was cleaning out my fridge and found some meat that was over a month old. It was green and really gross. 
Yeah I was just lazy in cleaning stuff out_comma_ but I  won't make that mistake again! I don't like to throw up while I'm cleaning. 
I awoke to a hot plate of bacon and eggs this morning.
Scrambled eggs are my favorite.  Especially because I ate them so much in college.
I lied to a friend last week and felt bad. I just did not feel like hanging out
I was tired a bit
Driving to visit my mom yesterday reminded me so much of my childhood
They indeed are! I think of them when I'm having a hard time.
i was saddened when i couldnt get out of work on time
they just dont let you leave if there is too much work left to complete
 I was cleaning out a big closet today and found some Christmas ornaments of my kids feet when they were babies. So small and precious!

I sad with myself when I quit the basketball team. I thought I would do better
I was just lazy and wanted to hang out with my friends instead
I don't like seeing people with lots of money.
Because I don't have any. Its bad but I can't help it.
One day I want to spend freely like that
There is a restaurant that has been around for a while. They're closing down after the wife passed away.
Yea_comma_ I think it would remind them too much of her.
One of my friends wanted me to leave out my other good friend and not tell her about our beach trip we were planning. I told her that I wouldn't go unless we could all go together because I just don't leave people out.
I am fiercely loyal to my friends and don't think anyone should be excluded_comma_ especially among a group of friends that are all going but one person.  Not cool.  
I'm going to meet my long distance girlfriend next weekend!
We met online and are meeting in person for the first time!

My local store stopped carrying my favorite spring rolls.
I think this other place carries it_comma_ but they're pretty far.
I was nervous my first day of college. I did not know anyone
Lots of friends will be nice
I took a walk through my local park and it was great! I realized that my life was pretty great while I was walking!
It really is. I always feel better after taking a walk. 
I sent a 3k check to my cousin. I never sent that much money through the mail before.
I hope they do!
I quit my job last week
They didn't give me a raise and I had been there 4 years. I don't need to work for anyone like that.

i got up to get cereal this morning_comma_ but my roommate drank all my milk. 
Yeah_comma_ most definitely. I used my belt. 
My boyfriend's best friend is a female. 
Yes it really does. He talks to her everyday and tells her everything and even asks for her advice.
I'm going to try out the new Japanese restaurant that just opened up next weekend.
My coworkers rave about the place. I'm psyched to go.
I was confident I was going to pass my drivers test. I studied hard for it
I passed with flying colors
I tried a new restaurant in my neighborhood today
IT was amazing. I couldn't believe such a small place was so good.
Just a salad_comma_ but I tried my boufriends pasta and it was great

I hope not! I went to classes and ate food all while having this paper tail.
A girl hit on me at an event_comma_ but I've got a girlfriend. Not interested.
Yea_comma_ I don't understand people who stray when you've already got a good thing.

Thats true_comma_  I like to think I am a good person.  But I had to take the opportunity to get ahead.

Yeah_comma_ the guy was built like the Incredible Hulk.

When my pet died I felt liek I lost my family member_comma_  My best friend.
I went away on a trip and my mother forgot to feed her.  I was crying so much.
MY sister always borrows money from me.
Sometimes it is a lot and she never pays on time. I eep saying I am going to stop loaning to her but she is my sister.
That is so true.
I once woke up from sleeping to feel paralyzed_comma_  like someone was standing on my chest.
I started to see dark figuers and people fly toward me_comma_  I tried to yell.  then I just blinked and everything was normal and I was awake.
i went into that interview knowing i was going to get the job
yea i prepare for every possible question they can throw at me.. i was the most qualified 
I moved away from my family and friends to start a new job next week. I'm looking forward to it but its so isolating not knowing a single person.
Yes_comma_ I went to a local coffee shop where they were showing a band and tried to mingle but people were very closed off.  I know it takes time so I guess I'll have to be happy with just me myself and I. ha ha.  I haven't started it yet so I hope so!
I once finished a whole bag of candy_comma_ just after startinf my new diet.
I felt terrible.  Like I am going to be fat forever.

I went thrift shopping for the first time today
I found some really cool thing. I think I am going to go again next weekend
I know. Its a win win
I keep a photo of my grandfather in my wallet. It reminds me of him since he passed a few years ago.
He's in a better place now. He used to babysit me a lot when I was a child.
My friends asked me to go out with them_comma_ but I had to decline it because I have to save money for bills.
Thank you. That makes me feel better about my decision.
Someone cut me off in traffic the other day.
Well I thought about honking_comma_ but decided against it and just sat there frustrated.

I was thankful when my Granny gave me money for graduation. It was sweet of her

I don't know why they do it_comma_ I feel the same way as you do.
I know I'm going to get fired tomorrow.
I got an email from a friend at work that knows the boss_comma_ and he said the boss told him I'm toast.  The boss has hated me for years.  Maybe I should call in.

I get nostalgic when I hear Elvis. It reminds me of when I was younger and my dad
He was my dads favorite
I was supposed to be responsible for the powerpoint slides for our presentation_comma_ but I accidentally deleted it.
I explained it to the professor_comma_ but she said we'd get a letter grade deducted from whatever we earn.

I am. I was raised by a music loving family and they picked it up so well
We all pplay piano. My son is learning drums this year and my youngest daughter is taking singing lessons. Maybe they will be a band

I knew I was going to pass my math test. I studied all week
It really does
I had to go to a work conference last week.  I didn't know anyone there_comma_ and I really don't like to travel without my family.  It was hard.
It went fine.  Work conferences are always pretty boring_comma_ but I survived.  Going on vacation with the family next month so I have that to look forward to.
I can't wait for the release of the new Super Smash Brothers game.
Well I hope they will find a good way because I don't want it to be similar to Smash 4.
MY daughter told me she wants toplay bass guitar.
Not yet I had been asking her first years to play the guitar like I did and she said no.
Mom is always right lol
And will be true forever
Last year i got so stuffed last year during thanksgiving that i fell asleep watching football before they even served dessert
Nope i didnt wake up until around midnight but i didnt care i heated up some leftovers and got down on some mac and cheese
Definitely I cant wait for this years thanksgiving 
Definitely a little 420 before the turkey lol get a real appetite going
I really need to get some milk from the store but when I go there I realized I had left my wallet at home. I just walked out with jug and felt so bad about it. 
Yeah but that doesn't make it right. 
I was sad when my team lost last weekend. I really wanted them to win
I did not have fun watching them lose
I just went for my yearly physical and thought everything was good_comma_ but I got a call that the doctor wanted to talk to me about some blood work. Its awful because they aren't open until tomorrow so they haven't gotten back to me yet.
It definitely is stressing me out and I'm trying not to think too far into all the possibilities.  I'll feel sick until I get to talk to them tomorrow.
I've got a wonderful family and can do the things I enjoy. I don't think I can ask for more in life.
Thank you. I don't get why people just want more and more sometimes.
 i trusted my brother the other day and regret it
my dog got out of the gate and ran away
I am scared that I won't like my new neighbors
I haven't seen them. I have never had decent neighbors here. I think I should move
Fingers and toes crossed
I was hoping to go out with my friend's this weekend_comma_ but it was raining all weekend.
I just read a lot but really wanted to do something outdoors. 
I knew my dad was going to pick me up last week. He was a man of his word
Yeah he was very trusting
I'm shocked that my daughter stole alcohol from my locked cabinet and tried to place the bottle with water.
Yeah_comma_ I caught on pretty quick but it's so unlike her to do that.
She lied.
I am kind of sad the summer break is ending
I am ready for them to go back to school_comma_ but we had a lot of fun this summer.
SChool starts tomorrow :(
I've been with my wife for 13 years.
Thank you. She's the love of my life.
I was embarrassed when my zipper was down all day. I did not realize it until I got home
I know_comma_ oh well
My niece can't swim but has is staying with us for a bit and we have a pool.  Her skills are increasing and her confidence is soaring!
Just today and yesterday.  She is 8 and hasn't had access to water as she lives in the mountains.  She has gone from not being able to touch the bottom with her hand to picking up dive sticks and even swimming over the ladder in the deep end.
thanks!  She's super excited!
it was impressive when the lakers signed lebron
me too .. i hope they stomp the warriors
I saw a neighborhood report that someone is breaking into houses and watching people sleep. Creepy! I want to buy a million locks.
I know.  Chills me to the bone.  I wish I could get a dog but I rent and they don't allow.  I am already a light sleeper so this is making me jumpy.  I'm looking into a door jam device. 
My kid's school makes sure all the kids' parents know how to fill out low income forms. There are so many parents who don't know enough English_comma_ and their kids go hungry when they don't have to.
Yes. It's absolutely good! I'm glad the school identified that problem. Many schools don't.
I can't wait for this new video game to come out in November. It will be great to play it but it so far away!
The newest pokemon game "Let's Go Pickachu" A bit nerdy I know but I love the series. 
I stole alcohol from my dad and was caught and decided to lie instead of confessing. I'm ashamed.
Yeah but I don't know if he's ever gonna talk to me again.
I got a new dog recently and have found myself really enjoying taking care of it.
Yes_comma_ I love them too. It's been a while to have one_comma_ so I am very happy now.
My kids have beem gone for days. The house is so quiet.

I can't wait til they come back. Im weird lol
i was scared when i had to walk home alone the other day
yea and we live in a wooded area 
I ordered a pizza today and it was not good.
I asked for no black olives and tehy were everywhere!!!!!
No. They did give me a refund though.
I felt alone last week. All of my friends were out of town
Thanks for the advice
I took $5 out of my 5 year old's birthday stash yesterday.
Yeah_comma_ I bought a $5 lotto ticket.  I was feeling lucky and I really need to scrounge up enough money for rent this month.  We didn't win_comma_ though.
My best friend just told me her husband surprised her for their anniversary and is taking her on a cruise. I am happy for her but I haven't been on a vacation for 5 years so it was painful to hear too.
I hope so.  Most vacations I have planned we ended up cancelling because we didn't have the money.  I'm trying to not dwell on it and find what I'm thankful for but its hard to let go of that feeling.
I was mad when I missed my credit card bill. I felt dumb
I did_comma_ I still felt bad though
I bought a bag of frozen fish last week to cook today.
It had already gone bad when I unthawed it. I was so upset.
I know better now
MY friend just got engaged.
I am but I kind of wish it was me. I know thats bad.
I guess
I was scared last week when it stormed. It made me worry
They are the worst
I had this big meeting at work and it went great. All that hard work before hand really paid off!
I really do try my best to be ready for anything my company asks me to do. 
im a little on the fence if i should ask for time off this week
yea but i should probably save it for later down the road in case one of my kids get sick
My son got straight A's in his summer class. I'm very happy about that.
Right! And they aren't too excited to go to them usually.
I buy things that my kids don't like so I don't have to share.
Seafood_comma_ hot snacks_comma_ diet sodas. Its bad I know
You are a cool person then lol
I felt bad last week when I was caught in a lie. I felt like a rat
About where I was and who I was with
I am such a sap.
I keep everything my kids make for me. I am running out of room
MY house looks like a kindergarten classroom lol
I recently adopted a dog and have been enjoying taking care of it.
They sure can. I think it's exactly what I needed at this time.
It is a puppy pretty much (around one year old).
I used my skills to pick the winning numbers in the lottery today. I feel pretty good about myself.
They gave it to me right there at the 7-11.  I didn't win the big one_comma_ just my dollar back_comma_ but it's better than I normally do!
I think my life is pretty good right now.
I hope it lasts. Everything is just falling into place.
Thanks. I widh this feeling for everyone
i was scared to walk home the other day
we live on a big plot of wooded land
I was envious last week when my friend got a new car. It makes me want one
Not just yet
My friend has this habit of getting too drunk and losing her mind on every vacation we go on. I'm thinking about canceling the one we have planned in a few weeks.
Maybe but it will turn into a fight
I made a cake for a party and didn't end up going. I had a slice and then another and another until I ate the whole thing. I didn't tell anyone._comma_ til now.
ha ha.  It was amazing!  I really didn't feel sick because I hadn't eaten lunch or dinner with how busy the day was.  It is so sinfully rich though. Double layered with icing in the middle. 
I can't believe my landloard still hasnt fixed my stove
Yes. It has been a week. We couldnt male our homemade pizzas like we do every saturday.
That sounds like a plan
My friend to me I'm dumb and really bad at my job. I'm so upset with him!
Well I was telling him about my job and he sad that I was to stupid to do my job right.
i like to exercise 5 days a week_comma_ and eat super clean on weekends i have 2 cheat days_comma_ im feel disapointed in myself sometimes when i go over _comma_and have 3 cheat days
yeah i know _comma_ and thank you i just sometimes have little decipline 
I heard something under my bed last night and freaked out.
It was a dog that my wife was going to surprise me with for my birthday today.  It had gotten out of its crate she was keeping it in and hid under the bed.
i was happy when i got promoted a few months back
yea i got an 8% raise.. thank you.. it was a long time coming
I have been single two years now.
I am beginning to feel alone now. Thats no fun
I have but never got a second date. Dating is so different now.
I hope so. I guess I shouldnt rush
i  was scared to go home the other day
live in a dark wooded area
I was hurt and saddened when my aunt passed away. No one expected it
She had a heart attack in her sleep
My mom cheated on my dad!! How could she??
I hate it too. I never want to speak to or see her again!
I was shocked when my brother bought me a vacation package. It was a nice gesture
He had the money for it I guess
I went through allof m FB photo albums today
I was really looking at my kids pictures and how they have grown so. I could have cried lol
Three they are in school now so its bittersweet
It was awful. I had a piano solo with a band that I joined and we play all over the place. Anyway_comma_ I bombed it and forgot a section so skipped forward and fumbled with the notes. Crushing.
I don't know.  I don't want to be remembered as the person who ruined the band and I think my band mates are a bit ashamed of me.
One night_comma_ I was abducted by aliens. They probed me and I'm afriad they will come back. 
It's because I've been watching the stars since I was young. 
I promised my daughter I would watch IT wih her tonight.
I am too scared though. I don't like horror films at all
I promised so I hope I can do it 
I have a test at work tomorrow to see if I can get a promotion.
I have never felt better about my chances than I do now.  I've failed a few times_comma_ but I'm ready!
i cant wait for thanksgiving all the food around me _comma_ and see all my family pigging out makes me so happy and thankful for everything in life
thankfully they all come to me _comma_ and the majority lives around the same area _comma_ except my older brother that lives in germany and my baby brother that lives in new york
I was mad when my brother canceled plans tonight. I was looking forward to hanging out
Not yet_comma_ I hope we do
My friend just got back with her ex AGAIN
I don't know. She knows he is no good. He will just hurt her again because she allows it. Its sad.
I heard a person tv tonight that was impressive. He made me want to save money
Ha_comma_ it absolutely was
I lost my ipad the othe day
No I think it was stolen. We went to the park and i dont know what happened.
IT does. I am wondering if it will turn up. Trying to be optimistic
A kid I went to school with is in jail for harming a puppy_comma_ what a vile human!
It really is_comma_ what possesses someone to do that?
I was super nervous about the day today as a semi family member has been acting up and I didn't want them to ruin anyones day.
They did unfortunately. I'll just never understand people who like to make everyone else miserable just because they are.
Sorry they DIDN'T. I know right! Always walking on eggshells! I'll never get it! Just be in peace or behave. One of the two
I wish I could sit around and eat and sleep all day like my cat.
I so wish I could be a cat... ohhh how easy life would be!
I live by myself. My apartment seems really empty some time. 
That's really intersting? Maybe you need a cat to help?
My friend bought me dinner tonight. I was very thankful
It was steak
I had to take my car to the mechanic the other day.  I don't know anything bout cars_comma_ but I know my guy is honest.
Yeah_comma_ it's hard to know who to trust_comma_ but I've known this guy for years_comma_ so I know I can count on him.
My daughter showed me a poem she wrote earlier today
IT was about going back to school. She had average grades in English last year. I was surprised it was so good.
She is almost 14. 
I was pretty upset tonight. My friend canceled plans on me
None that they told me
MY son just wasted my soda on some important papers.
I have to turn them into the school tomorrow. Now I will be late for work because I have to do new ones at the school in the morning.
I hate being late but I have to get the papers in
I was happy when my friend invited me over tonight. It had been awhile
It was a good time too
I recently got a job with better pay. I'm stoked to see my first paycheck.
Oh yeah! And I don't have to work many more hours_comma_ which to me is the best part.
i went to my friend's birthday party a few weeks ago 
i did. i was looking forward to it all week_comma_ and it met my expectations.
My daughter got straight As all year long! She worked so hard!
Does she try at all?
I'm turning 35 next year. I can't wait
Is it? lol. I plan to go on a cruise with my close friends. Hopefully they don't flake.
It will be whether they show up or not
So I was coming home last night kinda late and It was really dark outside my house.. 
well what happened is i was putting my key in the door and this duck scared me half to death
I read this amazing book. The author is so smart!
It's about black holes!
I was just diagnosed with breast cancer_comma_ just at its first stage_comma_ and I don't even know how to feel or what to do. Its terrifying.
I have a wonderful family and a couple close friends that have been with me through my other illnesses so I know they're be with me through this.  I wish I had gone plant based sooner because dairy is linked with very high risk of breast cancer.
Thank you. no_comma_ I haven't heard of him/her.  I am reading a lot of Dr. Joel Furhman's books. I will look into it.  Thank you so much!
My out-of-town relatives are visiting_comma_ and there was on relative whom I really enjoy speaking with_comma_ that I didn't get to hang out with much while they were here. I won't get to seem them for a while_comma_ so it kind of stinks we didn't make the most of our time this weekend
Yeah_comma_ that's true. I'm hoping we can maintain our friendship despite the distance. At least with social media and what not_comma_ that kind of becomes easier. But I'm worried about us growing apart in terms of personalities.
I knew I was going to get this job. I was prepared for it
Its in production
I was hiking the other day and I ran across a dead deer with maggots eating on it. It smelled so bad!
I actually had to hold my nose and run off. Almost ruined my hike.
I took care of my sick cat over the weekend. I just had to care for him as much as I could
He is as of now
The entire last month I was getting ready for a trip around the world. Takes a lot of planning!
Yup. Now that I'm finally ready_comma_ I'll be taking off in about a week. 
Looking at pictures of a recent vacation I took with my girlfriend to the Colorado Mountains. It stinks because we're long distance_comma_ so not only do I have to be sad about the vacation being over_comma_ but also sad about being far apart again. But at least seeing the pictures brings back great memories
We will eventually. But I'm in school right now_comma_ and she has a good job_comma_ so neither of us are able to move_comma_ and haven't been able to for a few years. We'll get there eventually though.
I had excargot over the summer on a cruise
Everyone else was trying it so I did too. It was terrible but I can now say I did it
My daughter will be in high school next year
I don't. She is a young woman now and its too much for me lol
I am going to cry now lol
Someone just stole my car.
No_comma_ I was asleep.  I have never been so mad in my life.  The police say I should just expect to never see it again.
I have really gotten into that show Power.
I don't usually like shows like that_comma_ but the writing is so good. I watch it every Sunday
Drugs. That's why I was apprehensive
I'm taking care of my two nephews this weekend while their parents are out of town_comma_ and it's nice to see how the older one takes care of the younger one_comma_ despite them just being 7 and 2_comma_ respectively. It's awesome to see brothers caring for each other for a change_comma_ and it made me feel good about them.
They can be a handful. They're not the most socialized_comma_ so especially when we have other children over_comma_ they don't quite interact well_comma_ and they easily misunderstand situations. But I do appreciate the brotherly bond they have. It's something to be envious of.
I had to cancel on my friend tonight. I felt bad when I did too
I hope I can too
My girlfriend and I had an argument this afternoon_comma_ while she's about to go away to see relatives for a week. It's kind of a bummer because we don't really communicate that well_comma_ especially when it comes to arguments. It usually devolves into us rather not talking instead of trying to fully speak out our issues.
Yeah_comma_ which is fine if we were just friends_comma_ but we're significant others and we plan to get married_comma_ so it's kind of worrisome that after years being together that we're not better at communicating_comma_ or at least working through an argument. It's hard for us to put aside our personal feelings and be objective_comma_ but only when it's with one another_comma_ for some reason.
I could not wait for last weekend to get here. We were going to see some new breweries 
I love a good saison
Pretty envious that my friend can go out and buy a new car with the snap of a finger.
An old beat up car that I need to replace but can't afford to.
Ahhhh I wish I was 18 again.. Things were so different back then..
well i had my parents back then.. and sodas were only a quarter.
Candy bars.. 25 cents too.  Cigarettes.. 75 cents
My son passed his exams at school with good grade. I am so proud of him
Yes_comma_ he is smart and a hard working boy.
I moved to a different state for my husband's job and left the rest of my family behind.
I'm doing okay. It was for a good reason_comma_ his new job is so much better. But it can get lonely
I moved away from my home town last year for a new job. I sort of regret it since I don't have many people to talk to.
I have. I'm pretty introverted so it's hard for me to meet new people. I'm considering a move back.
I wasn't able to go to California for a family reunion and a friend of mine paid for tickets for my husband and me! I haven't seen my family in years and she made my year_comma_ my century! 
It was amazing!  I was there a whole week.  She got a bonus from work and wanted me to have it.  I have never had anyone do anything like that for me before!
I went into the bathroom at work today and someone had clogged it.
It was more than that_comma_ it was horrifying.  I have never seen anything more disturbing in my life.  The toilet was overflowing onto the floor.
I'm really optomistic about climate change. I think wed really can solve this crucial issue. 
Yeah I recycle. 
I knew my dad would pull through when he had the flu in a bad way. I just had faith
Yeah_comma_ it was scary but good in the end
I saw an ad for Disneyland and I remembered the first time I had ever been there
Splash Mountain_comma_ of course :D I was maybe 9 or 10_comma_ and I've only been once
I was shocked in a good way when my aunt made my graduation. She lived out of state
It was in english
Somehow a LEGO got stuck under my front-door to my house_comma_ and now it helped to crack the frame of the door_comma_ and it needs to be replaced. What's worse is I had just gotten done telling my child that they need to make sure they're more responsible with their toys_comma_ and to put them in their appropriate places. I'm trying to be patient and not overreact in the situation_comma_ but it's hard.
Yeah_comma_ it's hard_comma_ since I feel like what I'm trying to communicate to them isn't getting through. They repeat the same thing a dozen times_comma_and then maybe they start making some progress. It's hard for me to see them run into the same wall over and over_comma_ so to speak. But you're right.
I've been having car trouble lately_comma_ but my brother in law has been helping me get around. I'm so thankful towards him./
I wouldn't know where to turn if he hadn't offered to help. I hope I don't burden him for too long though.
My mom lost her battle with cancer_comma_ I was prepared for it but it still hurts so bad.
It is_comma_ I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.
I stole money from my mom's purse. I'm so ashamed. 
Yeah she caught me and yelled at me. 
I am waiting to see if I got that new job I applied for
Absolutely! I have faith_comma_ but you never really know until it's all done
I have been struggling with a flare up from my Rheumatoid Arthritis after I had such a long period of feeling good. Its depressing to be in bed all day and fail your family in what you need to be doing.
Thank you. Yes_comma_ chronic illness can be really hard.  I try to stay positive because I know it makes a different on my health to stay optimistic.  But this flare came suddenly and its horrible to be back in bed.
I was pretty nervous starting my new job. I was not sure what to expect
Its in production
At a office party_comma_ I tried to invite a female coworker for a drink. She rejected me in front of everybody. I felt bad.
She has been mean and making sure that everyone knows. That is the thing.
I was in line getting fast food today_comma_ and the person in front of me paid for my meal! I offered to do the same for the person behind me_comma_ even though I always think that's cheesy when I hear about it. But it was still kind of a cool event that happened_comma_ as I'm sure it carried on a while.
Yeah_comma_ it was. Of course_comma_ I was just one person he paid for_comma_ and I ended up paying for three.. so I lost out a little bit. But I try not to be cynical about it. It's still a cool thing that happens.
I was a lonesome weekend. All of my friends were busy
I guess_comma_ I got through it
I can feel a cold sore coming on on my lip! Quite a frustrating thing before a big job interview I have!
They take forever to go away!
I lied to my friend today and told him I was too busy to hang out because I just wanted to be alone. I do feel sort of bad.
I agree with you_comma_ but I can't help it. Maybe I should have just been honest with her.
my friend got a new job recently _comma_ a 2nd job if i may add and im really happy for him
yes he will be busy _comma_ but his life will also be better _comma_ im just over all really happy for him
I was a little unsure going to a movie alone tonight. It did not feel right
Yeah it wasnt so bad
Getting on a flight in a couple of days. Kind of nervous because I've never flown before_comma_ and I just have a weird feeling about it. Like_comma_ I know it will be fine_comma_ but I'm worried about the safety of plans_comma_ I'm worried about getting lost_comma_ I'm worried about being far from home.. Just a little overwhelming.
I'm going to North Carolina to start my first semester of college! So_comma_ that's a part of it_comma_ too_comma_ is I'm going to a completely new place_comma_ away from family_comma_ and doing it in a way I haven't done before that kind of wracks my nerves.
i was excited when i got to leave work early
no i was not i was able to go home and wait for the family the we went out to eat
It must be nice for people to go on exotic vacations every time they turn around.
Where would you go first?
I was happy with myself tonight. I ate really healthy
Yeah it really is
I thought I heard an animal trapped under my house last night.
I think it might have been something large. There was a lot of noise and scratching.
It could be! Sometimes what I imagine it to be is worse than what it is in reality.
I have been told that I am too gullible. One time someone told me they were a celebrity and I believed them.
They said they knew the Kardashians and have a helicopter. I guess I need to be more skeptical.
The company that I working for is having financials issues. I am happy that I wasn't part of the recent lay off.
Yes_comma_ that was the hard part of it. I saw some of my coworker escorted by security. It is a sad thing to see.
I'm jealous of my co-worker_comma_ who seems to be in such good shape and able to have the willpower and patience to work out so much_comma_ and eat a healthy diet_comma_ while doing the same workload as me. I would love to look like he does_comma_ but I just don't have the patience. I wonder what his secret to success would be_comma_ if I asked
Yeah_comma_ I know you're right. I believe you. The hardest thing is the dieting. I just have no interesting in most of the diet strategies_comma_ and it's hard to be on a diet and stay social. Every time I go to a party or out with friends_comma_ it doesn't allow for me to be very healthy. Something I'll have too figure out.
My dog managed to slip out the door yesterday and ended up going straight for the road and got ran over. I feel so horrible.
It's going to be hard_comma_ and I don't think I'll be able to have another dog anytime soon. It'll take a while before I'm comfortable enough_comma_.
My friend randomly gave me a gift out of nowhere!
He gave me a $100 gift card!
Took my son to ER because he had a sore throat.  They misdiagnosed it and it got worse.
Well_comma_ after a few days of getting worse_comma_ took him to his primary dr.  He gave antibiotics for a sore throat.
Nope.  Got worse_comma_ went to an ENT and finally got the correct antibiotics.  ER bill_comma_ Dr. bill and ENT bill for what started as a simple sore throat.
I plan to buy a home soon_comma_ and will be moving.  I'm really anticipating having to pack everything up and what a new house will feel like.
I think our current house is problematic enough that all the effort and anxious feelings will be worth it.
I have a friend who's been weight lifting with me for years now and he looks better than me. I wish I had his genetics!
It sure is frustrating_comma_ but I can't say I haven't made great progress myself. But his progress is insane!
I miss the times when me and my cousins were going to the beach when we were young.
It bring back always good memories.It was nice. Nothing to worry about. Just playing.
We were at a family gathering_comma_ and my relatives were in town for the weekend and we were saying our final goodbyes before they headed back home. My nephew stood up in front of everyone and farted. He's 11... He should be able to know better. I cringed.
No. His parents weren't there to hear it or witness it. I didn't feel like ratting him out or dealing with it_comma_ either. Kind of lazy on my part. Everyone just kind of shrugged it off and laughed awkwardly_comma_ but you could tell everyone was thinking_comma_ "Really? Why?"
My child said his first word the other day! It wasn't mama or da-da_comma_ but at least he's making progress! His first word was "one." Not the most meaningful or memorable_comma_ but I'm just proud of him anyway.
Yeah. I didn't want to sit there and video tape and just be lost in my phone and behind a screen while he did it_comma_ especially because I wanted him to see my face clearly and all that. But I do kind of wish I had it so I could play it back over and over again. I wish we had a recorder in our eyes somehow!
I'm really said. I'm missing my youthful vigor. 
Yeah_comma_ I just don't have the energy I need to do things I want to. 
Why? What's going on on Friday?
I am leaving for vacation! I can't wait!
For my last birthday I told my husband I didn't want a gift but he got me a laptop... I was very happy!
I'm not sure_comma_ I dont know much. IT's a LEnovo but he says it can handle video games and everything so Im excited
I went to a minor league ball game last night and I saw a pitcher throw over 101 miles per hour!  It was amazing to see in real life
The way he was was pitching last night_comma_ it might be soon
Someone slammed into my car and totaled it while it was parked. I am so mad because I didn't have insurance on it yet since I just bought it. The worst timing ever!
Thanks.  Yeah_comma_ I'm trying to figure out what kind of coverage I have if I just purchased it.  It might have still been on the other persons insurance.  I had to take off work and am losing money all around.  
My parents came and visited me from out of town. It was so great to see them again_comma_ and they brought so much energy back into my small crummy apartment and isolated life. But now they've gone back home and it's back to an empty room and not having anyone to talk to.
Yeah_comma_ that's true. Absence makes the heart grow fonder--that's the truest statement ever spoken. I'm one of the lucky ones who has good parents that I wish I could be around all the time. They're funny_comma_ they don't nag_comma_ they're supportive and encouraging_comma_ and always insightful.
It's the middle of the night and someone is banging on my garage door!
No_comma_ I can't see anything and I'm too scared to look out a window!
I was watching a friend of my show of his juggling skills recently. I got to say_comma_ I was quite dazzled by his skills!
He was able to juggle 5 bean bags for about a minute and a half.  I had no idea he was that coordinated.
I once was traveling at a speed in excess of the speed limit.  A police officer was waiting just off the side of the road beyond the hill I had just cross_comma_ and I immediately knew he had me.
What is interesting is that I was certain he had caught me_comma_ but what I didn't realize was that one travelling behind me on the interstate must have been going faster than I was.
I did pull over_comma_ and the police officer ended up behind the two of us.  He told me to move along.  Lucky day_comma_ ... indeed. 
When I baked Christmas cookies last year I meant to bring some to my neighbors. But I had to eat a few first.
Well a few turned into a few more and before I knew it there were none left to share. I felt so bad. Next Christmas I will make up for it.
I was able to achieve my diet goals finally. It has been one year that I am on diet.
I wanted to loose weight. I proud of myself to have finally acheived my goals.
Yesterday I was doing shores outside and was just finishing up when a lizard jumped on me out of nowhere!
No.  They are really harmless_comma_ but I just wasn't expecting it at all!  It made my heart skip a beat!
i was mad when i returned to my car and noticed someone put a dent in my car
no i didnt find them.. sucks that people dont care about other peoples property
Im really happy about how my life is going and i cannot wait for the future.
I appreciate your kind words_comma_ and I hope everything goes your in the future too.
I cooked for family last week and it tasted pretty bad. I know they noticed_comma_ but they didn't say anything.
I can tell they were just being polite too. I let myself down. I'll have to focus more next time.
I am really looking forward to the next Avatar movie. It seems like I have been waiting forever.
It is going to be a trilogy with possibly another trilogy after that. James Cameron has been very busy!
I have been high nutrient vegan for 3 months now and got on the scale today only to discover that I have lost 34 pounds! I was shocked!
I haven't been weighing myself because its about health and longevity but I needed to lose weight and I figured that would just be a byproduct of healthy eating.
Tomorrow_comma_ I am doing a presentation to my CEO. I am sure that I will give a good impression.
To the CEO of the company_comma_ no_comma_ I didn't. I feel confident.
Did you know Double Dare came back? My favorite show of the 90s! I feel like a kid again.
It's such a great show and still just as good today!
The other night I was watching this documentary about a puppy mill getting busted and the dogs getting rescued.  I wanted to adopt everyone of them
Really?   We actually have a lot of rescue places in my town.  They do not take kindly to people abusing animals in my neck of the woods.
i was scared when i saw that owl staring at me
yea he was very creepy
I found an old box of photos today. It was so nice looking through photos of my childhood. I'm glad my parents capture those moments
Yes they recently gave me a lot of them
I got a raise lately and didn't expect a raise this big!
It was unexpected_comma_ so it was even better!
My cubicle neighbor at work really bothers me. He eats all day long and is always chewing loud foods with his mouth open! I can barely think with him chomping like a cow!
I could go to HR_comma_ but I don't want to be "that guy" if you know what I mean.
Starting to get better at jogging. Last summer I could only jog a couple of miles. Now I'm working up past 5 miles_comma_ to 7 and 8 miles each time I go out. I need to get a lot better with my mile times_comma_ but I'm starting to get interested in the idea of a half marathon.
Yeah_comma_ I am. I mostly just do it so I can eat as many cheeseburgers as I want and not get too fat. But now that it's a little bit more of a realistic possibility to do something like that as an achievement_comma_ it's become a little interesting.
one time i got to work and my manager said where have you been _comma_ i didnt think much of it i said in bed relaxing _comma_ shes like your late 3 hours i guess i wrote my squedule wrong_comma_ it felt so bad
my manager laughed and said dangit man get to work _comma_ lol thanks for your input it made me smile
Was grocery shopping_comma_ and saw my old best fried in the dairy aisle. Haven't spoken to them in like ten years_comma_ even though we used to be really close. We caught up a little bit_comma_ and exchanged numbers to talk more later. Funny how small the world is sometimes.
That's actually a really good point.. I do online gaming_comma_ so I have tons of online friends_comma_ almost all of which I'm sure I'll never meet. And I definitely have lost touch with most of them_comma_ just because it's so easy to. I don't really do social media either_comma_ so I don't have that to kind of glue things together. Wonder why it's hard for adults to keep friends
Really appreciate your perspective. That's awesome. Online friends are every bit as good. I'm with you there. Hope things stay good with yoou
My boss just informed me that I will be getting a bunch of unfinished work from a coworker that was promoted. I am so mad that I have to do my stuff and someone elses incomplete work! 
I would_comma_ but my boss has too much control over how much our bonuses are.  I will just have to scream in a pillow and suck it up.
I can't wait for the next season of Stranger Things to get released. I want to see how eleven uses her powers.
Yeah I don't want to wait that long. It is going to be so hard for me.
i was happy when i saw lebron james go to the lakers
yea i hope they can do some damage
I am going zip-lining in Colorado in a week. There is only one problem I am really scared of heights!
If not for my wife pushing me to do it_comma_ I don't think I could be brave enough!
This morning I found a garden snake in my yard! It wasn't very big but I don't like snakes.
Really? I would probably run the other way lol
I've been putting off buying a computer part that I needed and just noticed it went up 10%! I'm pretty mad at myself.
I hope so too! I might have to just end up buying it. My hard drive is getting pretty old and running slow.
So_comma_ it is more than a month past the 4th of July.  My neighbors are still shooting off fireworks at night.  I am not happy.
I mean_comma_ a few days before and after is fine_comma_ but a whole month.  That is pretty inconsiderate of your neighbors
I miss the old days when life was simple. There were no cell phones or Internet. People had to talk to each other.
Life was what you made out of it. I guess we will never go back to the way things were.
i was impressed when a friend of mine got a job 2 days after telling me he wanted to quit
yea i dont know about that but he usually gets what he wants
I'm having a baby in 3 weeks..... the waiting is makjing anxious!
a girl... time is going fast but slow at the same time
No second_comma_ I have another girl :)
Thanks!
So a few years ago_comma_ my best friend who lives in NYC  surprised me by flying down to spend New Year's Eve with me in my city. I had no idea!
Yeah it was so cool! She and my husband secretly coordinated it. 
Yeah I'm pretty lucky :)
i was upset when i was told i couldnt go home on time
because there was still too much work left to do
I am going to visit my friend in France next month.
No. I usually go once or twice a year_comma_ but it has been awhile this time_comma_ so I am so happy!
I just started a month long class for work in a town that I have never been. I feel so isolated in my hotel by myself.
They are all a lot older than me.  I would feel out of place.  I just wish there was someone my age I could hang out with.
Once I put my shirt on inside out by accident. I didn't realize it until someone told me at school.
No I'm not that hip. I felt kind of dumb and made some excuse about being in a hurry.
I opened an old box of my grandfathers possessions that I was given after he passed away and found his watch that he always wore. I became really nostalgic and thought of all the good times I had with him.
Yeah_comma_ it make me smile and appreciate the time I did have with him.
One the way to work_comma_ I got a flat tire and I missed a very important presentation.  I was pretty upset.
No_comma_ he understood_comma_ but I missed a really good presentation.  I was not happy.
i was happy to see that my vacation time was approved at work
yea we are going to disney world!
My cat is very sick.
She is very old. We are probably going to have to put her down this week.
i was upset when i saw someone had dented my car door
no i was at the store for a few hours so i wasnt able to catch the person
I am tired of feeling like I have to compete for my boyfriend's attention.
He pays more attention to his friends than me.
My pet ferret Fuzzy died the other day. I was so heart-broken.
He was climbing in his cage and fell down and bopped his head on his water feeder. Knocked him right out. I'm going to cry again :(.
My cat of 15 years passed away today...
I have no idea why it's happening all at once_comma_ but I had that cat for a good long while. He was such a great cat.
I sure do hope so too. I bet they're best buds just playin' around in the afterlife.
One day I walked out front door and there was a coral snake laying there. I jumped and ran back inside
Me either! Not at all!
They all creep me out!
I'm pregnant but wasn't able to have a baby shower but all my friends and family sent us nice little gifts.... It was such a nice thing of them to do
I moved to a different state and wasn't able to make it back to my home state :( but it was nice
I accidentally spilled my coffee on my date a few days ago
Sadly no. Or_comma_ at least not yet. She hasn't exactly been eager to respond. Poor me
I just moved to a new city for my job.
I don't know anyone here and there's nothing to do.
Someone let my dog out while I was at work! I can't believe it!
I have no idea! I came home and my backyard gate was open. I can't find him anywhere. 
It is sad_comma_ but I'm also feeling the complete opposite of sad! I miss him so much.
I am done looking for love. I keep getting rejected over and over again.
Well unless it falls on my lap I will be by myself for the time being. Guess I better get used to me_comma_ myself_comma_ and I.
Recently my 18 month old has started repeating words so much more clearly.... makes me so happy!
I might regret being so happy right now when she's talking non stop lol
I have done my grocery yesterday. I didn't pay for a chocolate bar. I feel bad about it.
I didn't eat yet but I can't return it. 
There was this one time when my family was on a roadtrip and we got lost in the middle of no where at night.
Yeah_comma_ it was pretty frightening. But we eventually found a small city.
We just tried to follow an intersate highway until we found something. We felt pretty lucky when we did.
So I just saw I got a high score on my last test despite not studying enough (or so I thought).
Thank you_comma_ I hope that's it... Or maybe just lucky this time. haha
I received my first check from my first job yesterday. I am happy. I am finally financially independent.
Yes_comma_ I am planning to save money to buy a car.
There was a similar situation when I was trying to catch a softball and ran smack dab into a fence.
It did indeed. For the next few weeks I was too scared to even try and catch another ball. 
I was going to go to a work picnic today_comma_ but it didn't happen thanks to rain.
Yes_comma_ we will try again next week. I was mad about it but now I feel okay.
I've been seeing someone on line for over 2 decades.  I finally got the chance to meet them in person and took a 29 hour bus ride to another part of the US to finally meet them.
I live with her now.  In fact she's sitting right next to me this very moment.
Thank you.  I am also greatful to have found my person :D
So I found out twice that I was pregnant with a daughter_comma_ so I have two little girls now. Different ages of course. I am getting all worked up hoping my next one will be a boy!
Ultrasound and an old tale that if the heart rate was above 160 it was definitely a girl lol
awe whats their names? Both my girls have two middle names but first names are AvaLea pronounced AvaLee and my second is Myah :P
Awe :) I like the name Archer for a boy ^_^. But here is the kicker! My eldest daughter was born September 27 and my youngest was born September 28 xD
Next week my brother is paying me a visit. I am quite excited as I have not seen him in a while.
We will have a good time together. He is bringing his fiancee with him who I have not met yet.
I have a big exam coming up next week_comma_ and yet I feel totally prepared for it.
Thank you. I studied quite hard and think that I will do well_comma_ regardless of what questions are on it.
My roommate moved out a month ago and decided to travel across the country living out of his SUV that he outfitted into a bedroom.
Believe it or not_comma_ he was well prepared. I consider it a glorified move to California_comma_ but he seems happy!
i come from a large mexican family my little niece just speaks spanish_comma_ she just starte kinder and with a few months already she was speaking english sure its sounds broken but i was still astonished
maybe little kids just learn faster _comma_ she gets home and starts counting and saying the a_comma_ b _comma_cs in english 
I studied really hard for my exam_comma_ and I think I'll do well!
It's actually a Master's exam so it covers a lot of material_comma_ but I do feel I learned it well and am confident in my abilities
So when I was in grade 12_comma_ my friends and I competed in school math contest. I still was not feeling so confident because I was having a hard time fitting in the school. But that day I solved 4 out of 5 questions given during the contest and my team won. And from that day on until I finished the school I felt a little more recognized and quite a bit more confident. 
Yes I did! 
Ah well_comma_ I'm sure you were good at other things. I was glad I was at least good at that. I didn't find myself too interesting so I had a very hard time fitting in so that was the only thing I was able to be proud of at that time =) 
I was feeling rather anxious the other day because I smoked a ton of pot
No I was home alone. I kept on fearing that I would get caught if someone came home
I am fat. I feel ashame when I have to change clothes in the men locker room.
I am trying but I never reach my goals.
My boyfriend surprised me with flowers today.
You should totally do it! You will earn a lot of brownie points.
My roommate just passed his driving license test. I was not expecting him to pass it the first time he takes it. But he did it
Now he is planning on getting his own car. He is now all over craigslist searching for used cars
The situation was very unfair and I was treated as if I didn't matter after working there for over 5 years
I know.  I worked my tail off for that company.  After I was fired they called me a week later to tell me they realized it wasn't my fault but I had already found a new job and told them to take a hike.
I ordered a gift for a friend and it says it was delivered but I never received it. Now the company says it takes 14 days for a refund
Still waiting..... That's the most upsetting. Because they waste no time taking your money
I wish I could live in 60's. It seems that during that period life was easier.
Finding a job is tougher. Life is more expensive.
I love Marvel and DC_comma_ but i'm not so sure I should join the Comic Book Club at school.
What if people think I'm a nerd? This will be my first year at a new school.
That's very true. I could do that! Thanks for the advice.
I wab blessed enough to be able to see two of my daughters graduate from high school. I couldn't be more happy for them.
I sure am! They are so excited to be starting a great new chapter in their lives.
A little bit of both. One really likes Journalism while the other favors engineering and computer science_comma_ but they do tell me they are stressed about starting.
I was looking at pictures of when I got engaged and can't believe how time has flown by_comma_ 14 years later.
It does!  I was so young! My favorite moment was when he was acting nervous and talking on and on and I had no idea what was happening_comma_ right before he proposed...it was so cute.
My exams are coming up soon and will be studying a lot for them. I would like get a good grade.
Honestly_comma_ it all comes down to how well I control my procrastination_comma_ but I should be able to focus.
Hello
So this system asked me to describe a situation. A few years ago I was outside with some friends and some gang members pulled up with guns. This was not a fun situation...
I'm looking forward to going to Colorado for my new sister-in-law's wedding reception! ^_^
I myself haven't been there in 11 years! I'm looking forward to seeing it again.
Thanks so much! I hope I will too! ^_^
I was driving my car all day and really needed the gas money
Yes I got the 40.00 tip from a customer 
I was at the mall and when I got back to my car_comma_ it wouldn't start. I know nothing about cars and didn't know what to do besides calling my husband. Thankfully he was able to figure it out
yes that was the problem... he came and brought a new one. thankfully it wasn't anything major
I'm turning 21 in three days!
Thanks_comma_ we're having a huge party.  I can't wait.
There will be around 100 people and we're going to Las Vegas!
I live in Canada_comma_ but I like a Nigerian man
I know_comma_ but I had been talking to him since March 2017_comma_ It is already July 2018. 
No yet. But I am planning to visit him and marry him. It sounds crazy_comma_ I know. But I am in love.
I had a rough time in the hospital back in march of last year. I got pretty sick and was stuck in there for a week.
It was weird and out of the blue. I developed appendicitis and diverticulitis at the same time. My bowels tried to kill me. Just very painful mostly and I had surgery.
I appreciate that. Everything was fine...they just removed my appendix and literally scrubber my intestines clean but I made it out alright.
My partner decided to visit her parents for a week who live out of city. Now i do not have anybody to talk to and feel lonely
Maybe_comma_ but i need emotional attachment to someone i am talking and that i cannot take from you unfortunately
I had an unexpected emergency pop up and I couldn't make it in to cover him.I felt really bad for not being able to cover him.
Yeah he was really frustrated with me. I really hope he forgives me_comma_ and lets me make it up to him.
Today I went to the beach with my family and it reminded me of building castles in the sand as a kid.
It does_comma_ I really reconnecting with my past as it makes me appreciate it more.
I love to play a lot of Mario kart and I am very confident in my skills
I play on the Switch version of Mario Kart 8
I think that you will enjoy it plenty of games to choose from
My parents surprised me with a trip up to see me for 4 days. I was so shocked and am so happy they are here!
My parents are in another country so I haven't seen them for about 3 years.  I wish I had money to go visit them.  Yeah_comma_ its a pity that I still have to work too but I got to enjoy them this weekend!
I was watching a horror movie with my friends and I got really scared
I'm a huge scaredy-cat. I just can't take them since they give me nightmares. Ugh. 
There was this one time that a really rude customer yelled at my workplace. I was really not having it.
I just tried to remain calm and and took it. What would you have done in that situation if you had the chance?
I just broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years. She left the apartment to me. I'm all by myself. 
No_comma_ I don't like being the only one here. There's so much space here for one person.
I do_comma_ as well. One day_comma_ but for now I guess I have to learn to live by myself
One time I bought a five dollar lottery ticket. i didn't expect to win anything but I ended up winning five hundred dollars.
I was really excited. It was nice to win that much money and then I went shopping at the mall.
I bought some clothes and a new TV
seeing your love one dying frightened me. I cant control myself to think about it.
well_comma_ for one I am not prepared and for two this is the first time I felt this.  
I fell for my ex again. He knows how to get to me.
To stop gambling and give me his entire check. How could I say no? I know its not going to last though.
We will see.
I can't wait for the next Star Wars movie to come out. I love Star Wars more than anything!
It's cool. It's not for everyone. I'm a nerd at heard so I love science fiction.
Game of thrones is about to end. I can't believe they are going to do this to me!
I know. I almost went outside this summer. Instead I just rewatched the series.
Its nothing fancy. You're not missing anything lol
I cared for my grandfather the last months of his life_comma_ I really enjoyed taking care of him
Yeah_comma_ time is the only thing that matters_comma_ and i'm glad he left happy
I spoke with numerous active and reserve personnel about their basic training experiences.  There wasn't much positive in what they shared so my mind wallowed in what lay ahead.  Naturally I was worried to say the least.
These were the experiences I had before I went into basic training. 
I am about to start college at the end of the month.
I don't. I'm going far away from home and I don't know anyone
I am from Tennessee and moving to Oregon. 
My mom says she will but I think I'm going to transfer after a year. Its too far. 
My daughter is graduating from medical school this month.
Yeah_comma_ she is my little pride and joy_comma_ although she's not so little anymore.
An internist.  She has a little ways to go yet with her residency.
When I was little my grandma gave me a little ceramic cat.
I am not sure_comma_ just a little black and white one. I still keep it on display in my room because it reminds me of her.
So I just bought plane tickets and book a hotel.  I am going to Vegas for the first time this fall!
I will avoid the passing out drunk on the street part_comma_ but I am very pumped to be going
i have a friend on facebook that posted a weird meme of someone mixing milk _comma_ nes quick and maya and swore its so good ... i almost threw up in my mouth 
oh man it was so nasty _comma_ i did not think that was a thing 
I recently was in a situation at work where I had a colleague take credit for months of my work_comma_ and go out of their way to tell my boss and others in a committee that I actually held the team back.
Honestly_comma_ I'm indifferent as to how it's shared. Later_comma_ my boss actually sat me down and told me they knew my colleague was out of line. Ironically_comma_ their contract with our company was up two weeks later and they weren't renewed. 
It is what it is. I would never wish for anyone to lose their job_comma_ but I am thankful that in the end I was able to stay in the good graces of senior leadership.
For sure! I appreciate the support. Professionalism is tantamount.
My favorite time of year is the holidays. I get to see my family that I miss so much during the year.
Yeah I really enjoy spending time with them and talking about our different lives.
I am so upset with my kids.
They never go to bed at a decent time. I can't get any sleep and am always rushing for work in the morning
We will all be bums if I lose my job
My boss at my old job was nice enough to put in a good word for me at a new organization and helped me land a higher paying job!
Absolutely. He was a great boss and I'm very thankful that he was willing to help me.
I ate half a sandwich before realizing the bread was old and moldy! It was gross!
It didn't make me sick_comma_ but it definitely made me FEEL sick for a short period. I guess mostly mental.
I just finished moving and got charged double what I was quoted by the moving company!
They said the extra fees are for unexpected situations beyond their control... They will be getting a bad rating
You are very right and I am definitely on it!
I'm furious_comma_ I was almost killed by a semi-truck because he just randomly merged into my lane without looking!
No_comma_ luckily I swerved into the outer-most lane and there wasn't a car there. Thank God!
Nope_comma_ just kept going like nothing happened!
MY daughter is headed to high school. I am nervous.
She doesn't even think it's a big deal. What is wrong with her?
I guess so. Maybe I just don't want her to grow up.
It just reminds me that I'm older too. geez
I am going to do much better this semester than last.
I did_comma_ but barely. I have a good plan. I got a good schedule and the classes I want so it should work out.
I hope so. I am determined to make dean's list.
My grandmother is moving into a retirement community in town after 30 years of living in another state.  I can't wait to be able to visit her all the time!
Yeah_comma_ her health hasn't been great the last couple of years_comma_ unfortunately_comma_ so I can't wait to do everything I can to bring her up to par.
It is very nice and half the price of the place she has been living_comma_ so she is in a good position.
When I was a kid_comma_ my house was hit by a tornado_comma_ I was scared to death!
Thankfully everyone was ok_comma_ but yes_comma_ the house was hit good and we had to move.
My girlfriend was feeling nauseous this morning and thinks she's pregnant. She went to get tested_comma_ and I am praying that she isn't. 
If she isn't pregnant then I can sigh as relief. If not_comma_ then we will have to discuss our future.
Thank you_comma_ I have been so worried all day.
We just hired an exterminator last week for silverfish.  Now we have them worse than ever!
They are bugs that get everywhere in the house.  I am pretty hacked off at the exterminator for not doing his job right
MY neighbors have been moving in for a month
I don't know but they bring in furniture almost every day. And they do it late at night. It;s annoying
ME too. That apartment isnt that darn big_comma_
I recently got into watching golf on TV. I am so amazed at how good some of the pro players are.
It's not for everyone. I just like the strategy and slow pace of the game. It is so serene.
I ave the worst mailman
He never closes the mailbox. Sometimes my mail flies away
I told him and it changed nothing. I could lose something important
I just retired and feel truly happy for the first time in my life.
It's so much better than you can even imagine.  
so i did jiu jitsu for 3 years _comma_ and now my brother and his wife have done jiu jitsu for 1 year _comma_ and the other day i was in shock when they enrolled my 3 year old nephew into jiu jitsu too ... omg the kids gonna be a monster 
i hope the kid stays with it too_comma_ it will give him a lot of discipline and useful skills in life like self confidense 
While visiting the zoom_comma_ I noticed some of the workers going into a panic and then they began running. I learned later that lion had escaped it's enclosure!
I did. We ran to the closest bathroom and stayed inside for a while! I think the zoo is going to be in big trouble. They gave everyone a refund and also free tickets.
I got locked out of my house today because I forgot my key. I called my parents and they were mad at me.
Yea I was lucky enough to be able to go to my friends house_comma_ but I still have stuff to do at home.
I was excited when my kid asked to try out for cheerleading. She practiced hard and made the team.
That is right. I am so happy that she set a goal and reached it.
My father is going to give me a watch that has been passed down for 3 generations!
Yes_comma_ and it really means a lot to him_comma_ so it's putting pressure on me to have kids!
My power lifting coach bench pressed 650 pounds for 3 reps. I couldn't believe my eyes!
He does actually_comma_ he goes to power lifting meets pretty regularly and breaks records! He's amazing.
I bought some milk today. My kids love cereal!
Froot Loops and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. But I have to go back to the store because the milk I bought epires tomorrow. ISnt that crazy!
I know right. I shouldve paid closer attention to the date. It shouldnt have even been on the shelf though
I lost a lot of  money at the casino
If I had a husband he would leave me. That much!
I don't think I have one I never gamble. I don't think I will again either.
I have been single for the past year.
I hate to be by myself.
My friends from high school decided to gather and have dinner together. I was the only one left out. So disappointed in them
I think i will just let it go and not to talk to them ever again. Such times provide good lesson to learn who is true friend and who is not
Nothing makes me mad like when people leave their grocery carts in the middle of the parking lot. How inconsiderate is that?
Aldi has the right idea. You pay a quarter to get a cart and only get your quarter back if you return it.
I found out that my girlfriend has been cheating on me.
I am so hurt right now.
I am afraid to send my 3 year old to daycare.
He doesn't talk yet and I am just afraid he will be mistreated.
ME too. I can't take that chance
At work I am the most confident man ever_comma_ maybe because I've worked there so long.  
No_comma_ I'm very friendly_comma_ it's just I wish I was that way outside of work.
I took like 200 dollars worth of clothes to the counter at macys
I left my wallet. I was so embarassed I didnt go back after I made it to the counter.
Lol I didn't steal them... not this time
I miss my old house in Orlando
I miss mostly the city of Orlando.I grew up there and i used to go to every park.
I got locked out of my house today and couldn't shower despite being really sweaty.
Yes I am just at my friends house waiting for my parents to come home to unlock it.
I feel so alone these days
I just moved to a new city and I do not know anyone.
MY kid is going to be all dolled up on the first day of school
I just love dressing them up. Her uniform is so cute .ITs her first day of kindergarten
1
I was trying to buy a house_comma_ but I didn't have enough credit history to get approved.
My dad offered to cosign for me_comma_ so I was able to get it!
I'm ready to meet my interviewer tomorrow.
Are you nervous?
MY son stayed over a friends house las week
IT was. He was well behaved. I was surprised because he is only 3 and I spoiled him. oops
She is my best friend and she has all boys
I went to Jack N The Box the other day_comma_ and there was a long gray hair in my burger!
Yeah_comma_ last time I'll be back there_comma_ I was so turned off I skipped dinner completely.
Yesterday_comma_ i saw my neighbor litter the driveway with chocolate bar package when he finished eating it. I was disgusted by his act
I saw it from the window and decided not to yell from a distance like an uncivilized
That is a sad thing to hear. I hope you are happy to be rid of them both now
Because my life changed so much. I lost my best friend and my boyfriend at the same time. 
Yes_comma_ now I see it was for the best. 
i did not get to go with my friend to the concert_comma_ so i went by myself. worse decision ever . Should of just stayed home
i did not enjoy it
My little brother just got into college!
I am! I'm excited to see what he does with his life. So many opportunities
I can't afford this dress I want for a wedding I have to attend. I tried to save up for it but it didn't work out for me.
That's what I'm going to do but I did have my heart set on that one! It was beautiful!
Yeah_comma_ I'll get over it and have a good time anyway! That's what matters.
My friends randomly stopped by to check on me as I had been feeling bad
Indeed. I have such a wonderful group of friends who understand me and I'm thankful for that
life is so good. I have everything i need_comma_ i have a great job_comma_ wonderful wife and a beautiful baby boy
it is. I was actually without job for a couple of months
I am feeling happy I have money saved up.
I know right? Sometimes you don't even have enough for bills let alone to save! I almost never have had a time in life where I have been able to save any money.
I got my cat room_comma_ turtle cage and everything else clean yesterday. I went in to the day hoping to get all of it done and I did. 
I hear! I let depression get to me at times. I went in to the day hoping to get all of it done and I did. It's nice when you get everything accomplished you need too.
Will power is hard but it's possible_comma_ working out..while I hate it- helps me feel better and get better motivation.
My cat decided to scratch my face as I was trying to give him a bath
I did. I was afraid it might have something in it as he tends to run around outside a lot. That's all I need lol
Hello_comma_ have you ever used a robot before?
It is fun and yes I have. I recently purchased one
It was a smaller red_comma_ carpet cleaning one! But it broke down quickly..
My husband is wanting to take a job in another state.
It is_comma_ but not much different than what he already has and I just don't know if it's a good idea to make the move right now. I don't want to uproot our kids.
I am super ticked at people who just want to make everything upsetting for everyone else. 
You know those people who are just miserable and in a bad complaining mood and they hate it when you're happy and just want to be mean?
I can't believe I'm even sharing this with anyone because I want to forget it but earlier I was walking around the office with my dress shoved in my underwear!
I have no idea! I don't even know if anyone noticed because they didn't tell me! I figured it out myself when I went to the bathroom again.
You have a way of making me feel a little better_comma_ thank you!
I have a wide open window and screen right next to my driveway because someone broke it the other day when I wasn't home.
No- It's my cat room..and theres no way they could be anywher ebut the cat room as I have a dog on each side that would KILL them...However_comma_  I am not sure how to fix it and I'm in a bad neighborhood so it's a bit scary.
i can afford groceries now when before i could not even buy soup
i hope it continues
I found $50 in my desk drawer at work.
I was very happy.  Its like money from god. I didn't even know I had it.
Can't agree more.  Although I probably shouldn't be so excited... it is *my* money.
I had a flighty yesterday and there was a baby crying all the way for 2 hours.
I agree_comma_ i wanted to throw the baby off the airplane.
i lost lots of weight_comma_ i can walk around with my shirt off and open now. So proud of myself that i'm not a fatso anymoe
i am and i am planning to keep this up_comma_ its just a part of life now for me
I was at the mall yesterday and saw my ex with a new guy.
No really_comma_ and thats why I am so jealous that she has a new partner already.
I was very scared when my mom went in the hospital and was going to have surgery. 
Yes but I wasn't sure she would make it out then. It's scary when someone goes on surgery especially when they are older
My friend got promoted and I've been at my job forever and still didn't get a promotion. kind of jealous a little bit
I do want to quit but i need to find a different job before i quit. It's kind of hard to find a new job
My duck is getting on my nerves a bit. He is a big fat guy and screams all the time if he feels he hasn't had enough food.
Not at all! They are lovely critters. But he is just a bit of a fatty boy and likes his food. He is lovely and so sweet! I protect all animals :)
He has duck food and also greens- veggies and fruit. He just likes his food a little too much
Why is it so hard to make friends as an adult? No one seems to like me and it's discouraging.
I've tried going to coffee shop meetups_comma_ joining some Facebook groups interested in making friends in my city but no go!
I wouldn't try a church_comma_ it's not my style and I can't move_comma_ I'll just keep plugging away at it.
I read a horror story last night.
It's Chalk_comma_ which is written by Paul Cornell.
The other day I ate an entire pizza. I felt so bad
The other day I ate an entire pizza. I felt so bad
I was a large. It was so good though. It was delivered and was the pergect temperature. I couldnt turn down any of the slices. I love a good sausage and pepperoni pizza.
I have a class tomorrow that I am excited about.
It is a history class. I am a student!
My mom brought home some cheesecake for my little brother_comma_ because he did well on his test the other day. Cheesecake is my favorite. I snuck about half of the portion and ate it_comma_ and I feel bad. I couldn't resist...
No! Cheesecake isn't really healthy for you.. A lot of cream cheese_comma_ butter_comma_ fat_comma_ sugar. It's a dessert_comma_ if you've never had it. And I felt bad since my brother really did deserve it. I got chastised a little bit_comma_ and scolded_comma_ by ultimately my brother wasn't that sad and my mother decided if I went and bought more_comma_ it'd be no big deal.
MY friend got back with her ex boyfriend
I am not. He is terrible. She promised that she was done. Im really mad at her.
Yeah I know_comma_ but he has done a lot of things. Its just sad really. 
Vacation is soon for me! I can't wait!
Just for the beach for a few days but it's really needed. I need to relax and recharge.
It looks like it will be great weather so even better!
I am going to visit my best friend next month.
Yes very much. I haven't seen her in 4 years.
I knew I was going to win a reward at work. I worked hard for it
It really was
I won a trip to disneyland.
I know I can't wait!
I haven't been there since I was a child.
HEY... WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES
WHAT ABOUT READING SOME BOOKS ...
I LOVE TO READ .. INFACT IT IS A PART OF MY LIFE
My friends invited me to go to the movies with them after work!
I am! I haven't been in many years_comma_ so it will be fun to see how it's changed and to catch up with them
I auditioned for a spot on the LA Kings Ice girls team.
I think it went really well. I will find out next week if I made it.
I feel upset that someone I know would throw away progress constantly.
Right? They continue to listen and do things but none of it is doing anything because it's all a show.
I ordered my kids school supplies pretty late this year
I still think they will arrive on time. I will do better next year.
Yep. I did have to pay a bit extra but I can't send them to school with nothing.
Thats a great idea!
I feel very protective of the new dog I got in. She was very abused and is just a puppy! 
She is so docile_comma_ and was so starved_comma_ I can't help but feel extra protective of her.
I'm happy with my new home
It has a lot of plants!
I am feeling trepidation about payday this week.
I don't now if someone in my life I know will act up and I am not looking forward to any drama.
No. Just someone who lives with me who makes money a big dramatic horrible issue. Think of Bipolar.
Resting in my bed in the morning is a great feeling_comma_ I feel so at ease when I don't have to rush to be anywhere.
Do you not get it often?
I will! I don't get to do it too often.
I have to put my dog down_comma_ she's so sick. I don't know how I am going to cope with this.
How do you get through it?
That's a good outlook_comma_ at least as good as it gets. I'll try to remind myself of that.
I am sad that someone I know chooses to not take ahold of their life and have a better one. 
EVen more then irresponsible but destructive. They continue to just destroy it and it's very hard to see when so many would kill to have their life.
I am concerned that the prices for everyday products will rise with President Trump threatening tariffs against China
I am not even sure if he has any concrete plans to tackle this issue. If not_comma_ then Congress must act to stop it from happening
I was a bit shocked that someone was so nice this morning after being so rotten yesterday.
yes especially after they did a lot to you and haven't even said sorry.  I can't deal with people with such huge mood swings.
I'm off that train so they aren't coming back on board until they get better.
The last time I had to fly for work_comma_ we had issues when it came time to land.
Yes_comma_ after the storms calmed down we were able to land. It was rough but everyone was okay.
I almost stepped on a snake today.

That is too bad. I hope you are able to move on.
I went to the grocery store and someone stole my purse.
No_comma_ it was when my back was turned.  I am so upset about it.
I've been applying for new jobs but_comma_ I haven't found one yet

I get pretty bad road rage when my life is threatened.

People are just rude nowadays.
I have been with my boyfriend for nine years now
I think I'm going to break up with him. Nine years and last week he ordered a pizza for us covered in black olives.
Exactly. I realized yesterday he does that all the time. 
Nine years. He should know already.
I feel really glad I have money saved up.

I miss when my toddlers were little tiny babies.
So many. I don't want them to grow up. Why can't they be babies again
One day they will want to leave home... NO!!!!!
i cant wait for my new raise to kick in!
they come in handy.. even a little raise that pays for an extra tank of gas is worth it
i was looking at pictures of my kids the other day and got a little sad
yea i wish they didnt grow up
I ordered a half pound of turkey at the deli. That is not what I got.
I got some weird cajun roast beef. I didn't even notice until I was gonna make sandwiches.
I Will do that next time for sure. The kids were bothering me so I wasn't paying attention.
The abused dog I took in is finally RUNNING and playing.
I try! I am just glad she is calm and nice! thank god! I didn't think she had it in her to play or even run. It is so nice to see!
:)))
My mom is taking me on a cruise! She's never done anything like this for me before!
I know_comma_ she is a wanderer so I will need to keep her close.
Yesterday was a very hard day_comma_ in addition to drama_comma_ I felt so alone.
Relationship drama. Someone who has a lot of mental and emotional issues_comma_ thats why I live alone and don't see many so it can get hard on days like the weekend.
Oh I know what to do_comma_ They aren't here anymore but it is still hard. Somethings in life are hard no matter what.
i bought a new gun and i can't wait to go to the range! I really love going to the range
I believe I'm pretty good. I have to be! I work as an armed guard
Last week_comma_ i thought i saw a ghost outside my window!!
Well i freaked out like hell and started screaming. But all it was a prank from my friends
sometimes i trust my relatives a little too much when i shouldnt
left my dog with a relative and they didnt lock the gate and he got out and ran away
My wife is thinking about divorcing me.
I don't think so. I am really torn up about it.
I got into a small fender bender. the car wasn't damaged_comma_ just a tiny scratch! I was shocked when collision center told me it would cost 526$ to fix that tiny scratch
that makes no sense! Such a rip off. I told them "no_comma_ thank you" i'm okay with that scratch
i was mad yesterday when i saw someone had put a dent in my door
yea i wish i saw the person that did it
I haven't made any friends since I moved out here.
I've tried going to church and bars.  I hate being by myself.
I am a bit envious of my friends
They have nicer homes and cars than I do. Plus they are all married. I work just as hard and I have nothing
My mom said that too lol
My daughter snuck out of the house last night on a school night! I could punish her for the rest of her life!
14 and this is so not like her!
No_comma_ I need to calm down or I might say some things I'll regret later out of anger!
I made a surprise visit to my grandma home.
yeah_comma_ she won't depend anyone for her needs.
Someone broke my window to my cat room and pushed in the screen.
I do not know. Someone in my neighborhood did it. Bad neighborhood. It makes me furious more than anything
I really think this year is going to end great_comma_ and be one for the record books. 
Moneywise yes for sure_comma_ but also just in general being happy. I guess money is happiness right now for me. 
i loved taking care of my sisters bearded dragon the other day
they are friendly once they get to know you.. but when they tense up their spikes can hurt sometimes
Kids in my neighborhood put dog poop on my front stoop_comma_ how nasty.
It's so gross!

I always forget my password on websites

Do you have any suggestions?
My son was on the A honor roll all last year.
Thank you.  I am so pleased with his performance.
I lost my car keys and someone returned them to the bar.
It was.  It also had my keyring with *all* of my keys
Or an uber good idea
I am upset that I have been used for so long. 
By someone I cared about. After you get out of a situation you realize how bad it was.
i was scared walking home the other day
it was late and the street wasnt lit up
Feeling strange about payday. It is a stressful time 
even more so now when dealing with mental illness of the one getting the payday
Beyond! I never know what they will do with the money.
I wish I could but they play a good game when in front of others. They are very smart about it. It's a tough situation..Think Bipolar_comma_ ptsd_comma_ childhood issues etc..FAS
I just got cable again. I was upset because I couldnt find anything to watch
Well_comma_ we just realized we have the babytv channel. Its my sons favorite. He loves everything on the channel. He is 3

I just pulled into Sturgis.  I am vacationing her to see the Rally and all the bikes
I rode out...what an amazing experience.
I recently ran by an ad online for this online swimsuit store. It seemed to be based outside of the US so I was a bit skeptical to order from them. I ordered anyway and will wait to see what happens.
It was advertised on facebook_comma_ and others were commenting on it complaining about the sizing being off quite a bit_comma_ so I assumed they had gotten what they purchased_comma_ you know?
i had to assist a mom with two daughters who all had lice

It's alright. Some of them are cool_comma_ some of them are uneventful. It's fun for people watching. Other times it's a hassle. I usually try to get long layover times so that I don't have to rush.
My boyfriend is always talking on the phone when we are hanging out.

I learned about Neurofeedback today.
It helps people who have PTSD_comma_ Autism_comma_ Bipolar_comma_ Depression and anyone with trauma- Brain issues- Its kind of like electro shock but without pain. It helps retrain your brain.
No. I thought about going to school for counseling but I have had enough of that in my own household lol. I live with someone with a mental illness so I have had to learn a lot and figure stuff out. I have always been huge on research and reading and different things to help. It's been hard to help this person as they have SO many issues..even with meds and diet etc..It's been hard. So Neurofeedback seems promising in addition to many other therapies.

Watching someone stream an old video game on Twitch_comma_ one that I used to play. It's one that's like almost 20 years old_comma_ that I used to play when I was 11. Makes me wish I didn't have so many bills and responsibilities!
Haha_comma_ I doubt anyone would watch me. I'm not terrible in terms of personality_comma_ but I'm just another person. Twitch is all about luck. But I appreciate your thought! Obviously there were some crappy things about being a kid_comma_ too.I wish we could just hit a switch and be able to go back and forth every now and then.

I don't like the idea of closing and consolidating schools and making the kids ride for thirty minutes to two hours on a bus both ways_comma_ just to save a few bucks.
Ew interesting. I think high school and earlier is so important and college too.
Yeah_comma_ especially if it was a good school and area to grow up in.

he is in rehab but it's been a 3 month journey and he is having to learn to move again
I'm sort of scared for this upcoming weeked :/
Nothing.  I'm going to ride rollercoasters this weekend.  So scared of them.
Yeah.  Maybe if I drink a couple beers before hand lol
My boss is announcing who is being promoted tomorrow in the open position_comma_ and I just know it's me.
I'm so ready_comma_ I have this feeling so I'm embracing it.
It nearly doubles what I make now!
My younger sister is getting married before I am_comma_ I can't believe it.
It's hard when all I can think about is being green with envy. What's wrong with me? I can't even get a date!
I'm going on a long train ride tomorrow! From South Carolina to New York! I'm just going to see an old college friend for a couple of days_comma_ but I'm just as pumped about the train ride_comma_ because I've never been on one before! They seem so peaceful and charming.
Yeah_comma_ I am. I didn't even know they did across-the-country train rides... Those would be cool. Or maybe they would get boring because you'd start to feel cramped? Who knows. It just always seems like when you hear about trains in movies and TV_comma_ they have this romantic quality about them. Maybe it's because they feel like they're from a different era
Oh man that sounds like a really cool idea. Thanks for telling me about that.. sometimes it's surprising the creative things people come up with
I was really pleased when my son came home excited about being on the honor roll
I really am. 
We took the kids fishing this weekend
It was.  They had a blast and I caught the biggest catfish I've ever caught!
Yeah it was a lot of fun.  Definitely need to do it again!
I remember when I used to take the train to work.
Yes_comma_ those were some special times.
 am so thankful to come home to a nice clean home
I cleaned it myself finally
My entire family went to Europe for the summer. It is just me at the house.
I have to work_comma_ there is no way I can take an entire month off.
I am angry that I can not go out this weekend.
I have to work the entire weekend.
I was on a flight and a kid kept kick the back of my chair.
Yes_comma_ I was so irritated.
We are going to disney world this year!
I am the kid I think!
Getting my bags packed for vacation!
Me too!  We're hitting up Panama City in a couple weeks!
There's more stuff to do than the beach though! 
The new movie theater is opening soon.
I can't wait to go there!
I left my girlfriend because i was cheating on her.
I wanted a new snack in my life.
I had to have some work done on my car. Luckily the mechanic gave me a good deal. 
I needed some work done on my fuel pump. Im glad he didnt have to replace the whole part.
I went fishing over the weekend and made a pretty sweet catch!
It was every bit of 10-15 lbs catfish.  Scared the heck out of me when he hit on the bait!
Not yet.  Probably will in a couple days. It was a great weekend to say the least!
I went to the movies and let out a giant fart while I was walking past some people to my seat.
I was pretty humiliated_comma_ but I went up a few rows and forgot about it before the end of the movie.  When the lights came back on I was reminded of at all over again though.
Good advice!
I was walking in the grocery store and i fell and slipped in some spilled milk.
No not at all. I just got up and couldnt stop laughing at myself. I could feel the heat coming off of my face.
My best friend just bought a jet ski.
Probably_comma_ but I am really envious of him.
I have a small leak in my water heater that I was hoping to get fixed today.
I was a bit dismayed when the plumber failed to show up.
My friend sent me a package from Germany. i had no idea what was inside.
No not at all. It was full of different food items. I was so anxious opening it though. 
Going to Florida in less than a month
Pleasure.  I just hope my car makes the 9 hour drive.  she has about 167k miles on her :/
Yeah..  I hope she does okay
I wasn't feeling well but didn't get enough warning so I didn't make it to the bathroom in time.
I am but I can't believe it happened in front of a room full of people_comma_ yikes!
We found a huge black snake in our backyard today! Gives me the chills just thinking about it. 
Really?  Well_comma_ I will take a snake over bugs any day.  It was much bigger than ones I have seen in the past.  We're talking 10 feet long.  We got it into a bin and took it to a field.
 I rescued an abandoned dog the other day_comma_ and I ended up getting an award from the ASPCA.
For being an outstanding advocate for animals in the community.  It was the 26th dog I've rescued this year.
I just adopted this rescue dog. He's a sweet and timid little dachshund missing one leg. He's precious.
He was found with a wire in it because he got caught in it.  It was too infected to save.  It doesn't seem to bother him not having it.
I eat while I am asleep and I can't control it_comma_ but I am humiliated by it.
My doctor said I should tie myself up in a mummy sleeping bag so I can't get out.  I tried it a few times_comma_ but I tore the sleeping bag to get to the nighttime chocolate treats.
That would be really helpful_comma_ thank you.  My doctor has written me off because he calls me an aggressive night eater.  Sometimes I find that I have ordered a pizza and ate right through the box to get to it.  I've never told anyone that before.
Someone threw a bunch of trash in my yard.
Yes_comma_ it makes me so mad!
It's really amazing the amount of great doctors that write books.
I had a lot of research to do and I love that there is so much information readily available.
I get my new vacuum tomorrow! It's been a long time since I bought one brand new.
Yes they do_comma_ I just hate spending money if I don't have too. I have a kirby but it needs to be fixed and I don't know how to do it. So I found a great deal on a new one until then. Can't wait to get cleaning! I like to clean weirdly...
Oh yes! If only I could buy one whenever one got worn out lol
I don't think I should get on my flight in the morning.
I just have a bad feeling and I think it'd be best if I cancel it!
I yelled at my two-year-old nephew the other day_comma_ because he wasn't paying attention and spilled something_comma_ made a huge mess. I've been yelling at him off and on recently since he started living with my family for a short period of time. It's so hard to keep my patience in the moment... But then later on I feel so terrible that I can't be a better human being to him.
Yeah. I'm trying to handle myself better. It's hard when you're arguing with the child about the same thing_comma_ every day_comma_ day after day. It feels like running into a wall. You want to teach them_comma_ but they don't listen_comma_ or they don't show improvement. And obviously it's because he's two and he's just going to naturally take time to develop. But in the meantime_comma_ I struggle to not overreact.
I haven't had fries in over a year. Finally got some today.
Yea_comma_ I do okay_comma_ but it does make me sleepy.
Someone stole my lawn mower. Suffice to say...I am not a happy camper.
Thanks! I can't stand thieves! I work hard for the things I have!
I am feeling lonely but settled because things are peaceful. 
Nah_comma_ I have had that time pass. I am not up for people. Lonely meaning without a partner I live with. Yes_comma_ I love no drama in my home :)
My friend taught himself how to skate_comma_ and he just won his first competition.
I'm not familiar with skating myself_comma_ but he was skating on some kind of rap and doing all kinds of tricks.
I can't seem to get to sleep tonight_comma_ too much on my mind.
No_comma_ its just that I am starting a new job tomorrow.
I want to visit my friend who lives an hour away in a big city_comma_ but I'm a bit nervous about driving in such a busy city.
I'll definitely have to sip on some coffee while making the drive so I can stay more alert_comma_ that's for sure.
It's amazing how much research goes in too helping others. 
Very true! That is why everyone does different things. Very complex to keep it going! I was researching neurofeedback today and it's nice to see how much some doctors care about helping.
Well..I have had some terrible experiences with doctors as have many but there are some who do care about helping.
Saw a marching band pass by my work today. Kind of miss playing my flute
I don't really have much time_comma_ but maybe I should make some for it.
I am feeling a little bad I forgot bird food this weekend. The birds and squirrels gather on my fence line when everything is empty :(
No I have to go tomorrow. I feel a deep pain when I am not taking care of them. They definitely expect it! I LOVE making sure all the critters are fed- with how cruel the world is to them- It's the least I can do..also skunks_comma_ bunnies etc at night like to come too. I will go get it tomorrow_comma_ I promise!
I am feeling happy I can afford what I need for the past few months.
Oh yes_comma_ I've been poor most of my life. It's nice to be able to get something if you need it.
Two incomes and a decent paying job. I am doing a business on the side so I don't have to be poor anymore. It's not very much fun.
I was stuck home the other day with the flu. 
Right?! I was miserable_comma_ stuck all day in bed.
It was_comma_ but I am very grateful to my wife. She let me rest all day_comma_ and brought me food and drinks to be as comfortable as possible. :)
Thank you! Hopefully you can avoid it this year. 
I applied for a better position within my job_comma_ crossing my fingers I hear positive news!
Yes_comma_ I'm eager to hear back already
I went on a bike ride after work today.  It was very peaceful.  Just me_comma_ the mountains_comma_ and my thoughts.  
It was perfect.  Not to warm_comma_ nice breeze.  Very good to release some stress. 
I am lucky to have a decent paying job
I work for an online retail company.  I don't make a lot of money but I am not struggling anymore
My dog just passed away and he was the only friend I had.
Yeah_comma_ it has been hard these last few days.  He had cancer_comma_ but he went pretty fast at the end.
I asked my mother where she left my drawing_comma_ she said she threw it out.
I asked my mother where she left my drawing_comma_ she said she threw it out.
I was younger and i spent all day.
I can not wait for my cruise during Thanksgiving.

Thanks.  I'm so hurt over it.
Took my nephew fishing over the weekend
Yeah it was!  He caught a large bass!  He did so well :D
It was pretty fun.  He did a good job!  Hope we go again soon.
I went to a restaurant for mexican food with my friend and she had a roach crawl off of her salad. It was horrifying.
They offered both of us money back and free meals for next time but we are never going back.  It turned me off of mexican food which is a shame because its my favorite!
I love my husband so much. He is an amazing guy that wouldn't do anything to hurt me.
Me to! It is amazing that I found someone great. I hope my daughter finds a great man also. She is 17 and I worry about that all the time.
I was almost short on my rent this month.
I overspent at the mall. My grandma helped me cover it though.
I can't believe that Robin Williams died.
I really enjoyed his movies_comma_ especially the movie Mrs. Doubtfire.
I am feeling more positive about the future today.
Oh you know_comma_ because of people. They try and get you down. I have been around a misery loves company type. I am really trying to hold on to that feeling no matter what. It's hard!
So true! The right people mean everything.
I went into work this morning and had an unexpected bonus sitting on my desk!
It was $250.  My boss just sold a big account and decided to share the wealth with everyone in the office.  It was very nice of him.
This was a hard weekend. Second weekend alone.
No. I just kicked someone out. It's different living alone. Peaceful though. But hard.
Yes and Yes. They need help. I am not their punching bag. 
5
Sorry about that_comma_ Miss type.  But i was going to talk about the time the my two best friends fell in love
I hope_comma_ but i cant hide the fact that i am envious
Last week I entered a contest to win an ipad at work and today I got the news that I won!
No_comma_ I never win! I didn't expect this lol
We have to fly across the country this coming weekend and I hate flying so much! I feel dizzy just thinking about it.
Thanks_comma_ that's a good idea.  I was looking into borrowing my friends headphones and blasting music and looking at techniques to relax.  I feel so ill when I fly.  Its odd because I can't stop the feelings.
I am looking forward to the next Star Wars movie.
I can't wait to see it! You should check them out sometime.
During gym class today but pants split wide open. Everyone in the class could see my underwear.
The underwear were black silk_comma_ so I have no idea.
My best friend's dog died and she has been really upset.
I brought over some pizza and movies to cheer her up.
I feel I can do things on my own. I didn't always feel this way_comma_ so it's nice 
My resolve I guess? Nothing changed for the better but inside me at least I know I can do it on my own because it's 1000 times better than the alternative. I'll do whatever it takes.
I think I did really well on my exam today
It was for entry into a college program I've wanted to get into. I feel like I did really well!
I really don't want to go to the dentist next week.

My nephew caught a huge bass this weekend!

I do feel confident about it.  We haven't met in person yet_comma_ but she is coming to visit me in Nigeria tom
Thank you.
I am getting older and it's hard to think on how many bad things I have experienced.\
Oh I have. I always maintained my glass half full though as so many have it worse! But it does get harder as the years go on. Life really doesn't always turn out how you think it will or how you want. It's a series of unfortunate and traumatic events a lot.
I stole money from my grandmother.
I needed money for beer.  I feel so ashamed about it.
I am ready for Connor Mcgregor's UFC fight in October.

Life can be really not a happy place.
Oh so many things. Lots of trauma. Life really is just full of lots of really difficult events..trying to maintain your spirit and being a good person through it_comma_ is really the task of life!
Thank you! I have tried..it's been a VERY traumatic year in so many ways..and I didn't think it could get any worse a few years ago..Wrong! I hear you with pain! Please try every treatment you can. DIET plays a HUGE role- also chiropractor_comma_ Nuerofeedback_comma_ Different herbs! I found eating right_comma_ exercising_comma_ herbs_comma_ vitamins_comma_ organic food helped with my pain caused by doctors- I had tons of neuropathy_comma_ pain and fibro like symptoms in addition to the trauma of deaths_comma_ abuse etc. I hope YOU feel better and YOU inspire me right now that I don't have it so bad!!!
THANK YOU! That sounds GREAT! yes the raw groups on FB have good diets too! I need to do vegan as well! Just can't afford it yet. Doing Fasting with Keto WOW- That is true! I just feel tapped out after so much abuse and trauma..and losing pets and children..Just too much trauma in a short time_comma_ but I am still here! I am trying to get better_comma_ it's just a long hard journey. LOVE to you! Stay strong and kind like you are! So inspiring!
I found pictures of when I was young_comma_ going camping with my grandparents. Those we such perfect times.
Yes_comma_ childhood seems like a dream.  My grandparents took me camping to so many spots and one time it even rained caterpillars from the trees! I do wish I could go back there and do some things again.
I was dancing at a wedding this weekend and I split my pants.
I tried to do a break dancing move that I used to be able to do_comma_ but that was 20 years ago.  I'm lucky my pants are the only thing that busted!  Hahahaha.
Rented tuxedo_comma_ so It will probably end up costing me pretty big.
I'm not looking forward to rollercoaster riding next weeked :(
Yeah!  I've never been on one.  We're taking the kids though.

Alrighty then!  Maybe I'll give it a shot!  
I found a huge nail on my car's tire... horrible thing to encounter early in the morningt
Yes I'm glad it didn't happen while I was driving at least
I can't wait to see the new James Bond movie.
Yes_comma_ I have really enjoyed the last few ones.
Last year_comma_ I was really very shocked and angry.
My grandmother passed away.
A man was chasing me down the alley last night.
He wanted my money.  I was scared for my life.
I am so happy to have my crazy family close. 
Most of us do and the rest aren’t too far out. How about you?
Once I sneezed very loud next to my friend and a buger shot on her.
I was petrified.  I was really crushing on her too
My roommate moved out_comma_ it is just me now living at the house.
He got a new job that was in a different city. It isn't good or bad.
I was feeling ill and fatigued the last couple months and just found out that I'm pregnant. Wasn't expecting that!
I have two kids and was done having kids but guess not!  I'm excited about it but it definitely shocked me!  I thought I might have chronic fatigue.
My dog always barks when I am on the phone.
Yes_comma_ I try to get him to go outside_comma_ but he never wants to.
I found a hair in my soup at lunch today. I was not happy.
Oh she will be remaking it.  It was my wife that packed he lunch.  She has a tendency to lose her hair into my food and I'm getting tired of it.
I am scared that World War 3 may be near.
I am really worried that North Korea may attack us.
My nephew plays football this year.  So proud of him!
Not sure yet.  Last year he played center.  I'm sure he will do good whatever he plays this year.
Yeah he's really tall.  Last year he was the biggest kid on the team in 8th grade lol
Yesterday I was so much irritated. I loudly screamed on my bother.
My little brother always plays electric guitar. And that's too irritating.

Two days left before the trip_comma_ I was beside myself.
I went to Disney world_comma_  my entire family tagged along.
I should of got a degree in computer science_comma_ my friend just graduated and is making 30 grand more than me!

Struggling but doing ok I guess_comma_ just got to pay off my debt.
I am in the middle of a contract dispute and I don't know what is going to happen.
Someone owes me a lot of money_comma_ but they don't want to pay.  I don't want to go to court_comma_ but I may have to go that direction.
Ever been to Niagara Falls? I just went and it blew my mind on the size of it!
Yeah_comma_ you definitely should go_comma_ very worth while.
I have never cheated on any exams in school.
I have been tempted but I would rather fail my exams than cheat.
I saw some old pics on FB of my dog who is passed and my niece.
No_comma_ I am not a big crier.  It was hard to see but they were good memories.
Ok?
I love being able to be home for my kids
I have 3. What about you?
I just found out that my parents are moving back near me! They'll be here in about a month!
They moved away for a job about 8 years ago so its been a while.  They just love our hometown so they were working to come back if they could.  It makes me so happy! 
I interviewed for a job promotion today.  I am pretty sure I nailed the interview.
It is a promotion in my finance department.  I really think I got this one in the bag
I got a $50 bonus and it was very unexpected AND needed!
I am! It always comes at the right time sometimes.
Oh pet food_comma_ groceries and bills! lol- Whatever it will cover :)
My mom makes me babysit my nephew all the time.

It's at a law firm. I've been trying to get this job for months_comma_ it's going to be great.
I am playing an official gig with a band I'm in and I can't wait. I know we'll be amazing.
Thanks! Its good to actually get some money out of it.  We play folk music with a rock twist.  Its great music.
I walked into my living room to see my entire extended family holding presents.
I was in awe_comma_  all of that just for my birthday.
My friend put vinegar on his ice cream sundae.
It looked and smelled really gross.
I'm pretty worked up right now_comma_ my wife went out to dinner with her friends and didn't bring me anything home!
She must be mad about something_comma_ she always at least asks if I want anything!
Hey there_comma_ Got to admit_comma_ I'm pretty lonely right now. 
My wife went out of town for work for a week_comma_ and I'm not used to having the place to myself.
I could_comma_ but they all have lives now.
My neighbor woke me up this weekend mowing his lawn at 5am. 
I have no idea. I was pissed because I went to ask him to stop and he just ignored me.
I didn't get the promotion at work_comma_ I cant believe Becky got it over me... I'm really upset about it.
I don't know_comma_ It just seems like she always gets everything. ugh ! Sometimes I wish I could be as lucky as her.
I had been getting ready for this day for years_comma_ It was in the bag
My dissertation was due_comma_  Hardest thing i had ever completed.
My white dog doesn't want to go outside lately but once he is out there_comma_ he is fine like he normally is!

Going to Florida in a couple weeks
Just taking a vacation to the beach.  Not very excited about the 9 hour drive though.
Yeah I guess I'll have to do that.  I hate long trips.  Thanks for the tip!
Recently heard that my father was laid off from his job. He's retirement age anyway_comma_ but I felt bad for him_comma_ as that must have been_comma_ at the very least_comma_ slightly humiliating. He's been a hard worker for 40 years_comma_ and has done well to support the family. But I do worry for him in the short-term.
Yeah_comma_ he gets severance. He was a hotel manager_comma_ and I don't think the hotel was doing well_comma_ but I'm not sure that could or would be entirely attributed to his performance. Think they just wanted a change of scenery. I'm partially glad_comma_ since he needs to relax anyway. It will be good for his health 
I was eating a hot dog at school. I started laughing and almost choked in from of the entire school.
No one helped me_comma_ they just all laughed. Luckily_comma_ I was ok.
I lost my credit card and someone charged 500 dollars on it.
They missed it.  I am so upset that it happened.
I just had a little girl 3 weeks ago and she had to go into the NICU for breathing problems. I am so happy that we got to bring her home yesterday.
The doctor said she's good.  She was born a month early so her lungs were just getting their bearings_comma_ so to speak.  She still has to be on a monitor for a while but I'm so thankful she's home and doing really well.
The deadline for the work project was coming in two days and I was not done yet. Thankfully_comma_ my co-worker agreed to help me even though he was not obliged to
I think I owe him. I wish every co-worker was like this in every workplace. What a wonderful world this would be
I am ready for my birthday next week.
I am going to Las Vegas for my birthday.
I'm quite upset at those I know that complain all the time.
Thats hard to do if you live with them lol. I get that we all can once in awhile..but incessantly day in and out no matter WHAT way things go...so either way? That's a problem.
It's my house_comma_ why would I move out ;)
My best friend won a free trip to Hawaii. I wish it was me who had won.
He has decided to take his girlfriend. I can't blame him for that.
My husband broke his back in a car wreck a couple of years ago. For 2 week after we came home the church brought us dinner every night.
He is doing amazing. We didn't want them to quit bringing food. It was so good.
My mom is always there for me.
Anytime I need anything she is right there to help me. I am so lucky.
You ever feel like you are the only person on the planet sometimes_comma_ like no one understands you?
Aw lol! Well that doesn't sound good at all! We are all weird in one way or another. I have went through a lot of trauma though and  It's hard when you feel disconnected to everything like that.
I have an exam next Monday that I plan to ace!
It's in Pure Mathematics. I'm great with numbers and I've been studying a lot. 
I am really happy when I see the Mile 22 trailer.
It is an action movie with Mark Wahlberg.
I kept looking at the door expecting my father to walk in any minute.
Yes_comma_ we was supposed to come see me_comma_ and he never showed.
I bought a pizza earlier and they overcharged me.
Nowadays_comma_ yes.  I am irritated about it. 
Everytime i leave the house_comma_ who is behind me? my little brother.
YES_comma_ i just want to see my own friends and not have to take care of him for once.
One night I couldn't sleep at all.
Well_comma_ I definitely didn't have to go anywhere because the next day was Christmas!
I feel a bit scared sometimes living alone in a rough neighborhood.
No_comma_ lol. That brings a lot of drama. I have dogs..but I don't have a weapons.
I tipped a vase over accidentally and it broke.
No_comma_ but I had to sweep it up quickly before my mom found out. 
No
Just got into an argument with my long distance girlfriend because she felt I wasn't listening to her closely enough while we were on the phone. She hung up_comma_ mad. Truth is_comma_ I was trying to do some work while talking to her_comma_ but I was listening as best I could_comma_ too.
I didn't. It's late at night and she's already tired. She had a hard day at work_comma_ and she was telling me about it. I wasn't offering detailed responses because they were about very specific things that I couldn't necessarily give a lot of insight to. So_comma_ I was just trying to be broadly supportive. She heard me clicking on something in the background_comma_ so she flipped and thought I wasn't paying attention at all.
I couldn't get into my car in the parking lot the other day and something was wrong with the lock_comma_ so I called a locksmith out to open the door and then realized_comma_ it wasn't my car. I wanted to crawl into a hole.
Ha ha.  I'm already laughing about it so no worries.  I felt like an idiot but also grabbed a picture of that car and my car and it even had the same beach sticker on the back of it. It was crazy!  Yeah_comma_ the locksmith was so nice that he didn't even charge me.  I was surprise but I guess he felt sorry for me.  he he.  
I walked in excited because i was finally going to the movie with my mother_comma_  and she was layed out asleep
She keeps telling me every day we can go.
Life doesn't always turn out how you expect it to be. 
IKR? You have to make the best out of lemons but that is hard sometimes.
I got a promotion at work today.
I am now a shift manager.  I am so shocked!
In front of everyone my friend jumped off the lunch table and did a backflip.
He is a crazy guy.  he said watch this and just hoped up on the table.
My girlfriend is mad at me_comma_ and I feel like when we try to have another discussion tomorrow about why we're fighting_comma_ she's just going to get even more angry with me. We're not the best at communicating.
In the early days of our relationship_comma_ we did. But then we matured in life and in our relationship_comma_ and our communication did improve a little. But I feel like she's so rash and overreactionary and sensitive at times.I want to put off arguments until we cool off_comma_ and she wants to have them immediately. We clash sometimes when it comes to perspectives.
We have relatively the same political views. It's never about that kind of stuff. It's more personal stuff. The next fight will probably be better if she isn't as tired. We'll see.
My sister had been feeling down after a breakup.
I talked her into coming over to my apartment to watch funny movies and eat junk food to get her mind off of it.
I had people stay at my house while I was gone over the weekend_comma_ so they wouldn't have to pay for a hotel. When I came back_comma_ they had left a mess and didn't really put in much effort to put things back where they found them. They were supposed to be good friends_comma_ too.
Not really. I hate confrontation. And nothing really of cost was lost. I'll just lose time in cleaning up after them. It definitely is a learning experience when it comes to trust... Doubt I'll be an AirBnB host any time soon!
I just moved for work to a new area where I don't know anyone. 
Well it's in another state. About 5000 miles. I feel far from home.
My son just said his first words this weekend.  They just came out of nowhere.
It was!  He has been a little bit of a late bloomer_comma_ but it was worth the wait.
I'm in a relationship right now_comma_ but sometimes I see people who are single and wish I could go back to a time where I had more freedom_comma_ a more simple life. Plus_comma_ the feeling of possibility. The grass is always greener though_comma_ I guess.
Yeah_comma_ and it's one I will do my best to abide by. I know I'm being stupid. But I feel like everyone gets those restless feelings of wanderlust. I don't know exactly how to overcome mine right now. Hopefully it's just a thing that will go away with time.
You know that feeling when loneliness just hits you in the gut?
Somewhat long distance here I guess? Someone is away at therapy of sorts..As I can't continue to live with them with their deep rooted problems.I have to remember the bad things that I lived with so I can make that feeling stop..then I don't feel as lonely.
I don't really LOL! I have been through a lot of trauma the past year and I only like people around I trust- no drama! Which is very few. As you get older..you realize you just want peace and people you love and who love you around- That's it! We can die at ANY minute..and I have lost MANY this past year..It makes you realize how short life is! Thank you for your kind words! It's always good to see other perspectives that help us feel appreciative of what we have :) Being grateful is the key to a happy life. Thanks for your kind words again!
My sky diving instructor was strapped to my back_comma_  and I had not a care in the world.
yes_comma_ we were flying through the air.  But i felt very safe.
My friends have been practicing for weeks. I think they'll do well at the volleyball match
It'll be their first match.
I am away in another country for 2 months and I left my apartment with my friend. 
I'm on vacation in the Bahamas! I feel they are very reliable so I am sure the place will be fine!
I am very nervous about my wife giving birth next month.
Yes_comma_ it is my first child. It is going to be a boy.
I was so upset when my pet goldfish died recently. I really loved Goldie.
Goldie was almost a year old. She was slowly swimming less and less so it wasn't completely unexpected.
I am sad but ready for my child to graduate high school.
Yes and he already knows where he is going to college.
I have a big certification exam coming up in 3 days and I feel like I'm ready to crush it.
Its the 4th exam of of 7 exams for architecture certification. It allows me to head my own design teams_comma_ etc. I have been studying for hours upon hours so I'm ready.
Last week was so hectic. On Monday my daughter forgot her project and I had to bring it to her at school.
To top it off_comma_ when I got to the school my daughter pointed out that I still had my pajamas on! It was so hectic that I forgot to get dressed!
Don't you hate that feeling when you get lonliness and it feels like it's going to make you vomit? 
:( Long distance is hard too! I just have to remember for myself that it is better to be at peace then to deal with horrible drama.
I just had a pretty good meal at the Olive Garden.
Yeah_comma_ it wasn't great but I was satisfied. I went with friends.
Just found out I'm not getting a promotion at work that I was up for. I'm kind of bummed to not be moving up in the company that I work for_comma_ as I really like everyone here_comma_ and the company itself_comma_ and what we do. But I'm satisfied knowing that someone more deserving than me got it_comma_ and that they still see me as worthy in the long run_comma_ and that I still get to enjoy my current situation.
Well_comma_ maybe so_comma_ but that's okay. Like I said_comma_ I like where I'm at now and I kind of hate change_comma_ so we'll stick it out for another year or two and see how it goes. I'm not in a big rush. It's the first job I've gotten since I graduated college_comma_ so I don't want to be too hasty and move around too much. I appreciate your viewpoint_comma_ though!
Tomorrow_comma_ I have my driving test. This whole weekend I practiced parallel parking which is the hardest part of it
I am trying to. My friend who got his recently_comma_ has been helping me with some insightful tips for the test
I have a C average but still graduated with a degree.
Thanks. I'm not as smart as others_comma_ but I did work hard.
I am looking forward to the upcoming football season.
The Dallas Cowboys!  I can't wait for tailgates!
I was walking my dog last night and I saw a furry animal rummaging in the neighbor's trash can.
I went closer to get a better look. The thing almost jumped on me. I was so shocked. It turned out to be a raccoon.
I'm going to Vegas next weekend. I can't wait!
hahah I hope I don't too much time gambling. Don't want to come home broke.
I'm going to drive a truck. Never driven a car that big before.
Thank you so much. I hope with time I'll be okay with it. For now_comma_ I'm kinda scared.
My wife just got a promotion and a 10% raise. I should be ecstatic for what this means for our family and financial future_comma_ but it's hard to not let my selfishness and ego get in the way_comma_ and think about how she's been more successful than me. We're currently in the same industry.
That's a fair point. But we do different jobs_comma_ just in the same industry. So I couldn't necessarily learn from her_comma_ but she's close enough to what I do_comma_ that I still subconsciously compare ourselves_comma_ even though I shouldn't. I know this will all pass in a few days_comma_ hopefully. But in the meantime_comma_ I hate that I have to actively not be passive aggressive towards her_comma_ when I should just be happy.
I was riding my bike yesterday near some woods. I heard a creepy voice say "come closer I need to tell you something".
Naturally I went in the woods to investigate. There was a really evil looking clown that started chasing me. I was so scared.
Went to the carnival this past weekend. It was a lot of fun
hahah there were actually_comma_ but no creepy ones.
Went to a local concert_comma_ and so many people were there. All the bands were unknown.
Yea_comma_ it was a whole lot of fun. Music was really good.
The other day I heard some strange noises coming from my attic. It sounded like someone was walking back and forth.
I am too scared to go look. I heard that the people who lived here before may have died in the home.
I've been stressing at work_comma_ and my coworker gave me a pair of movie tickets they weren't using
I'm not sure yet. Probably a feel good movie.
My friend speaks 4 languages. I'm sure they'll get that interpreter job at the embassy
Yea. English of course_comma_ then French_comma_ Spanisha and Chinese.
The worst think is when I do not have any clean clothes for work. The other day I had to wear my yoga pants because I forgot to do the laundry.
Yeah it is a telephone job so we have a relaxed dress code. But I don't like showing up with such revealing pants.
My girlfriend is the only girl on her speech team. She'll be gone with her team for 2 weeks
I'm worried the guys will try something_comma_ but I totally trust her.
There was a girl at the park today doing flips and a cartwheel. It was so crazy!
Yeah_comma_ she was like a kangaroo. She was bouncing around flipping and twirling_comma_ making it look easy.
I'm going camping next weekend. I heard there are making camping spots_comma_ so we won't have to sleep in our cars this time around.
What was that?
I saw a man staring at my girlfriend in the restaurant.
I punched him in the face_comma_ of course. I was furious.
My friend got into a really bad car accident. I'm so glad she's ok
It definitely gave her a scare. Goes to show you could be a very careful driver_comma_ but accidents can happen since you're not the only one on the road.
I am so nervous about the certification test I have to take for my job. I am worried I won't pass it.
I studied so much but I just know the questions will be about something I forget. Oh well_comma_ guess I will just try my best.
I'm going to China to a meeting for work. I've never been without my coworkers for these kinds of things.
In 2 weeks. I'm excited to see China but gotta focus on work.
My dog pooped on the rug yesterday. I was so peeved.
I do too! Almost considered giving her away because I was so mad.
i was sad i couldnte eat my favorite dish
cheese enchiladas
I got a nice shock the other day when my friends took me out to celebrate my birthday. I wasn't expecting for them to remember.
To my favorite Greek restaurant. They also gave me some nice gifts. I have the best friends!
I couldn't believe my eyes when my favorite aunt pulled up to get me from school.
yes we went to go see the first harry potter movie ever
I've been exercising for months and I lost 10 pounds. I feel great!
Yes I think so! I just bought some new clothes and I feel like a million bucks. 
I was devastated when my pet gerbil Gary passed away recently. I loved Gary so much!
Well I want to but I am afraid I will still miss Gary. We had such a great time together.
My coworker went into labor_comma_ and we somehow all brought a baby into the world
Yea. It was overwhelming but in a good way. And yea_comma_ guess we will all carry this special bond for the rest of their lives now.
I booked an AirBnB for our vacation this week. We just got here_comma_ and they forgot to mention a little detail about having a cat. My spouse and I are both very allergic to cats... We can't stay here now! And yet we're getting charged for cancelling_comma_ and we have to find a new hotel.
Yeah_comma_ something like that. Really not looking forward to dealing with that while I'm vacation_comma_ but I have to get it done sooner rather than later. They didn't even seem that remorseful about it_comma_ either. Like it was more our problem. How are cat allergies a surprise thing to people who are trying to be in the hospitality industry? Dumb
I was chatting with this girl who I thought liked me_comma_ but she thought she was texting my friend.
Nah. When she said my friend's name_comma_ I told her she was texting the wrong person.
My dog pooped all over my head yesterday. Smelled kinda gross and I was quite disgusted.
I have no idea. Maybe he was irked about the food I put out for him the other day.
My emu ran away last night. I was quite distraught.
Me too! She was such a darling bird. I'm not sure why she would run away so swiftly.
My spilled soda on my laptop. After a day of not using my laptop_comma_ thank god it turned back on.
I was really stressed out_comma_ because I had information with a lot of money on it.
My son spoke his first word yesterday.
I know! I was so hyped! He said "fart"!
i saw a sad kid at the store and bought him a candy to cheer him up
yes it did...made his day
My friends didn't show up for bowling last night.
Well_comma_ wasn't really the dog's fault. It was my friends' fault that they didn't show up.
i went to work the other day_comma_ and saw a mountain of pallets i had to open but i was confident i could finish
i finished everything _comma_ my managers were very impressed 
i just opened my whataburger bag when my wife reached for my fries
its great_comma_  but i cant believe she eats after me every time.
I ate 10 Big Macs the other day. Felt so bad thinking about all those starving children in Africa.
Only ten! Next I will try to gobble up 20. I think I can do it after today.
I arrived in San Diego yesterday. Felt so nice relaxing under a palm tree.
I am! I love seeing animals.
I suffered from such terrible acne when I was younger that thankfully_comma_ I rarely ever have when I started college.
Well_comma_ I have some scars but at least I don't have acne anymore.
My friends threw me a huge surprise party the other day.
It was! I received so many nice gifts. I was so shocked and so happy.
I got a call from the animal shelter_comma_ and they found my dog! She went missing on Friday
Yes_comma_ it is. I'm so relieved!
i am very confident i got this new job

Friends threw me a surprise party yesterday.

My nephew starts football this year in 9th grade!
Yeah I'm pumped!  I can't wait to go to some of his games!
Sure will!  I hope they win every game!
My best friend always interrupts me when I talk.
I would probably get interrupted.  It is so irritating!
After working at my job for over 2 decades_comma_ they're closing down.
Not yet. I'm just too sad.
My dog returned home after running away today.
It was! I was so happy. I thought I would lose him forever.
Went to the bowling all by myself yesterday. It was quite lonely.
Naw_comma_ my friends ditched me last night. It was a horrible night.
I am awaiting the decision for the new credit card with Chase that I have applied couple of days ago. I really need it
I have some outstanding debts from other cards. I want to transfer them to this new card to get advantage of 0% APR for another 15 month
I've been married to my wife for 20 years. I couldn't ask for a more happy life.
Thank you so much. We've seen so many people break up_comma_ and we vowed to work on our relationship.
There's a new computer cafe about to open up near me. Would love to make some new gaming friends
Neither did I_comma_ but they're gradually opening up.
I had a physics test today.
I did really well! I studied all week and never felt so prepared in my life.
My dog crapped on the rug. 
Oh_comma_ believe me it did. It's still sitting there from a few weeks ago because I don't have the courage to pick it up. I'm waiting for her to clean her mess up herself.
Had a great weekend out on the lake!
It's called sportsmans lake near where I live.  It was a really nice relaxing weekend!
Yeah you should go there!  Or any lake/camping area near where you live.  You would have a great time too!
I'm going to building a gaming pc. This is my first time
I've got a friend who's gonna help me out. Hopefully_comma_ I don't give her too much trouble teaching me.
I once kept a notebook in which I wrote down how my friends would die.
Actually_comma_ it's a concept from the anime "deathnote". Anyway_comma_ I was only 12 and copying a TV show_comma_ but my parents found it and thought I was troubled!
I lied to my friend today
I know its bad_comma_ but I went out eith some new friends who probably wouldn't get her like I do
I don't want to be friend with them either so I guess its okay.
My co-worker returned 20 bucks to me the other day after I lost it.
He found it a couple of feet from my cubicle. I am so glad since I need it to buy doritos and mountain dew.
There is a co-worker who frequently asks me to help him with his tasks. He is very incompetent and i can't understand how he was hired
I think all the blame lies on supervisors who hire such incompetent people who only hinder the work performance and pace
i used to collect spawn comics _comma_ one time i got home and saw all my comics torn up _comma_ it was so mad 
yes my baby sister _comma_ she was like 3 years old 
I went to the post office earlier and it was closed.
I was so mad I didn't get there earlier.
One pleasant morning I saw the new roses blossom in my garden.
yeah_comma_ I just planted that plant a week before!
I am watching old episodes of game of thrones right now
I am the biggest fan. I can't wait til the last season. This ummer was so boring
I know. But its going to be good
Smelling the pollen in the summer air brings me back to when I got my first kiss.
It is! Brings me back to the good ole days when love was sweet and tender.
A group of pigeons was stalking me the other day.
We don't have one_comma_ I was so terrified.
Once I studied a lot for the SAT because I needed to make sure I got at least a 2000.
I studied so much to take it and do well to ensure that I would get a scholarship. By the time I took it_comma_ it felt very familiar.
In the end I got a 2100 and got that scholarship. But I dropped out of that university anyway!
Me and my cousin just reconnected
Well she moved away to college and didnt come back after graduating. 
Yes. very. we are the closest in age. We see each other when she comes to town but we had a 6 hour conversation on the phone today and it was like the old days
IT is. especially with family
I am so upset with my children
They were supposed to clean while I was gone today and I came home to a big mess
I think I will do that tomorrow
I took out the trash today and the bag burst all over me. I knew I shouldn't have kept 50 pounds of ramen sitting in the fridge for 2 months.
I am a poor college student and needed to eat the leftovers. Thought it would stay good for all eternity. Guess it doesn't when it's cooked.
Two more days and it is on!
Kid is in school. Pre-K. I wish I could have a day party lol
no black olices and I am so there
I ate 50 pounds of ramen the other day. Never felt so bad for all the college kids that gazed on in envy and horror.
Nope! Well_comma_ I suppose they can_comma_ but not as much as I. I am the Ramen King and impose a stiff ramen tax for every ramen meal consumed by all poor college students.
I love cron dogs
I didnt buy the one I had today. IT was pork and I could tell. It was terrible
Pork hot dogs are the worst. I gave it to my daughter. She didnt care lol

I can't believe that I stole food from the soup kitchen.
Yes but I should not of stolen the food_comma_ that was wrong of me.

I'm so scared!
I'm going to ride roller coasters this weekend!
I've never been on one!  I'm not sure if it will be fun or not.
I feel sorry for the kid in my street.
Her mother beaten up severely. That's why she cried that much. 
None of my friends laughed at the joke I made yesterday.
It was indeed. I never felt so embarrassed in my life. I knew I shouldn't have told it then.
My dog took a fat ole dookey on my prized family heirloom.
Nope. I put him six feet under. That heirloom was worth over 10 million dollars. Never been so disappointed in him in my life.
I am going to Six Flags tomorrow!

Motorist scratched my car in the road today.
Yeah_comma_ I filed a complaint. I enraged on him.

He's pretty shy and also because he is just not great with women overall. 
My dad gave me this necklace way back in the day and it is so cool. I wear it every day.
Eh he was less than awesome in some cases_comma_ but he is still my dad.

I was shocked when i got invited on a random trip
happy_comma_ i didnt expect it tho
Romance movies bring me back to my youthful days
I think about about young love and how innocent and youthful I was then. Life always seemed to have more potential and hope.
I always have this feeling that someone or something is always behind me
It terrifies me and am not sure if there is actually some spirit or entity there.
I let my teenage son borrow my car and he crashed it!
Yes_comma_ but he destroyed my BMW i8_comma_ which I had saved for years to buy!

I am so proud of my mother
She raised us 3 kids by herself.  Shes old now but she makes good money and bought her own house.
Yeah she is.  I'm so thankful for her! 
I cheated on a test last semester and feel bad about it
i was worried i might not pass and got scared
I have hope for the human race even though its in its nature to destroy itself
Seeing the world today disheartens me but I feel hope. At least I must have hope.
My father bought me a new car_comma_ despite saying the day before that he would not buy it for me!
yea I was so surprised! He got me a Mazda! 
I was totally freaking out the other day after I watched a scary movie!

I really wish I had a car_comma_ especially seeing one of my friends that has three.
Especially since he didn't pay a dime for any of them.
I really wanted to get an A in this computer science class but hey I got a B so that's fine.
I hope so_comma_ I just really need to learn how to get better at it since it is my major.
I get embarrassed very easily
Theres loads. Its just being around people. You see_comma_ I'm a very shy person and have always been. For example when somebody laughs_comma_ that triggers it.
I feel guilty as a parent because I don't like to part in a lot of my children's school activities

a software engineer. I am so excited to be making so much more money!
I was really young and didn't know any better so I stole this item that I really wanted and felt bad afterward.
I've already done that but I just think it is weird how I felt guilt right after this.
I am a unhappy that there is nothing I could do to help
I had very little and a neighbour was asking me to help him pay his rent
I am a huge fan of sharks_comma_ and I am thrilled to go to the new shark film coming out!
Awesome! The movie looks quite fun and have some good effects.
Looking at how many friends my friend has and the fact that he has a girlfriend is kinda depressing and envious sometimes.
I would take any of those but I have only some friends and no girlfriend.
I stubbed my toe today and i was so annoyed
yea it didnt but it was a pain
I often feel jealous of my spouse.
I know she's faithful to me but have this niggling doubt within me when she talks to other guys.
I knew nearly no one in college my first year and had no roommate
yea but im introverted so its hard
I watched a horror movie yesterday.
No I scared and become petrified for  a moment.
i know i am going to get the new job!

Playing with my children makes me so happy!

I am overcome by joy when I'm with my son's
They are 8_comma_ 10_comma_ 12. They are the whole meaning of my existence.

I have to go back to school and leave all my friends in 2 weeks time
yea i know but its kind of depressing i wont be able to see them after
Hi_comma_ so I let my cousin babysit my infant yesterday.

I get disgusted anytime I see people treat animals badly
I have just joined an advocacy group that is enlightening people about how they should treat animals so I am hoping thing will change

Christmas is coming I can't wait for the joyous celebrations ahead
It's the best time to gather around my family from far and wide
My parents were able to pay for me to attend college_comma_ however I feel bad for those who were not lucky enough to be born into those circumstances
That's fair_comma_ just feels kind of unfair that some people are born into better circumstances. Then again_comma_ I guess life isn't fair.
I feel disgusted when I see or smell any form of thing with bad odour.
I know_comma_ I think I might have a phobia or something. It really puts me off.
My girlfriend (ex now) really bs'ed me since she said that she wasn't ready for a relationship but then she had another boyfriend right after she broke up with me.
It really is_comma_ it made me feel so dumb for trusting her.
i hope i get this new job
a general worker_comma_ but i dont feel confident about it.
I was surprised one day I scratched a lotto ticket to find out I had won £100.
I was in shock as I've never won anything before. I took the money home and gave it to my wife for the house shopping.
Ugh some guy in a truck cut me off twice on the interstate yesterday.
Yea and I am so jealous that he drives around in it so recklessly! 
I really felt confident that I could trust and love this girl that I used to date.
It didn't turn out well since she lied to me_comma_ even though I really thought she was truthful.
I am looking forward to my job interview tomorrow. I know I will get it.
Thanks but I won't need it.
I'm somebody that needs to always have everything organised and prepared.
I can never do anything or go anywhere unless I know all the steps needed and have everything set out.
My friend bought a car that I have been waiting to buy for years now!
Yea_comma_ I am quite jealous of him that he rides around in and his dad bought it for him.

Uni is starting up soon and im nervous
well a new semester is always intimidating
The banks are a good place to keep my money

I'm not sure but I always feel that people have an ulterior motive.
I was on a trip and fell asleep while driving. When I woke up there was an 18 wheeler stopped in front of me
I barely stopped in time. My heart felt like it was beating a hundred miles an hour.
The way interest rates are these days_comma_ i'm so afraid to go get a car loan
I intend to fix my dad's old Chevrolet covet pending when I am buoyant enough to pay for a new car
Small talk just annoys me
Theres no real meaning to it and most times they'd rather not even be there talking to you in the first place. 
I got a little upset when my friend canceled on my last weekend_comma_ I was looking forward to hanging
No thats what made it worse to me
I don't feel that people are very trust worthy.
I feel that people are always looking out for their own interests and even when they trying to help you_comma_ they are in it for their own gain.
I like my new manager. He is so kind and a good listener. I feel that I can trust him with any issue that I have.
I hate that too. Most of the managers are like that. They never listen and they can be rude.
I let my coworker in on a secret project and he helped me with it!
Yep_comma_ it helped that I felt trusting of him. So he performed well.
My sister bought tickets for my Mom and I to go to a concert. I wasn't expecting this but was quite pleased

She was drinking
How can I trust again when I have ben cheated on thrice
Yes I learnt my lessons
After I moved out of state I lost contact with a very good friend. When they tried to reconnect I felt bad about not staying in touch.
My guilt over this kept us apart for awhile. But because she is such a kind person she didn't give up and we are as close as we were.
I could not wait to go to the amusement park last week
It was so much fun
Last week_comma_ I saw a toddler taking dirt from the floor and putting it in his month. His mom was not paying attention. It is so bad to see.

Not when it's the dentist_comma_ I'd rather be at work! But my job is an easy one_comma_ so.
Oh! That's a good idea_comma_ maybe I should try to sweet talk my boss for the rest of the day off!
I bought a new laptop with my first salary.

"I was offered a job and wasn't sure if I should take it or not. There were a lot of variables in play.
Not really. I was just trying to move into a better position.
I was impressed with a speaker at work last week. He really got to me

I have two kids and there aren't even words to describe how eager you get to meet your baby for the first time in the last few weeks of pregnancy!
For my first it was because I didn't know what to expect_comma_ but for my second is was more exciting than anything.
My uncle was rushed to the hospital and has been there for many days now.
I dont think so. I feel sad knowing that his days are numbered.
I really believe the man I like will be asking me on a date soon.
He's been flirting with me quite a bit_comma_ I think he's just working up the nerve. He's also been mentioning how he needs to take me water skiing sometime since I've never done it and he loves it.
I cannot wait for the weekend. I get to see some old friends
Yeah its going to be fun
What I saw was not in my contract 
Thanks

I am not sure
I am thankful to have some time to relax today
I really do. I might take a nap.

I arrived at work and my office had a cake and balloons for my birthday. I want expecting anything because my birthday wasnt until Sunday.
It did make me feel nice. They really got me though. I had no idea they were doing that.
so i'm trying to participate in a bodybuilding contest. I was working really hard to get fit and i really think i can win
It depends on what i'm doing cardio or weight lifting. Usually 2-3 hours and i rest on saturday
I went to make a sandwich one day and the entire laof of bread was covered in mold!
I was gagging and had to get some fresh air
I am patiently waiting to hear back from a recent job interview
It went well_comma_ but you know that feeling you get in your stomach where it could go either way?
harvey weinstein made such great movies until he ruined it
too much to name
I wish I could afford all the material items people have around me
Fancy cars_comma_ clothes_comma_ and just peace of mind to swipe a card and not have stress
I'm looking forward to next year. My finances will be straightened out by then.
No_comma_ it's been real tough_comma_ and it still is. I'm trying not to get evicted and not sure if I'll make it or not.
A co-worker got a promotion over me
me 
It was kinda bullshit. Everyone things the guy is kinda dumb but_comma_ goign to lunch with your hiring manager 3 times a week has its perks.
I'm thinking its time for a new job.
So last weekend me and my girlfriend got into a fight. Luckily I have great friends to talk to and be there for me.
We did but I was still upset. My friends took me out for dinner and helped talk through it. Im just happy I have close friends like that.
it is always better to get what you deserve .. how do you  feel about this
of course.. i felt it discouraging in some way.. 
I've been feeling really bad about how far I've gotten behind on my bills.
I don't know. I'm losing sleep over it and nervous every day. I may get evicted.
my cat pee sometimes on my bed and i hate it because the smell is so hard to remove
no shes not
So i feel very horrible because i lied to my wife the other day
She asked me not to give our baby anything sugary before going to sleep and she went to take a shower and my son really wanted the cookie i was eating so i gave it to him. he had hard time falling asleep
I have a job interview scheduled for Friday. I really want the job. It is making me so nervous.
Its for a financial analyst position. Ive been pacing around like crazy.
Hi_comma_ I am feeling bad today.
I found a wallet on the ground and just took the money from it and left it there.
There was like 500 in there! I just didn't feel like messing around with it.
I keep a picture of my late great grandmother in my wallet at all times
I do_comma_ she was really special to me
I was checking mail everyday to see if I had won the contest
Nothing yet_comma_ the suspense is killing me!
I'm very worried that I'm not going to make an important goal.
Unfortunately no. There's no help. There's never any help.
My kids broke a family heirloom of mine recently and it made me so angry.
It's not salvageable. I'm still mad.
Yes but I think I came across as more mad so I don't think they took me seriously.
I finally got to go on vacation recently. I've been doing a lot of work recently so it was nice to get a relief.
The Bahamas.
I knew for a fact I posted the highest score in the bowling match
Just about 3 years
I got a promotion at work today!
4 yers
Thanks will do!
I've been working a lot this year.
Nope_comma_ I've been working a lot_comma_ but earning very little. BTW no change is possible.
I am very positive about the democrats in November
Good for you_comma_ less stress in your life
I accidentally sent a text about my friend to that friend instead of my cousin who I meant to send it to! It wasn't mean but it wasn't necessarily nice either. I feel bad.
No reply... I think shes just going to pretend it never happened_comma_ which is good with me! 
Hi I am so mad at my friend.
They done bought this dress. The only dress that I wanted when we when on a shopping trip.
Yes!
I was a bit taken back when I had to move out of my parents house
I relied on them for everything_comma_ I was scared to move out
I am excited about today my friend
I studied so long for my test and now I am ready
I had a good time with my family at the county fair last night.
No_comma_ but we rode some rides and listened to music.
My brothers baseball skills always wowed me
Since he was 4 years old
When my best friend passed away I was devasted
Just last week
I have always been considerate of my relationship with my wife_comma_ I would never cheat
15  years_comma_ its a struggle sometimes_comma_ but in the end it is worth it
Someone keyed my truck in a restaraunt parking lot last night
They didn't have it on camera.
Yes but_comma_ i'm still pretty upset.
I found out my group of friends went to the beach last weekend and did not invite me for some reason. I don't really know why though?
I dont know how to_comma_ Im not really a confrontational person. What do you suggest?
My son started walking when he was nine months old
He was so cute.  Very wobbly.
Not the very first time_comma_ but I got many recordings later.  His grandparents live in other states.
I remember when me and my brother used to play video games together. nintendo and stuff.. it was so much fun. i miss those times
i've never heard of this game. i loved playing mario and contra
I always think about my childhood and the good times I had with friends
You dont know how good you had it until its gone
I think I have to work too hard for what I'm paid.
That's not really an option for me.
I used to take gymnastics lessons_comma_ where the instructor would spot or make sure that we didn't fall when we tried to do new tricks. Thank god they were there because I wouldnt be alive from hitting my head when falling!
Yeah! You cant really learn how to flip off a bar or beam if you dont try and you dont get hurt while trying! lol
I am scared of Trump. He is on his way to create a civil war in the USA.
Because Trump is a liar_comma_ egomaniac and manipulative lunatic
I'm annoyed that I don't earn more.
I guess we'll just have to hang in there and do the best we can. Keep your eyes open for opportunities.
I'm kind of sad my little boy is growing up so fast and starting Kindergarten next week.
Yes and I'll get a break during the day also!
Oh most definitely. My daughter also got accepted into Head Start so it will be just me and my work.
Yes they are growing up fast!
I just got new neighbors who let their dog bark at all hours of the night.
Not yet.  I found that his dog went to the bathroom in my yard too.
My best friend came over and cleaned my entire house while I was sick with the flu. 
She is the best. I did feel better after that.
I have been working so hard on my job!
Yes maybe I will receive the promotion.
Traffic was unusually bad on the way to work this morning.
For basically no reason either... atleast as far as I could tell.
I was on the alternate route.
so i went to the gym the other day and i was using a traidmill and somebody told me "get off the traidmill fat ***"
i was so furious! I'm not even that fat! that was so mean
I've been working out for 2 months now and I finally started losing some weight so I'm hopeful I'll see lots of results soon.
So far about 10 pounds and 2% body fat.
Thank you. I plan on it!
I like to be trusting with my family. It makes life easier that way.
Of course_comma_ I'm speaking of my wife and kids. My parents framed me for their crimes and I ended up in prison for it.
I start a new job tomorrrow. I'm a little nervous.
I think I'll be fine. Just pre start butterflies.
I'm sure you're right.
My boyfriend kept me up all night playing video games
It's really inconsiderate. Gets on my nerves.
I had a big final exam that I studied really hard for. I passed with an A
I did. I even ended up with a 4.0 for the whole semester. I was very happy I was able to achieve that.
I have a sick dog in my house.
Yes_comma_ but I am awaiting a friend. They are bringing me the right medicine to help my pet.
I'm looking forward to my finances getting better next year.
It should be about a 20-25% increase.
I was sitting on my couch the other day_comma_ when my two year old came out of nowhere_comma_ and threw my phone at my head. It hurt really bad.
Sometimes he is just trying to be helpful_comma_ and hand me things.  I think sometimes he just gets too excited to be helpful_comma_ and clocks me in the face.
I don't know how many times I'm going to have to tell him not to throw things though!
One night I came home and caught my wife sleeping with my best friend
I was more angry at my wife
I got a $20 gift card from the place I work at today.
It was indeed. I'm happy.
I think I'll do that.
I will be getting paid today!
Yes_comma_ and I will be getting much money. It is a bonus check!
Yes_comma_ I will buy some new clothing!
My cat won't leave me alone
I literally fed him 20 minutes ago. I can't figure out what he wants_comma_ but he's so clingy
My childhood cat died the year after I left home for college.
He was pretty old_comma_ about 15 years.
I was at dinner the other night and spilled my drink all over myself.
no_comma_ it was a clear drink. But get this: I did it AGAIN after they brought me a new one!!
My boss passed me over for promotion and instead went with my coworker
Nope. He just tends to suck up and make it seem like he had all the ideas. He doesn't deserve it_comma_ and everyone hates him
I was feeling very hungry earlier today.
Yes and now I also have much food in front of me that is extra. I don't want any of it right now.
I can't wait to be reunited with my family_comma_ the anxiety of this is killing me 
Yes I am :) I will be meeting them next weekend_comma_ I have been in prison for 2 years now I am getting released next saturday
My brother broke his leg a few months ago_comma_ and I took care of him to make sure he was okay. 
He is almost healed up_comma_ but it was nice to take care of him to spend more time together. We usually dont get along. 
My two daughters are both musicians.
I am very proud of both of them. One is a violinist and the other a pianist.
I am more than ready for my vacation to Europe.
First Italy_comma_ then Spain and France
I had a scare while in my yard a few days ago.
I walked up on a snake.
Last Halloween I was nervous to go out at night.
No_comma_ I decided my safety was more important than going out
I was so happy for my son when he won the state championship for tennis
He was working hard for years.
We had a family get together full of contests_comma_ and my sister won but I wish I would have won. 
I am happy for her_comma_ but I really wish I would have won. 
All my friends got to go on vacation_comma_ but I'm stuck here doing work because I have a tight job deadline
Maybe_comma_ but I'm not sure when another opportunity like this will come. It really gets me down
I walked to school one day.
No worse_comma_ I walked in with two different shoes on
I spent all day yesterday waiting for my cable guy to show up as expected.  It never happened.  
What really ticks me off_comma_ is they did not even bother to call and say they were not going to show up
I was sad when I didnt earn the promotion.
How long will it take though?
I had a huge craving for ice cream the other day but I never got any.
I really like chocolate but I didn't make it to the store in time and they were already closed. 
When I got to my job_comma_ I was fired without cause.
No I am still looking for a job_comma_ I am so angry!
I was watching my son for the second day in a row_comma_ and I realized I needed more interaction with adults.
Yeah that's a pretty good idea.  I can end up getting a little depressed when all I do is clean up toys all day.
good advice!
I was anticipating the first day of school for a few days
It is for me_comma_ first day at high school!
I've always been loyal to my wife and children above all else.
Yes_comma_ it is.
I saw a cochroach in my living room last night.
I saw a cochroach in my living room last night.
Wow it just did something strange. You got two messages in without me saying anything.   No clue what happened there.
I was terrified to walk home from the bar one night. 
There were gunshots nearby so I just ran home as fast as I could
I had my car catch on fire while driving! 
Pulled over as fast as I could and jumped out. It was intense. 
I got first place in the karaoke contest last weekend.
There was_comma_ a free round of beer! There was a lot of talent there so I was surprised I won!
My brother recently told me that once_comma_ when we were kids_comma_ he spit in my orange juice and let me drink it.
He kept that a secret for like 15 years so who knows what I'll find out next lol
I went to the county fair last night.
We listened to some music_comma_ rode a few rides_comma_ and viewed the exhibits.
I found out that my storage unit burned down over the weekend.  I lost several items.
Yes_comma_ but the things that were lost were keepsakes and momentos.  Very difficult to replace those items.  
I am so relieved that president Trump won the election.
More like I hate Hillary Clinton.She is lying cheater.
I'm glad it's almost fall now.
Fall is my favorite time of year.
One of my bestfriends was involved in a car accident that ended up being extremely bad. 
Yeah all of them were injured extremely_comma_ and his gf was actually killed in the passenger seat. 
My cousin won $5000"
I was. I could really use $5000 my self too.
Haha_comma_ I doubt it.  Not even gonna ask.  That would be innapropriate.
My mother passed away recently and it was a really hard time. When I returned to work my coworkers got me flowers and made me feel welcome.
Its getting better now. Im just glad to know that some people have my back. It was very nice of them and Ill forever be thankful.
I found my old baby blanket when i was cleaning out my closet. 
It was a super flashback!!! I loved it. 
I feel so bad about myself
I vote on Trump for president and I regret deeply.
I recently applied for a new position at a higher paying company and they called me for an interview!
Yes! I am really wishing to get hired there!
I am getting ready for an upcoming economy crisis in the USA 
I do not know if is gonna be as big as the 2008 crisis.
Well my wife just quit her job_comma_ but if this new endeavor works out_comma_ we'll be better off in the long run.
Well she's going to make her own private practice_comma_ but it takes a while to build clients_comma_ so we're living pretty minimally right now.
I do_comma_ and we're getting along all right with my salary.  But we aren't saving fo rthe future or anything at the moment.
I always feel like myself from the past when I drive my old truck.
1968 chevrolet
Once I found a ten dollar bill on the ground.
It was at a time I really needed it_comma_ too!  I spent it on food
Hi friend_comma_ I recently went on a fishing trip.
I do all kinds of fishing. I have never done the sea fishing though.
My neighbor lets her cats use the bathroom outside_comma_ in my yard. Its gross. 
I have but she doesnt seem to mind at all. It just smells gross. 
Last week my wife and I almost walked into a store where a shooting had taken place.
It was definitely scary. I carry as well_comma_ but not on that day. I'm glad we were okay.
when we were struggling financially we told our pastor and our church gave us some food and money. i don't know what we would do without them and their help
yes! I just got a new job. our money is tight right now but at least we can pay the bills and buy food
I live in a town that has several major highways. The other day I passed an awful accident where a car was mutilated beyond recognition and it was do to the carelessness of someone speeding onto the on ramp of the highway and not watching the traffic coming as they entered it. It made me angry.
Well there was a body covered with a sheet beside the car and the entire highway was blocked off on that side because the Medical Examiner had not arrived yet.
My friend bragged too much about being good at FIFA. We played a round against each other and I beat him very badly at it
Indeed. It was important for me to put him in his place. It was a very valuable lesson learned for him
I wanted to hold out and see if I got a bonus.
I did_comma_ the family was able to take a vacation with it
I've had an uneasy feeling lately and I really don't know why.
Yes_comma_ I have been pretty stressed lately.
I was praying to god to help out our family
My son was severly ill
I was hoping to get my car in the body shop this week but I still have not heard from my insurance company.
They have always been very responsive but this time they have me aggravated.
I told a secret to my friend.
A fun secret_comma_ but I needed to be sure he could keep it
I researched for weeks for my paper.
It did only because I worked hard on it
I found out that I had to cancel my vacation.  I am pretty bummed.
I hope so.  My friend had to back out at the last minute_comma_ so my plans had to change. 
I am very disappointed in myself. I failed my driving test today for the second time. Can't get a car as i need a license
At least a week. The hardest part is parallel parking where i always touch the yellow bars slightly with the back bump of the car
I broke my new phone yesterday.
No and I was very upset!
I am just waiting for my next vacations
I am going to Brazil to have the time of my life.
I just started seeing this girl and I saw a red flag. Not sure if I should distance myself or keep seeing her.
Yea I think she was just having a bad day.
I have a big test coming up.
Its for college. If I don't pass it is going to affect my graduation negatively
I'm happy to have an old friend that understands me.
Yes_comma_ and we have the same checkered past too.
My husband and I have been married for 7 years and I've been faithful the whole tie.
That's good there hasn't been any  in your marriage in so long.
I totally agree for you. Marriage isn't easy.
Yep. I think people today don't take marriage as serious as it should be taken.
I am very satisfied with the way things are at work
Thanks buddy_comma_ being content is just a way of showing gratitude to the universe about all the good stuff I have being blessed with
Lightening hit my house and fried all of my appliances! ugh frustrating. 
I've been self conscious for a few years about myself.
Yes_comma_ I suppose that's true. But I feel that mine is somewhat worse.
Last week a couple days after getting groceries I was looking for my childs other shoe in the car. It was then that I discovered a carton of eggs that my fiance forgot to get out of the car with the rest of the groceries!!! I was soo grossed out.
It didn't even smell but I didn't look I just took to right to the trash! Ick!
I found a little baby cat today near my house.
Yes and I will name it Stray!
I'm a little uneasy about making it through the last half of the year.
I'm having a rough time financially.
Some person cut me off in traffic yesterday and almost caused me to wreck.
Yes_comma_ fortunately! I can't stand people who can't drive!
Gosh I hate it when I have to work on complicated parts in my boat engine_comma_ when my friend is helping me.
Nah I can do it myself_comma_ I just have to hope that my buddy doesn't do anything crazy when my hands are in between the hydraulic lines. 
Yeah I can fix the boat_comma_ I just need to be sure my help can handle their tasks appropriately!
Lightening hit my house and fried all of my appliances! ugh frustrating. 
Yeah I do_comma_ but it still sucks! What a pain in the rear.
Hi_comma_ I had a car crash today..
Yes_comma_ but my car is messed up now. :(
I am going to do scuba lessons in a couple weeks.  For some reason I am really nervous about it.
I hope so!  Drowning is the worst way to die in my opinion!
The other day I was watching a talk show and they started talking about how if you eat a big meal like dinner after 4 hours prior to going to bed_comma_ that it results in more rapid weight gain and hinders weight loss! I had never heard that before!
I suppose it makes sense because your not burning as much calories when laying in bed then you would be otherwise right?
My friend was telling me how she recently bought tickets to a music festival at a discount and she offered me to buy a ticket from her if I'm interested.
I don't think she will get in trouble because I won't report her_comma_ I will probably take her offer because it will be my first festival.
Hi_comma_ my friend is coming to visit me.
This week and they are very sad right now.
They had a wedding but then it got canceled..
I had a test at work the other day.  I wasn't really fretting it though.
Yeah I felt really prepared.  I knew going into it that I had done everything I needed to _comma_ and felt good about my abilities.
Thanks!  I ended up doing really well on it too!
I rode a roller coaster at the fair for the first time the other day.
Yes_comma_ it was an awful scary experience overall.
My friend is messaging me and it's annoying.
They are keeping on saying that I owe them all this money....
I am going on a vacation soon!
To some type of mountain area and going with my wife!
I lost my temper with my father and said some rude things I shouldnt have said when I was younger. 
I know I try not to but once you get older you realize it wasnt the nicest or brightest thing! 
It is such a gorgeous day outside today.  The problem is that I have no one to share it with.
I don't. We should plan something together then.  Lol.
You'll never guess what happened! I am so embarassed.
I got a call from my son's school.  The Vice Principal told me he pushed another kid and cursed in the lunch room!
He was! Just for one day.  But it suits him well_comma_ he missed "Field Day".
My daughter walked for the first time! 
I am very much so! Its amazing. 
Hi_comma_ you will never guess what happened to me at work.
My arch enemy done got the raise that I wanted. Can you believe that?
I was so afraid when my daughter was born. She came out with the cord around her neck. 
Yes luckily_comma_ the nurse scared me too because she kept saying shes not crying and she should be. 
I was recently looking through an old photo album and it made me feel strange.
It made me miss the past.
I am so upset about my current working situation!
The raise that was mine is now taken from my arch enemy of work!
I feel so at ease right now with life_comma_ finally after all the hecticness. 
for sure they really dont prepare you enough for it. 
This is the best week of work for me. I will be getting a raise!
Yep_comma_ mama always said: work hard for that chocolate!
lol_comma_ right!
My family went on a cruise without me. I couldnt get the time off work. :/ 
Yeah I am and it sucks. 
A couple years ago where I live we had Hurricane Matthew aiming directly towards us. I was so worried_comma_ I was glued to the TV until we lost power_comma_ then to the radio!
No I did not_comma_ we were not mandated to_comma_ but there was a voluntary evacuation in place and my neighbor left and asked us to watch her house. Her entire shed blew away leaving her lawnmower just sitting there in the middle of her yard.
We went to our county fair last night.
We did have a great time and it was so old fashioned.
The music was pleasing.
I was riding my bike the other day_comma_ and passed all these flies hovering over a mutilated armidillo.
Yeah it was pretty nasty.  Problem was I didn't even recognize what it was until I was right on top of it!
Lol exactly!
I cant wait to go shopping. I really need a new purse. 
Wherever they are the cheapest_comma_ but still of nice quality! I like a good deal. 
Best way to be! 
I just bought a boat for the river!
Yes and it is one of the best ones that money can even buy!
Thanks!
My friend recently moved far away and I have really been missing her.
I am in Connecticut and she is now in California. My boyfriends flew here here for my birthday without me knowing. I was not expecting that!
I'm happy that I can take care of my family's needs now better than I could in the past.
My income has increased_comma_ and it will again in February_comma_ so I'm looking forward to that.
I had to put my dog down at the vets due to a disease she had that wouldnt get better. It sucked. 
She was almost 8 years old. Not that old really. 
Yes she did. 
I just got the best boat ever!
It's Triton secret series of Master John of jon boats!
Thanks I will catch all the catfish with this one!
Yesterday I was unloading the dishwasher and I guess not paying enough attention and dropped one of my good mixing bowls that busted all over the floor. It took so long to clean up. I was so mad at myself.
Oh no just my attitude. And my poor bowl. 
I was driving down the interstate and a car almost hit me going 90 mph. 
I was and super upset! No blinker_comma_ didnt care_comma_ didnt even look! Kept right on going too 
Recently hired a second person to work with me and I am optimistic they will help as sell more cars
They do_comma_ plus we simply dont have enough people_comma_ so its a good fill in.
Someone at work stole my phone yesterday! 
I know_comma_ right? I can't stand the people there!
I have been craving ice cream for weeks and finally went to the store to get some only to find out they didnt have the kind I wanted! 
Chocolate peanut butter - haagen dazz brand. ( spelling probably wrong there! ) 
Well now I am deff going after work. 
The walk I was on today got a little dangerous at one point.
I almost stepped into a big hole! But luckily someone stopped me from walking!
So_comma_ I flew into San Diego this morning_comma_ and when I got here my car reservation was never processed by the car rental company. 
Needless to say_comma_ I am livid. I have been travelling for over 12 hours and I'm exhausted. When I got to the rental place and they gave me that news_comma_ I exploded in a fit of rage. They ended up giving me a car right away_comma_
Livid means you are really really angry!
I had an interview a few weeks ago_comma_ and I knew I was going to get it! I was really prepared. 
I read over the reviews on glassdoor and the typical questions they ask. 
My wife told me she had some news for me the other day_comma_ she wanted to tell me she was pregnant.
Yeah we weren't reallllyyy trying_comma_ so it definitely wasn't expected_comma_ but still good news!
That's a good point!
It's almost time for my daughters to be home from school. I hope they have had a nice day.
no_comma_ they've been in a week already.
I had just moved in and my neighbor asked to borrow my gate card real quick. I let her use it. 
I felt like she was a good person and just let her borrow it. She gave it back afterwards. 
I took my family out to the county fair last night.
We listened to some music_comma_ rode a few rides and saw the exhibits.
I wasn't expecting this_comma_ by when I woke up this morning on my birthday_comma_ my boyfriend informed me that he planned a trip to Califoria for us and that we are leaving today!
Same here! It was a wonderful idea_comma_ and very impromptu!
So_comma_ after 10 years of service at my job_comma_ they're going to lay me off.
The company is apparently downsizing...they say my name came up randomly. 
Got my kid a used car. I think it'll last her quite a while.
Yep. We did. Wife and I are concerned about getting tricked_comma_ but we're taking a leap of faith here.
I won tickets to see my favorite band in concert the other day!
It's a band called Say Anything_comma_ I've been a fan of theirs since 2006! 
I usually spend Saturdays with my parents since my Fiance works most Saturdays. Football season is coming up and my parents always get season tickets to the football games on Saturdays. It is really going to stink not having anything to do once that starts up again. 
Its hard with my 2 year old. Its almost impossible to do anything.
I'm pretty bummed out. The vet told me I have to put my dog down.
Well_comma_ he's small and he got bit by a chipmunk. Got some kind of incurable disease that makes me run around in circles constantly without breaking for food. He's going to waste away to nothing at this rate.
My friend got a huge scholarship last year
yea i was very happy for him
I have a wonderful husband and two sweet kids. I'm feeling so much better from a horrible autoimmune flare. Life is good!
Thanks.  I know life is perfect but its a journey and I'm satisfied with where I am right now.  
I got startled while walking in my yard a few days ago.
I walked up on a snake.
I once had to have teeth pulled_comma_ and I was given some crazy pill to take before coming to the appoinment because I hate dentists_comma_ and it made me act all funny. My mom video taped it and it is so funny but like stinks people saw me acting like a hooligan!
Yes it was! However_comma_ I cannot honestly say that I wouldn't do it to them. I certainly would not post it anywhere but I could see myself filming it
I just celebrated my sons 14th birthday and can't believe he's growing up so fast. How is a man in my house all of a sudden?
It is crazy and so weird when you have kids that are little and then everything changes so quickly.  I remember how he used to fit into a tiny sleeper!
I just returned from a trip to Canada_comma_ and I was so surprised by how friendly everyone was there!
It was a very pleasant surprise to me too! I had a wonderful time_comma_ the customer service was completely outstanding!
I've been a bit worried lately.
Money's been hard to come by for me lately.
Tomorrow_comma_ I'm going on my first cruise!
It will be for 14 days_comma_ I'm going to Europe! I've never been out of the country before!
I'm about to move this weekend to a new city. I have everything packed and ready to go and have already cleaned the new house.
I got a new job and have always wanted to move away from my hometown because its not that big.  I can't wait
My kids are so bad about bringing their dirty dishes to the sink and not rinsing them off.
They are to old for that. I don't have a dishwasher and have told them if they don't get it together they will be doing the dishes themselves.
i saw a car crash the other day on the road

We had some birthday cake from my husband's party this past weekend in the fridge_comma_ and I ate the last piece because I was craving chocolate like crazy! I feel so bad now.
I just thought about the fact that my hubby might want it instead of me since it was the last piece.  I guess I can make him another one!
My son gave his first flute recital last week. He did great and got a standing ovation.
He had some nerves but he practiced so well it was not that big of a deal. I was beaming the whole time!
I woke up in the night last night smelling an electrical burning sound!
yes! It was scary though! I walked all around trying to find the source
No. All I could tell was it was upstairs but then it went away.
i got home and my husband had mowed_comma_ cleaned_comma_ and got dinner ready
we had roasted potatoes with some grilled chicken.
haha chic-fil-a is so yummy though
I get anxious whenever I'm at the airport and I'm waiting in the security line and the plane is about to board.
I agree_comma_ seems like you have to plan to be there hours before it takes off.
I can't wait for the weekend!
I will finally get to go to a water park this summer on the weekend. 
I was speeding while on my way home from work and I got a ticket. I was only going like two miles over the speed limit!
No I was speeding_comma_ but its just stupid that I got a ticket when everyone else around me was speeding too. 
My wife took a real plunge the other day_comma_ she quit her job and decided to start a practice of her own!
It's a counseling practice_comma_ but yeah she quit her job to do it so I thought it was really cool she had the balls to do it!
Yeah I sure hope not literally... Otherwise she has some explaining to do.
I miss the days when I lived at home with my parents. I miss my mom's cooking and reading me bedtimes stories.
Of course. I like to remember when life was so simple. Now life is tough.
My Grandma just passed away. Its been a brutally tough time.
Thank you.  I know_comma_ she was the one I was the closest too.  She died soon after my Grandpa died so its been awful.  It feels surreal. Treasure them while they're here.
i made it to work early and was able to get ready before people started coming in
not really but at work i like to have time before everyone gets in there
it's hard to get anything done with coworkers around. 
Why should I not be jealous_comma_ how can a guy that is not educated any more than a masters degree holder
he did does not have a diploma just because he is experience :(
I was nervous going to the dmv. I hate going there
I just had to fill out paperwork
I was almost ran off of the interstate today!
some moron tried to get in my lane without looking!
It's almost date night
Nothing yet. Me and the hubby are gonns get some well deserved alone time.
It better. Babysitters are cheap.
I was glad when my dad retired. He deserved it
He is loving it
I usually keep only professional relationships at work.
I made a few friends this time. They heldped me through a tough time.
That's true too. 
i walked out of the house and heard a rustling in the brush and found a deer running up the hill
they are so majestic it's amazing
it makes me so worried for them getting so close to the road
My daughter is doing so well in school that she flew through 3rd grade a year early and is starting 4th grade next week. I'm amazing at how well she's doing!
She is a go getter but things seems to come easily to her which I'm thankful for.  I'm having trouble keeping up!
I just love seafood buffets
Seafood is expensive here. I love to eat loads of crab and lobster
I like crawfish too
I lost my pet turtle recently. He probably escaped my yard. I am so sad he is gone!
Yeah_comma_ I miss him terribly. I hope he has a good life!
I was not sure about the dmv. I did not want to go there
Yeah it was for sure
I am ready for the weekend_comma_ I get to go see my favorite band.
Yes_comma_ I got front row tickets. It is going to be epic.
My daughter decided to play waitress with her food and hold the plate over her head.
Well_comma_ there is spaghetti all over the carpet so how do you think?
I hope so. Carpet cleaning is expensive
I think I'll make that investment when the kids are older.
i was looking thru some old photo albums. it's so crazy to see how everyone has changed
the kids have grown so much
go to school. they are just older
i felt weird when i didnt have the money to pay for dinner
no my father in law had to pay for us
My boyfriend wants to have a 
a "talk" I think he wants to break up
I was thinking about that_comma_ but what if that's not it?
I am afraid of frogs. I know that is weird but they have always scared me.
I do thou like enjoy frog legs. 
My fiance works as a technician installing internet at peoples homes_comma_ and they are always tipping him. Often with food and it makes me nervous sometimes.
I mean he wont let me eat anything people give him but I wish he would just toss stuff_comma_ you never know what kind of people are out there. Especially if they are upset with the company he is working for. 
i couldnt wait for the birth of my twins
of course cost was always a thought.but the fact that there are 2 was a little overwhelming
I'm pretty hopeful this year for my college football team to place top 5!

School starts for me in a couple of weeks.
Yep. I am a junior this year
I have everything I need too. I have never been so ready
i am hoping to get out early from work on friday
i want to go camping for the weekend
I have a lot of faith in the community I live in; everyone seems like a good person.
I agree_comma_ that's why I favor smaller towns opposed to big cities. Just not my thing.
I just found out that my sister and her husband are going on a 15 day cruise. Its torture to hear!
I haven't been on a vacation in about 8 years.  I really want to go too! I'm excited for her but it does make me feel miserable when I think about it. Such is life though.
im 800 miles from my family and i miss them
mostly daily or at least once a week
it does a little
i am trying to work on it
I ordered food today and weirded out the delivery guy went I went downstairs to pick it up
I was still in my nightgown. I forgot lol
I was like a big t-shirt. At least I wasn't wearing lingerie lol
PRobably. I gave him a decent tip too
I'm really stoked for this weekend. I'll finally be able to get a new laptop after using my dinosaur for years.
Yeah I've been wanting on a while and now the chance presented itself. Should be a good weekend lol.
I'm thinking a Macbook Pro since that was my old one_comma_ but I'll make a final decision at the store I suppose.
My son counted all the way to thirty today
He is 3 but he doesn't talk much. He always stopped at ten but today he went all the way

Yes_comma_ no kids.  Nothing too crazy has happened in awhile.
Yes_comma_ when we are more financially stable.
My a/c went out the other day_comma_ and I knew I wasn't gonna be able to fix it.
Yeah for sure_comma_ but luckily my dad is the man_comma_ and he loves helping me_comma_ so he came over and did his thing.  Fixed it right up!
Yeah it's especially nice when they genuinely want to help too.
I'm jealous of people born with perfect healthy genetics.
They seem to be immune to sickness_comma_ that's like the greatest trait of them all!
Yes_comma_ unfortunately.
MY best friend said she was staying home last weekend.
She was lying. Someone tagged her in photos from a party. I don't know why she didnt invite me
Not yet. I think she should say something first.
when i heard my wife and twins were in a car accident i didnt know what to think
they were ok.i had no information at first
MY light bill was doubled last month.
I have no idea we went out of town twice. I am so mad
I am tomorrow. I think the guy didnt even read my meter
I recently moved to a new place and currently don't know many people_comma_ so it's a bummer.
Yeah_comma_ I have found one Starbucks so far. I guess I need to explore the area a bit more.
My sister and I used to chase the ice cream truck when we were kids.
I liked the strawberry shortcake creamsicle. I still buy them. They are too high on the truck now
IT is. 
i ordered pizza with my husband and it was totally underwhelming
it's like pizza hut undercooks their pizza now
we even went to pick it up so it wouldn't be cold
no. it was too late
I'm flying on a plane tomorrow. I hope it goes wheels up and wheels down with no trouble... But it's the first time I've flown_comma_ and I'm pretty sure any sign of turbulence is just going to make me want to hurl. Plus_comma_ I'm worried about getting lost in an airport!
Sorry about that. I'll keep it shorter. Nothing_comma_ was just trying to express how I'm feeling about things.
np. later.
i felt bad when i couldnt buy a gift my daughter wanted the other day
yes_comma_ i need to work harder i guess
Starting my first day as a kindergarten teacher soon. I have my supplies_comma_ my lesson plan_comma_ have asked all the experienced teachers for tips_comma_ have set up my classroom... Think I'm ready to start my career handling the future of our society. It's going to be nerve-wracking to start_comma_ though
Thanks! I appreciate that. We'll see. At least I'm trying to focus_comma_ and I care a lot_comma_ so that's a start. But I know it's going to take a while for me to not be awkward in the beginning. Going to try to incorporate as much humor as I can to lighten the mood.
I dropped my phone in the toilet.
No_comma_ it doesn't work.  I am so irritated with myself!
I was lonely on Monday. I was sick all day
Much much better
I am deathly afraid of rollercoasters
MY daughter loves theem. I end up standing in line with her and never getting on lol
Amusement parks are a waste of money for me lol
I really miss living in the city
MY friends are so far away now. We hardly ever see each other.
City isn't saf for the kids. It sucks
i was mad the other day when i saw someone had put a huge dent in my car door!
yea_comma_ i cant believe some people dont give a crap about other people's belongings
I took care of my cat this weekend_comma_ He was a little sick
I did and they fixed him up
My two-year-old niece is getting better and better with his manners. We had to pull him from his parents_comma_ and volunteered to take care of him_comma_ because they were failing as parents. But he's surprisingly picking up on how to have more appropriate_comma_ normalized behavior_comma_ and I'm happy about it
Yeah_comma_ we'll see how far it goes. I'm still worried for him_comma_ since he's had an incredible lack of socialization. But we'll do the best we can. It's just important to stay patient... because that's really hard right now.
You know_comma_ I really feel great about taking my certification boards.
Getting my certificate to be a Physician Assistant. 
That's awesome. I think boards are easy if you remember that they are always testing you on a simple concept_comma_ so any answer that seems like you'd have to overthink it is wrong.
I know_comma_ right!? Congratulations on your exam_comma_ as well.
MY kids were up all night. 
2. They were just giggling and then would pretend to be asleep when I went in their room. I was exhausted today
Ishould try that. They are 3 and 4
Thanks
I wish my husband didn't have to go on his business trip today.
He has to go to Chicago for business for a week. I'm gonna miss him.
I saw this guy eat a 3 lbs burger today for lunch and i was impressed
he went straight to the restroom :)
I am so blessed to be able to have a car.
I had to work hard for it_comma_ but now I can go where I want.
I knew I was going to pass my drivers test. I knew I would do well
I did pass it
I really like to learn and I'm so ready to go back to school. I can't wait for classes to start!
Physics. I'm in my senior year so I can really explore the complicated subjects now. 
When I got home today I realized someone had parked in my parking spot.

He is the sweetest and y kids love hime. Total opposite of my exes
Thanks. I hope it lasts forever

I got a sudden visit from a friend of mine from another country recently.

I'm drinking vodka lol
Oh not even after dinner?
I am so tired of tell my daughter the same thing over and over.
I don't know why she won't keep her room clean
I don't understand how it gets so messy every day though. Girls should be neat
When I was outside I saw a black cat cross the street. I am superstitious and am now scared something bad will happen to me.
Well I will have to be very careful when I do things. I don't want to get injured or anything like that.
I can't wait until December.
No_comma_ I love Christmas_comma_ but my son will be born.
I have court on thursday.
I got a speeding ticket. I can't pay it. 
Me too. I hate court
Strangely I was super excited to eat my pizza tonight. I am on keto..so any kind of food after fasting is exciting to me
It was a gluten free kind as I am intolerant too it. It was just pepperoni. Normally I would like pineapple or mushrooms though :) Carbs and cheese was GOOD!
The mosquitos are terrible this year. No matter what they keep buzzing around my head.
I've tried everything I could find on google and they still bite me. Maybe I just have yummy blood lol.
I have a nevus that has change shape. I am little bit afraid of what it could be. I will go see the doctor tomorrow.
I discover it today. I felt some anormal in that area then by touching I notice that skin was not normal.
i was glad to see i was able to get on time today
yea they keep us until we are done
I was envious when my brother got his new job. I kind of wanted it
It was a manager job
I had to spank my two-year-old niece today. He wasn't listening and kept doing the same mistake over and over_comma_ defying me. I don't like to be physical_comma_ and I'm sure others would look down on it_comma_ but I didn't feel like I had a choice.
Yeah_comma_ I didn't. I try to use it sparingly so that it has more meaning. But he's not even my own child_comma_ so it felt wrong in a way. And I also felt like I failed because I couldn't get through to him without doing it.
I finally got around to watching the Black Panther movie. It was a real let down for me I I don't get what all the hype was about.
I hope so.  I feel on the out because all my friends loved it so much.  It just felt too busy to me.
My little brother is about to enter high school in a week. Makes me remember the years I was in it. It wasn't all bad_comma_ but it definitely wasn't all good. I wouldn't mind re-living that period for a little bit though
I was a nerd and never went to those! But I liked the lack of responsibility_comma_ and how easy everything was. Classes weren't too hard for me. And I didn't have much trouble with bullying or any of that. I liked the breezy feeling of it all.
I got gas tonight because I didn't want to run out in the morning before work. I'm usually rushing around so it'll be nice not to have that worry tomorrow.
Yeah_comma_ plus the whole getting out in the heat or cold to pump gas sucks too.
I feed the birds that come to my home everyday
I hope so_comma_ too. I've been having to spread it on the grass though which is difficult for them to eat.
My neighbor just got a new car and it's gorgeous. I wish I could have a car that nice.
You have a point there. Maybe I should be happy with my old clunker after all lol
Every time my kids take a nap I do someting terrible.
I eat somethig sweet like ice cream. I don't let them have it lol. Its bad
you know what? it's freakin genius!
I saw a video of child abuse today and it reminded me of the abuse someone I know went through as a kid. 
It was actually good to hear some of it_comma_ it made me feel more compassionate to them..as I see how that could warp you as an adult.".
Thanks. I am..but it's no fun to be :)
I play the lottery sometimes here_comma_ and finally won a small amount. Not a big deal_comma_ but I was shocked it finally happened haha.
Yeah it's really demoralizing until you at least win something. A nice little bonus anyway. 
I hate waiting_comma_ especially on grades. 
I know_comma_ I try not to worry!
I was sad about the past this morning. I hate then when you wake up and remember a lot of bad things that happened over the past few years
If only- Lots of trauma the past year especially..That's not something that is easy to forgot or get over.
How can one stay married for 10 years without cheating?
Ok_comma_ I think I am just being scared and finding an excuse 
Wow. Thanks alot buddy I will remain faithful to my partner 
I had a terrible first day of juinor high
A girl purposely tripped me in the hallway in front of everyone.
yes. I get nervous for my daughter starting a new school because of that
i was happy to see that my dog found his way back home!
for 3 days
I am feeling better about the future off and on today. It's always a feeling I try to hold on too. 
Yes! For sure. It's easy to feel dark about the future_comma_ so any good feelings are welcome.".
I was happy when my brother moved home. I missed him
It really us
I told my frend something personal and she was so judgemental towards me
IT really hurt my feelings. She was never like that before
I don't know if we are friends anymore
I am going to eat nachos later.
Oh yes.  I can't wait to devour them!
I don't have a job currently. So today_comma_ I robbed an old lady. I feel bad about it.
Yes_comma_ I know. I feel really bad but I need to find money to be able to leave.
How cool is this? I won free ice cream for a year from my local creamery!
That is very nice. How is happened?
You are very lucky.
I gave up dieting a long time ago_comma_ and I'm far happier and losing weight slowly
Just an endless cycle of losing and gaining. I finally decided to just eat as healthy as possible without thinking about the weight.
I saw a guy picking his nose in his car a stop light the other day.
I would have but he ate it before I could get my window down and I couldn't yell over the gagging.
hahahahahahahaha_comma_ classic!
I cannot wait until October!
It is my anniversary month_comma_ and we always go to the mountains.
In Teneesee!
I had a taste for some pizza today so I asked my daughter to put one in the oven
Well you wouldn't like this pizza. She burned it terribly. I was so upset
We had hot dogs.
I was thankful my brother helped me move. It was needed
It really is
I stepped on my dog's tail accidentally earlier and I felt really bad about it.
No_comma_ only his feelings. I just wish I had a way to make him understand that I didn't mean to.
it upset me when i saw my food was taken out of the fridge at work today
nope.. it happens all the time at work
My friends went to a bar tonight and I didn't get to go.
I didn't have enough money to go out with them so I had to stay home by myself.
My mom brought me my favorite salad and cheesecake yesterday. 
I know right? She does those things all the time for me when she can. She's a great mom.
I'm entering a music contest with my friends. This is our first!
It's 9 limit_comma_ because we're 9 people.
Everyone is gone for the night. I haven't been alone at night in forever
Stay with my sister for a sleepover. Im a litlle scared. ITs so quiet
Every ittle noise is freaking me out. I will never get to sleep
I bought another pair of shoes today. 
Converse. I was getting school shoes for the kids and I just had to get a pair for myself. 
I know right!
I keep seeing everyone at the beach_comma_ I want to go to the beach!
I love the beach_comma_ too! We can only go once also!
I was sad when my cat passed away. He was so sick
They really are_comma_ I still miss her
My wife told yesterday that she doesn't love me anymore and she want a divorce. I felt totally destroyed.
We have been together for more than 10 years now.
My softball team just lost the season championship by 1 run in extra innings.  I am so disappointed.
Old men that can hardly run division.  It's basically all I have to look forward to after work everyday_comma_ so it's even harder to handle.
i cant wait to see if i got a raise on my next paycheck
no they make it a suprise!
I finally found a music streaming link that plays fairly new music and not just the same thing repeatedly.
Yea. Like what is the point of listening to the radio_comma_ if they're going to play the same song. I can do that on my own without the ads.
Our home was broken into right after we moved in.
I have a little_comma_ I am so cautious though. 
I had to try to start my old broken lawn mower today and it wouldn't start_comma_ it made me VERY angry about my nice one being stolen
No_comma_ but I couldn't believe it because although I am in a bad city..I have a fenced in yard..and they would've had to JUMP the fence and carry it over..and I have some BIG mean dogs that everyone is scared of..So it had to be someone who didn't know about my dogs...But I have a security light too..I haven't seen it at any pawn shops or for sale anywhere..it's been months..But boy do THIEVES make me SO ANGRY! I work HARD to have stuff and they just TAKE it!
There was some weird scraping noise at my window earlier.
I'm not! I'm hiding under my covers in case it's someone waiting to come in and kill me!
i had to send my plate back at the restaurant today
the chicken was still very pink in the middle
MY friend just got a new car.
A camaro. I want a new car. Mine is over 15 years old
Why is everyone getting new cars except me
I cried all night when I found out Trump won the election.
They were tears of joy_comma_ trust me if Clinton had won it would of been tears of fear.
i was upset when i saw a big dent in my car door
im gonna seek revenge for my door!
I was happy my dad got me a truck for school. It was a nice gesture
I am paying for that unfortunately
I always lie to my boyfriend about how much money I have.
I would rather him spend his money. I know thats bad
Really?
I got mad when I almost got evicted. My landlord is the worst
Its not the best
I have been getting everything ready to apply to grad school.
I am studying Counselor Education for school counseling.
My new dog who was starved is getting a bit on my nerves today. I am just a little cranky today and she is finally having energy and being a handful
Yes over a week ago. She was incredibly malnourished. She is sweet but she is being very naughty today. She is young and likely never got to enjoy life..she was exhausted after being malnourished.
Yesterday_comma_ I came home early and I discovered my wife cheating on me. I felt totally destroyed.
I left. I want her to leave but she said that it is also her home since we are married.
I keep seeing a little black and white kitty running around who is hungry. 
No_comma_ I help animals myself. They don't catch cats or take them here...And I wouldn't want them to anyway as they put them down. He won't let me catch him yet but I am trying!
Yes_comma_ but sometimes they get hit here_comma_ so that reminds me I need to get a trap. I really don't want another cat..I have to feed them further away because if they get in my yard- dogs could hurt them.
My stomach was feeling yucky today and I accidentally passed gas during the staff meeting!
I think they did. If they didn't hear it they definitely smelled it. 
MY ids still love going to school.
It so easy in the morning now. I know its not going to last though lol
Me too
I recently got a scrapbook from my brother of all of our old pics together. Brought back some good memories.
Yep_comma_ he made a copy of everything so I have a complete set now. 
it was disappointing when i didnt get the job i applied for 
yea im sure.. was kinda hoping it was my time
My family is gone on vacation without me and I don't like sleeping without anyone else in the house.
Yeah_comma_ especially when you haven't been alone for 15 years.
I can't wait until December_comma_ my son will be born.
Yes_comma_ we can't wait!!
I don't think I want to meet this person to purchase a couch off of Craigslist_comma_ something seems off about it.
That's a good idea but I feel a little sketch even doing that.
i was upset when i saw someone had taken my food from the fridge at work
nah.. im sure i never will.. people are sad.
Upset with my neighbor who used to like animals..and IDK if he is on drugs or has a mental illness but he acted like he was going to hit the dog 
The cops don't do anything here. They don't even come for gun shots half the night...It's the wild west here. I ran over and got her and he ran in his house like the loser he is.
My really good vaccuum cleaner broke last week! I was so bummed_comma_ but then my brother in law offered to fix it for me and I am so happy he did.
Mine is was like 200 dollars_comma_ not sure if thats cheap or not when it comes to vacuums. I dont know anything about them LOL. I dont want to buy a new one_comma_ hopefully he can fix it
Someone I know was nasty to me again after trying to build trust.
Oh man..you are speaking my language..I have wanted to run them over before lol- Some people are just SO horrible and say the most horrible things to hurt you.
This person unfortunately got many more..Because he has some mental illnesses and I have a lot of compassion..but when the compassion is gone..it's gone! I've never felt that way except towards child abusers etc before..Weird to feel that way about someone you love
I can just imagine what gets every so happy at Christmas
Yes_comma_ it's the only time we get to meet our brothers and sisters _comma_ nieces and nephews because everyone is on holiday :)
I still look at my kids baby photos
They used to be so sweet and innocent. Now they are literally home wreckers lo
I do say and its true
Came home tonight and there was an owl in my house.. My cat had dragged an owl through the dog door_comma_ but didn't kill it. Safe to say I almost ruined my pants_comma_ if you know what I mean.
No way! I called my brother at 12AM and he helped me capture it with a garbage bag and a fishing net so that we could release it back outside. That thing was scary_comma_ and it wasn't even that big! They're so spooky and stoic-looking...
I cannot wait for this weekend.  I am going to the lake for a 3 day weekend.
I have a jet ski.  It is a blast to ride on the lake with it.  
I am so happy with my life right now!
I recently had a child and my marriage is thriving!
I had to dog-watch my neighbors dogs this weekend. It was really easy_comma_ and I stayed at her house during the day since she was out of town_comma_ and it was peaceful and let me get work done. When she came back_comma_ she gave me $100! I would have done it for free. She's too nice.
Haven't done anything with it yet. College semester starts_comma_ so I'll probably use it to buy one of my textbooks. And yeah_comma_ she totally didn't have to do that... I feel kind of bad_comma_ especially because of how easy it was to do.
I am really not liking Mondays.
I was fired from my job. Who does that on a Monday?
I'm so not prepared for this presentation at work tomorrow
Thank you. I do too but I'm so worried about messing up.
Our home was broken into recently.
We weren't_comma_ thank goodness! I would have been scarred for life.
I was scared over the storm last night. I do not like bad weather
Its the worst
I'm happy to hear that he found a great band.
bluegrass
He loves it!
it made me mad to see someone put a dent in my door
nah_comma_ a clean escape
I ordered a 6 piece chicken nugget from McDonald's today and got 7 nuggets!
Definitely! I was stoked! Totally made my day!
I yelled at my toddler earlier because he wasn't listening but I think I went a little overboard with it.
It can be but I wish I handled it differently.
I'm excited for Red Dead Redemption 2 to come out!
Yes_comma_ sadly I'm still an adult who still gets excited about video games.
My dog passed away a week ago. I live alone_comma_ and he was the only person that kept me company when I came home at night. Apartment feels so quiet and lifeless without him around.
Yeah. I miss the pitter-patter of his feet_comma_ his bark_comma_ and having him with me when I fall asleep. He was older_comma_ so at least I got to experience him for a large part of my life. And he went peacefully_comma_ too. I have no idea how long it will take for me to move on.
I hope she got over it. Or I hope she found another pet that provided her the same joy. It's just a reminder that life and time are always marching forward and there's nothing you can do.
i thought i was going to be attacked by a huge dog running at me in the dark!
EXACTLY!he just wanted to play. but i had never met him befeore to know that
I woke up feeling down today. 
Memories of things not yet healed. Some days the past you are trying to get over and heal from just hits you in moments of weakness
For sure! It really does a lot to your spirit and even changes you..No fun
I won the opportunity to go up in a hot air balloon. Wonder who I should take with me.
Nope. Living the single life. Might take family or a friend.
So my kid loves to play with stupid model cars and stupid tiny legos. Well he didn't clean them up and this morning I rolled out of bed tired and walked to the kitchen and stepped on a stupid lego!
Yes!!! I probably yelled every cuss word ever invented. I think I even teared up for a minute!
I'm a bit upset today that the man who has lived here for a couple years has this house falling down around him and isn't fixing anything. 
He knows how to fix things and has such talents but doesn't use them here. It made me feel angry. He's not coming back until he starts helping

I hate those mornings..and sometimes at night when you're falling asleep. No good!

A lady friend came over and we had some fun...but she left me high and dry :( but I'm pretty optimistic.  She texts me every night asking what I'm doing

Someone I am kind of in a relationship with wants to come over this weekend and I am not sure about it.
It's too soon after so much trauma as happened and I don't want to deal with anymore upset.
That is very true. I am seeing how the rest of the week goes or I will simply not be here when they come to fix some stuff around the house.
I've been feeling isolated these days.  Still getting over a breakup and most of my friends are raging alcoholics.  But I look at how much money I'm saving by staying in and I feel a lot better!

I got lucky.
I was sad when I tripped in public. It was not a good look
It was badly

A partner kind of...They are away at therapy of sorts right now because even though I am committed..I won't be a punching bag. No one else has helped them in their life..being a stable and healthy home..so I have.
It's baby steps. I hope so..It will take more time to know! It's the beginning right now
My friend didn't like the price of wedding cakes_comma_ so she just made her own
Yea_comma_ really_comma_ She was getting quotes of $200+. We don't care about fancy cakes and just want her to be happy.
My almost 16 year old daughter wants to get her ear cartilage pierced.
I'm not so sure_comma_ it has to be done at a tattoo shop and we didn't have such a great experience when she was little and had her ears pierced.  I'm thinking it's more of a "follow the crowd" kinda thing than her truly wanting it.
My friend went against his parents wishes and didnt have a big 10k wedding.
They were upset_comma_ but he stuck to his decision.
I love being able to collect toys for kids who might not get them on Christmas.
On my own_comma_ I find it's easier to be in control.
It's the least I can do when I've been blessed when it comes to money.
My son wiped himself for the first time today!
He is 4.  He seemed a bit young but my wife said give it a go and he did it.
I've been with my wife for 30 years. I don't know how I got so lucky.

I knew my dad would help me with my test. He was good with math
He was a good dad
My friend passed away in a car accident in the 5th grade. I keep a photo of him around ever since.

Yeah he's a catch. 
Yes_comma_ but hopefully he will be gone soon. He is retiring. 
My neighbor_comma_ who I've lived near for eight years_comma_ just got a brand new boat. We're alright friends_comma_ and we get along well_comma_ and I don't usually have any negative feelings towards him. But I can't help but feeling like he's better than me after he's gotten a boat.

Ha_comma_ definitely not! He must have been a professional athlete or something like that.
i loved takin care of my sisters dog last week
a brindle boxer
Going to the store today was a bit hard. 
Not too bad! I do not like big stores or being around people sometimes but you still have to run errands. I just swallow the panic on those days as best as I can.
Try the big A store online as it is cheaper then walmart a lot. Do you know you can get pickup also at walmart for free? Helps if you don't want to shop there. I feel you on that- I don't like big stores especially!
Girlfriend found a lump in her throat. She has no idea what it could be. Has a doctor's appointment tomorrow. Not sure how forward I am looking to finding out the results_comma_ but I guess it's better than leaving it up to my imagination
She's had other health issues in the past_comma_ so maybe they're related. Either way_comma_ she's a worrier_comma_ so now she's non-stop pacing and looking stuff up online. It's all I can do to help her even get a few hours of sleep.
I feel guilty for smoking in the house today when it was raining outside.
It's a horrible addiction that I always keep putting off correcting.  I plan to make an effort to quit tomorrow.
I had to leave my dog at the vet overnight_comma_ so they can run some tests. She hasn't been eating much lately_comma_ and she's just been really lackadaisical and lazy. I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight_comma_ knowing she's there in a weird environment_comma_ all alone
She's almost 10_comma_ yeah. I know sometimes you just have to let go. But she was fine a few days ago! I'm still holding on to the idea that it's nothing. We'll see!
I still have the food processor my mom gave me_comma_ when i went away for college.
Yea. it's still kicking 40 years later.
I was not sure I wanted to start my new job. I was nervous
It was okay eventually
I'm jealous of people who own those new Tesla's. They are slick!
I need to start working on improving my career to afford one of those bad boys.
My family cosigned my mortgage loan_comma_ because my credit wasn't good enough
Thanks for understanding.Yes_comma_ I luckily have a great family.
I was mad when a check bounced my friend gave me. I knew he was shady
I learned a lesson for sure
I can't believe my neighbors_comma_  They are so rude.  I hope they move soon
They always play music so loud and today they parked on my grass.  I want to complain but i don't want to start a fight
I finally got around to making mug cake
It was delicious. I haven't had  cake that didn't come out of a plastic bag in over a year.
I don't get why people feel the need to be Facebook trolls and leave nasty comments?
You really think so?

The food was done on time this week!
Food is the gateway to life.
I dropped off my car at the mechanic and he said it would cost $300.  I picked it up today and the bill was $3000 and he never asked if I wanted to go that high.
I wish you had a car too.  Are you going to get one soon?
I've got lasagna in the oven. I hope it turns our well!
Thanks. I can smell it now.
I was envious when a coworker got a promotion over me. I really wanted it
I hope so
I lost my grandmother's wedding ring.
I have no clue where it is.  I am so hurt about it.
Lightning storms always remind me of you.
We had a night that was unforgetable.
I was sad when my brother canceled on me. He was busy
Its not a good thing
I do agree
Every time I make jello_comma_ I think of the jello shots me and my roomie used to make on weekends.
Some jello shots? I've got no one to enjoy them with anymore.
it was impressive to see my friend get a job so quickly last week
yea espeially when 20 people are going for the same position
I'm really worried I screwed up at work and said something I shouldn't have. Now I can't stop thinking about it

no he is still missing
I saw a possum and snake duke it out at our camping trip.
No one. We got a park ranger to scare the snake away.
I made kimchi and it turned out pretty bad.
It's fermented napa cabbage_comma_ a Korean dish.
once i left the window open cleaning my birds cage_comma_ and she flew away!
Never again did I see her.  I eventually let the emotion go.
This may sound narcissistic and just plain weird...but I'm actually envious of myself 3 years ago_comma_ that guy was shredded with an 8-pack and making $2000 a week. I hate his guts lol
Yup don't we all...but I was living at my parents' then and now I'm on my own_comma_ fully self-employed. So I guess I'm officially an adult
I knew i would win the lottory.
I know i will win all of them.
I keep all of my stuffed animals.
They mean the world to me
I was happy to relax this weekend. I felt content
Its a good life
I was nervous driving home. It was raining hard

I could not wait till my brother got home last night. We were going out to eat
We ate at a nice place
I saw a guy put chocolate syrup on a hot dog.
It was really gross!
Last time I ordered pizza from my local pizza shop for delivery_comma_ they forgot my sauces!! So I called and complained and was ensured that it would not happen again. So this time I put in the order and called to MAKE SURE my sauces came. They should be here any minute now.
Right! It totally ruins the whole meal without them!
I was happy when my mom baked me a cake last week. It was a nice gesture
It was a good cake too
I've been working really hard this entire week. I'm ready for the weekend. I'm going on a camping trip!
Yes_comma_ I have! I've planned several trips like this. 
It's just me. I like the solitude. 
Entered my dog into obedience training_comma_ and he graduated at the top of his class! I think they give all dogs that kind of distinction to make the owners feel better.. but I'm happy we're through it and that he's much better behaved
Thanks! Never done obedience training before. Only had one dog before this_comma_ though. Since this is the first dog I've truly had on my own_comma_ I kinda wanted to make sure they were raised right_comma_ even though the money was hard to spend.
I ripped my pants at work.
I bent over and then they ripped in half.
My dog found a cat in our backyard and has been nursing it.
haha I thought so_comma_ too. Guess my dog is a sweetheart.
I'm looking forward to my big break.  Don't know when it is but I know it'll be in this life because I've been at ground zero and am willing to go through more hell just to reach the decadent_comma_ prestigious pinnacle of material success in this lifetime and nothing can stop me
Thanks for you support.

I did after an hour
I have an interview tomorrow morning. I think I will definitely get a job offer because of my qualifications.
Thank you. I've been hoping to work in this field for a long time.
I was angry when my ac broke today. It was not good timing

i saw a kid crying by himself in the store today
he had walked away from them went to the candy section
I was envious of my neighbor. He built a new deck
I am thinking about it
I really care for my mother
Yeah she took care of all 3 of us kids by herself.  We've all grown up now and live alone.  She's done well for herself
She is.  Her birthday is tomorrow and I'm taking her out to dinner!
Left my book bag outside overnight. I live in the south where there's lots of palmetto bugs (cockroaches). Went and got it this morning... it was filled with the things!
Yeah. I just pretty much opened it_comma_ flipped out_comma_ closed it_comma_ then went and got a can of RAID that kills them_comma_ and opened it again and went to town! It was like I was possessed and raining bullets on them.
A bit unexpected but nice: my utility bills were much lower than expected this month.
Yeah I agree. You never know what it will be each month. I expected it to be higher this month due to the increase in A/C and fan usage_comma_ but actually wasn't bad. 
I just got married and I feel like life is perfect.
Not for me my friend.  I love it!
I ate an entire pizza
Not good at all_comma_ I wish i had not.
i was scared walkin home yesterday

We had no idea_comma_ but my best friend just told us he was gay last week. 
Yes for sure. He said he was afraid to tell anyone all these years. 
My friend just bought a BMW.
I know_comma_ I am so envious of him.
I really care about my community and it's growth.
Yeah_comma_ and most of my community does too_comma_ that's why it attracts good folks.
i had a huge test today_comma_but i was ready!
grades will be posted tonight but i feel very good about it
I'm pretty irritated.  My flight has been delayed 7 hours!
Due to weather.  Boy did I pick the wrong day to travel.
I'm curious to see which out of these 2 girls I'm texting I'll end up dating first...one 18 and one 24 both super smart and attractive
Thanks I was planning on that lol...I'm saying I wonder who'll bite first
I never drink milk anymore because it made me sick once.
It may have been_comma_ but I still avoid the milk.
My brother was supposed to help me with my chores. He didn't.
I can't do that. He always asking for help but when I need him_comma_ he is never there for me.
I ate my sisters food!
She has not found out yet!
I was ready for my drivers test!
I tried so hard but in the end I failed.
I was scared this morning. I woke up with a swollen eye
No_comma_ I am not sure what it was
No one even cares about me.
I do_comma_ and that makes all the difference.
It makes me remember the old days when I see happy days on tv
I do not believe that
i was mad when i saw a huge dent in my door
no idea... 
I was at my friends part last weekend_comma_ and someone threw up in the hot tub!
Yeah... the worst part was trying to clean up all the pieces. 
Was feeling lazy today_comma_ and for the most part I had decided I wasn't going to go running_comma_ that since i had done it yesterday_comma_ I could skip today. Managed to change my mind and exercised anyway. I feel good that I kept up my routine.
Yeah_comma_ once I fall out of my routine_comma_ it's so easy to just keep staying out of it. So I guess whatever I can do_comma_ even if it's not as good as the day before_comma_ to just stay in the routine and to stay at it_comma_ helps.
There is a storm approaching my house.
It's big but I am ready for it though.
i had to send my food back at the restaurant today.
my chicken was very undercooked.still pink in the middle.
Football practice has started for my middle-school aged son_comma_ and he's playing a few different positions. He's doing well in all of them_comma_ and he has a genuine interest and desire to get better_comma_ too. I'm glad I raised someone who could care about something deeply
I never played them. Never had the interest or athletic spirit. But I got him into them so he'd have some discipline and structure. 
Its amazing how a picture can bring back so many memories and take you back to a moment in time
I was cleaning out an old drawer and found some pictures from my graduation and of me and an ex.  Took me back to the old days. wow
I'm eagerly waiting on a bigger self-employed paycheck by the end of this month.  Whoopeee
Lil bit of voiceover/musician freelancing.  Upped the price from $5 to $20 a gig whle maintaining the same amount of repeat customers.
I won the golden ticket!
A trip to the factory of course!
i trusted my fried with my dog and i shouldnt have
thats a smart choice
I misunderstood what someone said to me at work today. I thought they said something offensive_comma_ and I reacted immediately. It turns out they said a different word. I felt mortified and kept apologizing profusely
It was sort of resolved. Everyone still feels a little awkward. Hopefully it will get to that point where it becomes an inside joke and we can all laugh about it.
My girlfriend dumped me today.
You're right_comma_ but I am so sad right now.
i was very happy buying my first new car today
a 2018 subaru WRX
i was scared walking home the other day
night time in a dark wooded area
I hate when people talk to me!
I do not mind you_comma_ but they always approach me!
My brother just told me his wife is pregnant. I could not be happier for him.
No_comma_ it is my brothers baby.
One day_comma_ I was to tired to mow the lawn.
No_comma_ my brother had to do it another even though we usually do it together.
Once I couldn't resist that glass of whiskey_comma_ even though I promised my wife I wouldn't.
Yes_comma_ she smelled it on my breath when I cam home_comma_ We have since talked it out.
Last weekend_comma_ I went to the swimming pool. I was getting out of the swimming pool when my swim short teared from behind. I felt so bad.
Everyone was looking at me. I went quickly to my towel to cover myself. It was a bad experience.
I was in awe when my dad won his award
Best toes in the USA.
I had an argument last week with my wife. She told me that she want to divorce and that I am not the father of our son. I felt destroyed.
No_comma_ I felt the house. I don't want to see her anymore. We are getting divorce.
I'm not alcoholic but I feel like I can vibe better with a chick if I've been drinking.  Because I tend to say stuff I normally wouldn't which makes for better conversation
I'm curious. Are you a guy or a gal
We took my neice and nephew to the lake this weekend!
A couple of them did!  The older people went fishing!
Yeah!  I caught a very large catfish!  The kids loved it!
Today was a beautiful day and I spent it reading in my hammock
Yeah_comma_ It felt so refreshing. I needed a day off from work_comma_ and it was just perfect.
My daughter's chihuahua mix was diagnosed with an auto-immune disease when she was just a puppy.
Yea_comma_ it was hard to deal with_comma_ but she had a really good life.  She passed away at age 6 this past February though.
I have to bake 10 cakes by tomorrow.
Yes_comma_ I am ready to do it.
Lifes good right now got a good paying job _comma_ all bills getting payed_comma_ not late on anything plus money on the side to go out _comma_ i am just overall happy in life right now
I am sure you will do well eventually _comma_ just keep setting goals an surpassing them _comma_ once u pass your goals _comma_ create new goals and keep winning in life !!!
My brother got hit with a DUI the other night. His wife said that was the last straw_comma_ as she was tired of his drinking. She kicked him out and now he's living with me. I feel so terrible for everyone involved_comma_ especially because they have two kids
Yeah_comma_ and you can never turn your back on family_comma_ even if they completely complicate your life.. It's a no-win situation. The kids probably prefer to stay in the original situation_comma_ even though it's not healthy and safe_comma_ because they just don't understand.. just a big head ache. I'll do what I can_comma_ but who knows how much that will be.
I hear you. You got a good attitude. I wish for the best for you. Thanks!
i was crushed when i didnt win the lottery

Yes I was livid! I was only 10 minutes late. They offered me the next flight_comma_ which is not until tomorrow afternoon. I get a hotel and free meals.
The love of my life left me for a better man.
I feel like sometimes i can be overbearing with my love and it backfires on its intended purpose 
I'm happy that I have more self-respect than most of my friends who desperately seek approval from women....I focus on my money scheme and end up getting more dates than they do it's hilarious
More like women like me because I have ambition.  Plus I go to the gym 6 times a week drive my own fully paid car have no baby daddy bills and live life on my own terms completely self employed.  In a nutshell
I am baffled on how are of control Trump is right now.

My husband is coming home from work soon.
Yes! I am so happy to see him!
So I moved to a new town recently_comma_ but I don't know anyone here to hang out with yet.
That's a good idea_comma_ even though I'm not much on sports. Just a kind of bummer not knowing anyone yet.
I was parking my car today and someone just cut in from of me a took my place. How rude can you get?
Well no_comma_ I didn't want to be too confrontational. But I even indicated I was taking the spot. It's so crazy.
You know how FB will show you memories from years ago? 
Nah_comma_ it depends on how you use it..I use it to help pets and buy local items..also to keep in touch with people who live far away.  It's showed me a few that made me think of my pets who have passed and how much I miss times with them.
i was impressed when i saw lebron had gone to the lakers
yes it is
I got a check in the mail today!

I passed gas in the middle of church.
I ate too many beans. I am so ashamed of myself!
My basement got very damaged last year during a storm_comma_ so this year I decided to buy a bunch of supplies.

I feel positive sometimes today even though not in the best mood.

Another year_comma_ Another disappointed me_comma_ no father no nothing.
My dad is never coming home.

Nope. I always thought there were monsters under the bed.
Without my coach_comma_ I would be nothing.
no a sports coach hahaha
My friend returned my shoes today. I was so thankful.
He was indeed. I shouldn't have gotten so hammered last night and lost them.
A skunk was in my yard the other night...At first I was scared and froze
Oh..I think they are wonderful! I LOVE wildlife..I just didn't want to get sprayed or my dog..Or for the skunk to get hurt by my dog! He was SO cute! Everything was fine- Dog came back in quick and the skunk waddled away- I think I surprised him! He was probably eating the bird seed :)
Never..lol. That type of person should be put in jail. Skunks are wonderful. So freaking cute- Just can't get too close.
all is right in my wold when i eat my favorite meal
a nice juicy cheese burger with mushrooms
The pizza I ordered was going to come in 30 minutes.
Yes_comma_ but It felt like hours!
It sounded like a big bomb went off the other night by my house.
Honestly you can't tell if it's gunshots here_comma_ fireworks (even though illegal most of the year here) or a firebomb. Police won't come..So unless I have cameras up...You don't know...or your window gets shot..
i loved taking care of my sisters bearded dragon
yea they are a nice pet to have
spoons
I walked in the house and my wife was cheating on her diet with cake in her hand
Jenny craig! she was doing so good.
My friend returned my wallet yesterday. I was so relieved!
I left it on the top of my car! I am so careless sometimes.
I start classes next week at a new school.
No_comma_ I am not nervous at all. I know it will go great.
I had to eat dinner by myself again.
I hate being by myself.
I took out the garbage yesterday and the bag burst on me.
I freaked out and left it in my driveway! Never been so disgusted in my life!
I just finished booking a vacation for the fall.  I am pretty happy with how it is turning out
I am not reading a book_comma_ I was booking a vacation.
"I could be sleeping tonight but got back up because I have dogs barking on both sides of my house_comma_ so loud that not even a fan drowns them out
I looked into it and yes_comma_ there is a noise ordinance.  My neighbors don't seem to care about it unfortunately.  I will have to speak to them again.  I know...they are neglected.
 woke up a lot last night and felt like I didn't sleep at all. So I was not in the best mood all day and everything was getting on my nerves
I am! But I normally sleep pretty good. I am so exhausted by bed time- I woke up a bunch last night to go to the bathroom? So annoying.
I need them_comma_ thank you!
Sometimes I wish my mother loved me more_comma_  I feel like my brother got it all.
I think they put all of their effort toward him.
my little sister got a job and is still in highs school i know this was  a common thing for anyone back in the days _comma_ but in todays world a lot o people are lazy and in titled i felt happy for her
im doing great _comma_ im just really happy for her 
I am one of two candidates for a job opening_comma_ and I think I got it!
Thanks! I did really well on my interviews so I feel like I have it in the bag
i went into that interviewing knowing the answer to every question they threw at me!
yea it worked out great!
My roommate went shopping by taking my car. He did not even bother to ask me or let me know. I was very furious
No_comma_ this is the first time happening. I can't grasp how he dared to act in this way
School starts tomorrow for my oldest. I really hope he does well and enjoys it and that he doesn't get scared or miss me too bad or misbehave.
I remember thinking how bad I had it because I had to go to school every day. Now I wish that was the worst thing I had going on! Lol.
i got upset when i saw my brother riding a brand new BMW
yea.. its nice to have no kids and no other bills :) .. course im jealous
I hoped today that I would get a charge reversed from a company that charged me early for a free trial
Thankfully after some pushing and pulling_comma_ they refunded me! They didn't want to at first though_comma_ arg!
OH! I have never heard of that. I plan on getting a bum card from now on though with just a few bucks on it_comma_ because I don't like companies having my info especially if they are refusing a refund!
it sucked seeing my brother go to disneyworld for two weeks while im stuck at home working
yea we are planning a trip now!
Today! I am super angry at a company for not wanting to refund me after they charged me for a month_comma_ early!
They are in the UK and had good reviews but NO phone number! Only email. I didn't like their software and the rep was SO RUDE and acted like they were doing me a favor in refunding me for something that just started today and I wouldn't be using for a month_comma_ so why should I be paying for it?
I didn't use it at all_comma_ they charged me early. Not sure why I need to pay for it then??
I thought a free trial date was Aug 10th_comma_ not the 8th so I was charged last night!
It was the first day at MIDNIGHT for a month of software though and I hadn't even touched it most of the free trial and I deleted my acct so I can't use it anyway. They don't have a PHONE number and the CS rep was SO nasty and said I couldn't be refunded on a software I am not even USING and I was JUSt charged! I couldn't believe how nasty the rep was! I wanted to smack her!
I was refunded! A dispute would cost them more_comma_ so she was super snotty and refunded it!
I feel bad I don't always get to go through bad things and full get healed. 
Well I hate going through anything bad..but I never get to go through the process of it and get healed because I have someone who was around me during the worst times of my life who took that away from me and made the focus be on them..which disrupted my process of grief and healing
I've been dieting and exercising_comma_ and I'm starting to see the results. It's been a while since I've had this much confidence in how I look. I can't until everyone back home sees me!
I'm on the paleo diet that everyone talks about! With eating only a little bit of carbs_comma_ and mostly meat. It's kind of interesting_comma_ if you read about it. And for some reason_comma_ I don't feel that restricted.
You know_comma_ I'm actually not sure! I've never compared the two. Maybe they're pretty similar. I don't think it matters much_comma_ as long as you just stay within limits and count calories. Good luck!
I had to deal with some truly terrible customer service reps today. They MIGHT own the company but be disguised as support
This was email support and no one I could "report" the support too? Especially if they own the company :/ they were SO snotty and rude..I don't understand how anyone ever uses their software!
They are the company. They only have a support button.
Super upset with a company I thought was trustworthy.
Well I looked up reviews..I didn't see anything bad in my FB groups about them either..and they decided to charge me early and didn't want to refund me!
They had NO number_comma_ support was super rude but finally refunded me..not without a lot of threats though :/
I threatened that_comma_ so they refunded. I am still going to blast them on social media though and tell everyone NOT to use them after how rude they are and expecting me to be charged for a whole month of something I haven't/won't use
One time I was giving a presentation and something really embarrassing happened.
I started up the presentation and I accidentally copied an inappropriate image into one of the slides..
I quickly scrambled to turn off the presentation but the damage was done. Everyone had seen it
My son was diagnosed with epilepsy recently and he had to have an MRI done.
Yes! The MRI was clean. It's probably genetic and he will likely outgrow it.
Yes_comma_ thankfully too the medication has prevented him from having any episodes.
I went to the movies last night
It was one of the Star Wars movies!
It was very good. And made me feel big time.
I hate causing a scene and being the center of atention.  its the worst
The other night my wife and I were out at dinner and I spilled my whole glass of water all over the table and myself.  Everyone looked over at us_comma_ i was blushing so hard.
I went shopping today and when I came out to my car I was furious.
I came out and someone had hit the bumper of my car and just took off without saying anything
Its crazy how sometimes something or someone you havent thought about in a long time can impact you out of no where
Someone that I went to high school with is really sick and it sounds like they might die soon.  Its upsetting to hear news like that.  It makes you think about things.
Some jerk ran into my car because he crossed a red light
I'm fine...just a little bruising is all thankfully. But_comma_ I am absolutely buying a dash cam now so I don't have to listen to the other driver claim it was my fault for them passing a red light
I was watching the news and they said we are supposed to get a big storm this weekend
I was worried that we might lose power for a few days_comma_ so i went to the store and stocked up on food_comma_ just in case.  That way ill be ready if it is bad
my story got nominated in an award.. i am so excited
no.. it is an online venture.. i may or may not win.. but nominatiin itself is an honour for me..

Its crazy to get news that can make you happy and scared at the same time!
My wife and I just found out that we are expecting our first child.  Its pretty exciting.  I gotta start saving up money now though.
A co-worker bought breakfast for our department.
It was unexpected. I thanked them
Ineed_comma_ I hope they do it again.
I am going to a concert really soon and I am very excited.
My favorite band_comma_ Green Day. It should be a lot of fun. Are you doing anything exciting soon?
I struggled to use public transport to commute to office.
While commuting in public transport I was unable to keep punctuality. But now I'm on time to office since my husband gifted me a motor bike. 
One of our friends just got a call that her child was not at school.
We don't know yet_comma_ she's gone to the school and will let us know. We're hoping it's a mistake. She's 11 years old.
I went to a big party this weekend
Yes and all the people were very nice!
My dad was in the hospital recently. He was in very bad condition and didn't look like he was gonna pull through. Thankfully he did.
Yeah_comma_ I can't imagine life without my dad. It'll happen someday_comma_ I just would prefer it to happen once he's lived a full life.
One of our friends got a call from the school that her 11 year old wasn't at school_comma_ and it turned out to be a mistake. Glad_comma_ but upset at the false alarm.
Yeah_comma_ it really scared us for a little bit.
Gave my friend a spare key to my house just in case I get locked out or need them to go in for an emergency.
Yea it is_comma_ they actually give me theirs first and I figured I'd do the same.
I couldn't believe the slowpoke I got stuck behind in traffic this morning!
It was so aggravating! It made me late to work.
I'm so upset and embarrassed that I failed my LSATs and now I can't get into law school. 
I can but it's only given a few times a year and the next one isn't for another 4 months. 
I'm going on a guided fishing trip in september.
Hopefully not it should be fine here.
I'll try :)
I took the family to our county fair a couple of days ago.
We had a really nice time_comma_ rode some rides_comma_ listened to some music.
I took care of my brother this weekend. He was a little sick
A little bit I guess
I bumped into some of my old high school friends randomly the other night.  We spent a lot of time talking and catching up
yea it was great! but ever since then ive just been thinking about the old times and some people from my past and wondering what they are up to
I miss my dad. This was his favorite time of the year
Yeah_comma_ it really does
I once skipped out on thanksgiving with my family to go on a road trip with a girl. I didn't answer their phone calls. It was fun_comma_ but I didn't like disappointing my family.
It was fun_comma_ which is what makes me so conflicted about it. What wasn't fun was seeing my family's faces when I got back.
I knew I do well on my work project. I prepared hard
It was for a marketing campaign_comma_ thank you
I had an embarasing moment recently
I done walked on one of them slippy spots on the side walk there. It had ice on it and so I slipped and fell right down.
It makes me happy when you find good people in the world
At work the other night_comma_ a customer left me a really big tip and now im going to be able to pay some bills that I didn’t think I was going to be able to.
I've been trying to recover from a financial setback for the past few months.
It's very slow and very stressful. I'm making some progress_comma_ and struggling to hang on in the meantime.
I  my ex and I are done for good
8 years. That a long time_comma_ but we just weren't getting along. I miss hime now
I am having a hard time but I am trying
Ive been doing really well at work lately. I am due for my yearly evaluation and I think I will get that promotion I wanted.
I hope so. My managers feedback over the last few months has been great. I dont see why I wouldnt get it.
I saw a rat running down the power line behind my house.
Tell me about it.  I don't think i've ever seen that before.
I did look around toe house to make sure there aren't any mouse holes
Last week_comma_ i went to native. I visited my place after years
yes indeed_comma_ i got emotional after seeing the places_comma_ it brought back childhood memoeries
I did set a goal of saving a specified amount. I reached it within 3 month after cutting on many leisure related activities. I am proud of myself
You definitely should. Saving should be a very important habit for every individual. You never know what could happen in life
I saw a dog that got hit by a car.
When I was looking at the scene he was still alive. I don't know what happen later on.
Since i met my friend over a decade ago while working at mcdonalds _comma_ he was always been there for him _comma_ so i will always be there for him
i plan to move to a new state very soon_comma_ i havent told him yet _comma_ but ill make sure to hang out with him one last time
I am so mad right now that I am actually shaking
My bank locked me out of my account_comma_ so I have no way to get access to my money and I am going on vacation on Friday.
Im leaving for vacation this weekend. It has been a long time since I have had time off. I can not wait to go.
Im going to Austin Texas. We are going on the lake and ride around in the boat. Its going to be so nice.
I live in Florida and was quite scared when the hurricane came over us! I really didn't know what would happen.
Yes_comma_ but luckily not nearly as much as some of my neighbors.  It was a nail biting night for sure though! 
My finances will be getting better in the next year.
I get a raise that kicks in in February.
Its me and my fiances anniversary next month and keeps dropping hints about what hes getting me_comma_ and I have no idea what it is because I have not told him I wanted anything. Its puzzling but makes me eager to see.
No_comma_ they're more like_comma_ "I know what I'm getting you" and then when went over bills he was like Im going use money for your gift_comma_ non specific type of hints Lol
I once went to relieve myself in the bathroom of a bar and saw vomit all over almost every surface. If I hadnt immediately run out of there I would have definitely ended up contributing to the mess.
They do. I just feel sorry for the poor guy who had to clean it!
I was pleased with my youngest daughters progress in learning the piano last night as she played for us.
She has_comma_ and her sister is a violinist too.
I got home from yesterday and my girlfriend got me concert tickets for this weekend. I thought it was sold out. I couldnt believe she did that.
The band Phoenix. She really caught me off guard with this. Apparently she bought them a while back but waited until now to tell me. 
I found an old childhood shirt of mine in storage the other day. It was white and red with mickey mouse on it. I remember riding my bikes through the neighborhood with my friends with that shirt on.
I must have been around 8 or 9 when that shirt still fit. I lived right by a mangrove forest. Me and my friends would roam through it and make up stories of things that had happened there.
I went through that too. I'm sort of going through that now. It was much easier for me to make close friends when I was young than it is now.
Yesterday I was so content. i sat outside and watched my kids play on their waterslide.
Yes I love watching them play and enjoy themselves.
Yes I get to sit under the tree too and get some shade.
My daughter graduated over the summer_comma_ and I felt a sense of accomplishment for her.

Do you ever just feel trapped.  Its so aggravating
They are repaving my street and I cant leave the house becasue we arent allowed to drive on it.  I need to go to work later so they better let me drive on it eventually!
Hello_comma_ I have not seen you for a long time
Hahaha how are you?
Well_comma_ well_comma_ do you play LoL?
I happened to walk up on a snake in my backyard a few days ago.
I killed it_comma_ and burned it.
A coworker just knocked all the documents on my desk to the floor. It was an accident but they didnt even bother to help pick them up. Very rude I thought.
He didnt even apologize. Just shrugged his shoulders and kept going. Unreal_comma_ some people.
I quit my job due to the employer always lying to me_comma_ and they didnt even seem to care. 
I know it was too bad tho I had expectations of them but obviously they are fake! 
I recently got serious about working out again and I was so nervous and apprehensive my first day in the gym.
It was sort of. But it ended up not being too bad.
Just come up with something you enjoy and you'll love to go. My  motivation is the 2 free hours of childcare!
Oh yes. At least school is starting soon.
When I went to college I tried to make things work with my high school sweetheart. A few months in I found out she cheated on me and my stomach sank. I never talked to her again after that.
about four years ago. I'll never forget the feeling. It was like getting hit by a truck.
It's about to rain here. I hope the power doesn't go out.
about 20% of the time we get a storm.
I consider myself an animal activist now. I recently went to a protest
Someone hurt my neighbors dog at a boarding house and it really bothered me
I had never been to a protest but it was really empowering. My neighbors dog wasnt the only one
I cant believe that I won $100 on a scratch off ticket. I think I am going to buy a new pair of shoes with it. I cant wait to go cash it in.
I was super pumped up. I cant wait to go get those shoes after work today.
My friend asked me to borrow some money and I let him. 
IDK yet still waiting to see if he actually pays me back. I didnt want to really do it but I did. 
MY best friend and I have worked together for ten years.
We did. Now she is leaving and moving away
That is going to be a big change. I want to quit and move too lol
I never seem to get lucky in love :(
Theres this girl at work that I like_comma_ and I just saw her eating lunch with another guy and now im kind of sad
Ihave ebery thing my kids have ever made me.
IT is_comma_ but there is so much I don't know what to do any more
I was thinking that but then I couldnt look when I wanted 
I remember graduating high school. It felt like I had my whole future in front of me_comma_ so many possibilities to choose from. I sometimes wonder if I made the right decisions.
Exactly. I turned out okay_comma_ but I sometimes wonder if I would have been happier had chosen another college or a different job.
The first time I went to a haunted house I was so scared.
It was one of those where people jump out at you.
Yeah I literally had my head down the whole time while my dad guided me through.
I am staying positive that my blood results will come back okay.
My health in general. I havent had a check up in 10 years and have been feeling off. 
Another one of my neighbors got a new car.
Who cares? I want a new car too. I think I am the only one on my block without one now
I do too. I need a raise!
My kids are only 4 and 5 now but ther are so smart!
I am. I know they will all want to go to college. I hope Im not jinxing it lol
Cool!
I won a raffle for a hunting trip.
I don't know. I just got the call that I won.  I've got to set a date.
Maybe.  I'd have to pay for them_comma_ we'll see how much it is.
I am supposed to be moving in with my boyfriend next month.
It is_comma_ but I keep wondering if it's the right choice.
I'm glad it's raining here today.
We've been kinda dry lately.
I planned a trip with a friend not too long ago to see the solar eclipse. We were going to go on a road trip. The day before we were supposed to leave he told me she couldn't get off work_comma_ and I ended up bored at home.
I was! I had already bought solar eclipse glasses and everything. I ended up watching on the TV
last week_comma_ my pet dog died. His name is Jack.

I finally get to go school shopping today!
Thrift stores. That's wher you find the real bargains
ME tii!
I cant wait for my last paycheck to come in from my previous job. 
Yeah I did find a new job. :) 
The first time I asked a girl out_comma_ it was way back in middle school. My heart was beating out of my chest. She said no_comma_ but I learned that rejection isn't the end of the world.
Your emotions are so heightened at that age. It seemed like a big deal at the time_comma_ but it's funny to look back at it now.
One of my favorite movies of all tyme is pans labyrinth by guillermo del toro _comma_ but the ending is a bit depressing even for me
the little girl has a hard life_comma_ but in her head she is in a story _comma_ at the end she gets killed 
All of my friends abandoned me and I have no idea why.
Maybe but what's the point if they will abandon me too?
I've gotten a raise that'll start in February.
I just did_comma_ by telling you...lol. No_comma_ I'll be too broke till then.
My daughter was feeling a bit under the weather last night.
She's at school so she wasn't too bad_comma_ but I'll have to wait to find out this afternoon.
I woke up to a loud noise last night.
Someone was trying to break in. My heart was racing and I was panicking. 
My friend showed up at my new house in a completely different state! 
Not at all! 
I wish I had a bigger house_comma_ I see people with these nice houses and feel envious.'
We can hope!
I went to a football game the other day and had a blast!
I had some nachos! My favorite team ended up winning the game!
I have a great day and news to go along with that!
My sister done called me. She will pay me a surprise visit this week!

thank you _comma_ long story short the machine did not even work an found out it came from korea
My girlfriend's friend died in a car crash a few months ago. She took it really hard. It was terrible seeing her go through that. I stayed with her that whole week.
I've never lost anybody that close to me_comma_ I can't imagine. She still cries about it sometimes
I found out in the last year that both of my parents have dementia.
Yes_comma_ they've already gone pretty far. My dad thinks that I'm half my age. My mother only knows who I am about half the time.
My mother in law came to visit for the first time and fell so hard on ice. It was scary. 
Shes older so thats was it was so scary. She did end up injuring her hip. 
One day I will have everything I want out of life_comma_ that makes the hard times easier to live now.
If there isn't_comma_ what's the point of life?
A situation happened to me earlier this week where my faith was tested.
A woman approached me on the street and wanted to sleep with me_comma_ but I had to tell her I was married. I stayed true to my loving wife.
Not at all.
I just received a raise at my one year evaluation. It is so nice to know that they value their employees. It makes me want to continue to do well at work.
I can definitely see upward mobility. This raise makes me want to stick around and work to achieve a higher status. I really appreciate them.
I have to run an errand after work so i'll catch traffic and its going to take me an extra 30mins to get home.
Yeah its pretty awful. It basically doubles my time to get home.
I was listening to pandora and an old song came on that reminded me of my parents. 
Johnny B Good! A solid gold oldie! Brought back so many memories. 
hahah yessss! nailed it. 
I'm getting scared because both of my parents will not be with me too much longer. They've both got dementia.
About a year ago. They hardly know me anymore_comma_ and I'm an only child with no real connection to my extended family.
So I have been traveling around by myself.  It has been getting to me this week. I miss my friends.
I just got to Vietnam. There is no one in this hostel so I havent met anyone to hang out with. Maybe I should move to a different city.
No one will watch my Youtube videos and it's frustrating.
I have but no bites. I don't get why people won't give me a chance.
I just took my final exam at law school.
I am pretty sure that I did really well. I find out next week.
I won first place in a mountian bike race last weekend.
Thanks its the first time I've won one before.
It is thanks. I got a trophy and everything.
There would usually be four of us playing per round. The person who came in last had to take two shots. The person who finished third had to take one shot. The person who came in second had to take one shot. The person who won the round didn't have to take a shot. It was a fun game. 
"Super Shot Brothers" We would play using the Nintendo game "Super Smash Brothers"
Yeah_comma_ it was awesome. Definitely one of my more fond memories. 
My internet keeps going in and out and it is really bothering me! Why can't it just work like it is supposed to!
It is wireless.  I keep on having to unplug and then plug back in the router and modem!  Very frustrating!
Im starting my new job in 2 weeks and counting day every last second! 
I cant honestly I am so ready for it! 
So I got my final grade back. Even though I studied a lot I still failed. Now I have to take the class over the summer. Im so bummed.
It just ruins some summer plans I had. I was supposed to go on a trip but now I wont be able to make it.
I have big tests in three of my classes this week!
A little_comma_ but I'm not worried about it. I'll do fine.
I'm dreading the loss of my parents. they are 88 and 85 now and both with dementia.
They're kinda already gone. You can't talk to them_comma_ they don't remember more than 30 seconds at a time.
i stated running recently 2 miles a day_comma_ the other day i increased it to 3 miles and did not even break a swet i felt really good
im 31 and in a few months ill be 32
I hate flying. Something bad is going to happen_comma_ I feel it. I don't want to get on this flight.
Because_comma_ plane crashes are awful!
My exam results are up next week. Result is so important for me this time
No _comma_ I think it well. But however i have butterflies in my stomach already now
My neighbor is so loud at night. Everynight after 11pm shes out in the parking lot_comma_ in and out of her vehicle making noise. 
It is honestly especially when you have to work in the morning 
I had a very nice stranger do something for me today at the grocery store.
I was $4 short on my grocery bill and they stepped in and paid for it. I was very thankful!
I hurt my foot at work the other day. Kinda ruined my plans.
I tripped over something. It really sucks because I was planning on going to the park with my daughter.
People need to stop letting their dogs poop in my yard! They aren't even respectful enough to clean it up!
It's so gross! It can attract all sorts of bugs and rodents!
my neighbors had a party last night_comma_ so freaking annoying! I could barely sleep. I went to talk to them but they didn't care
I did call police later on. I didn't wanna do it but i had no choice
I ran into an old high school friend while at the store. It was a shock! 
Yup about 15 years! I also live in a totally different state than the school we went to! 
When I was at the store the other day_comma_ I slipped in front the cute girl that works the register. I feel like such an idiot.
I dont know if I can go back there again. I looked pretty stupid.
Both of my Daughters have performed well in school so far.
Yes_comma_ I think that they do. They don't usually dread school like a lot of kids do.
One day my son broke my facorite lamp
He did and thought I was going to hit him
First day of work at a new place
I knew they hired me for my skills and talent so I knew I would succeed 
My neighbor watched my kids at the last minute when I was in a bind_comma_ she's awesome.
I haven't yet but I think I'll treat her to a musical she wants to see that's coming to town.
On my 29th birthday my wife invited all my friends without me knowing
Yes I did_comma_ It was such a shocker!
The thing the bugs me the most at my job is really lazy workers _comma_ they only work when management is around and as soon as they leave back to being lazy
well i do care _comma_ and if i every become management again im firing everyone slowly
I was a bit nervous on my wedding day. 
Biggest thought in my mind was : Would my wife really only be with just me for the rest of my life?"
Last time I visited my parents I passed in front of my old highschool. It was cool to see the old football stadium still there.
I wont be back until Christmas. Maybe then Ill pass by my old friends house to see if it looks the same.
My wife has owned her own business for 3 years.
I am_comma_ I am really impressed with her
I fixed my AC all by myself. Pretty impressive if I do say so. 
For real! I was impressed by what you can find on the internet now a days. 
now that I am married I no longer feel I don't have a companion
Well_comma_ I don't feel lonely anymore because I just got married buddy
Thanks buddy
I experienced the grossest thing this weekend
I was at a theme park and someone got off a rollercoaster and they threw up right in front of me.  It was so gross_comma_ i thought I was going to be sick

 My wife has been so stressed out lately but I have been taking care of her. 
Everything_comma_ not able to find a job_comma_ we just moved_comma_ too much going on. ugh 
My son was accepted into college the other day!
He is going to be an engineer! Although I told him it is ok to change paths once in school and you get a feel for it
I felt like I was living in a real live sports movie over the weekend_comma_ it was pretty cool
My son had a soccer tournament and his team won.  The craziest part was that he scored the game winning goal.
Just the other day it was my sons first birthday!
I was so happy_comma_ it is crazy how quickly a year goes by
It was such a great day. He came so quickly! Ready to meet the family!
Two years ago when my son came. I still get nostalgic thinking about it.
Yes! Do you have children?
My uncle helped me out with $1_comma_000 when moving out of state recently.
Yeah_comma_ for sure. I'm not sure I could have really done it without some help.
It really is great to have family that cares. Things like this really make you remember it.
My daughter won an award at school. 1 out of 1000 kids could win and she won it for art! 
I am very proud of her and still cant believe that she won! So amazing. 
I studied for 1 whole year for the S.A.T.

My grandma becomes too old and depend on others for her needs.
My neighbor lets her cats use the bathroom outside in our yard_comma_ and of course I stepped in some.

I like to work on my old truck in my garage sometimes. Makes me nostalgic.

I usually just buy bottles of water_comma_ lol
My former roomate left her cat keychain here. We fought a lot_comma_ but I kinda miss her now.
Yea. She's going to grad school across the country now.
Something really great happened when I was eating with a friend earlier.
When we finished eating my friend gave me a gift as a token of our friendship. It was really sweet.
My brother promised not to tell my parents my secret_comma_ and of course he still did. 
No_comma_ and He really shouldnt have told. He promised me. 
I told my wife my deepest darkest secret. 
Ok good for you
 My grandma becomes too old and depend on others for her needs.
I'm taking care of her completely.

I spilled all my coffee on my shirt in front of the cute barista. I dont think I can return. What an idiot.
Oh man I dont know. I feel awkward. Maybe Ill go back next week and make a joke about it.
Im pretty nervous_comma_ and i need some positive thoughts sent my way.
Ive been talking to this girl that I like and I think I’m going to finally work up the courage to ask her out on a date.  I think that she will say yes!
I was feeling really courageous today and did something that I normally wouldn't do.
I went up to a girl I liked and asked her out. She said yes!
For some reason_comma_ when I turned ten I demanded a surprise birthday party from my parents. To trick me_comma_ they ended up planning the party for the day after my birthday. I was extremely disappointed on my birthday_comma_ but they sure got me the next day!
It sure upset me at the time_comma_ but I appreciate it all the more now!
 It was storming the other night and the power went out.  
It was out all night and it was super scary. I heard a noise from the kitchen.

My grandfather was diagnosed with cancer recently.
Yeah I have been visiting him every week and spending time with him
I'm pretty broke_comma_ I'm not in my home state anymore_comma_ I'm unemployed_comma_ and I don't feel as though I have a future ahead of me.
Yeah_comma_ I've considered it_comma_ it's just that I'm also recovering from some medical issues that got me here in the first place. Overall_comma_ 2018 has sucked.
I answered wrong for the easy question in quiz competition.
I lost the competition. I feel shame about it.
I was really looking forward to the birth of my daughter_comma_ but that feeling when I saw her for the first time.  Nothing like it at all.
I would think it wouldn't feel the same with my second daughter_comma_ but no_comma_ it felt the same way all over again.
I'm glad I left school.  I would've probably ended up taking a job I hated.
self-employed freelancer making $2000 a week

On my birthday my parents give me a decent sized check
It helps pay for bills and debt_comma_ I am so appreciative of it

Absolutely. She makes us very happy. Her name is Coconut
She's white! That's how she got the name
I am finally finished with my work project!
It's one of those that are for another business and about making money!
I'm the guy who gets mad at his friends for not living up to their full potential.
like they introduced me to this self-employe gig they only do part time...and now I pay rent and bills with it_comma_ plus save some extra....and they still want to do it part time and keep their dead-end jobs they complain about!
At the movies last week_comma_ the children would not stop talking.
No they were unsupervised_comma_ I was getting fed up
I have always been a fan of pets
I have a german shepard. I love taking him out for walks.

In high school it felt like everyone had their first kiss before me.
It took so long and I was getting envious of everyone else

Right now in my life_comma_ I seem to be confused as to what i'm doing and where I should be. I don't feel as though I have a stable base to start from.
Well_comma_ I'm not sure if I agree with that. I tend to think that each person is supposed to be on a specific path set before them.
I had an embarrassing moment last week when I went to work. 
I left home in my pajama pants and didn't realize till I got to work!
I remembered myself as a kid watching "Fivel Goes West" with my mom and dad when I heard the song "Somewhere Out There" on TV today.
Too bad.  It's a great movie
My cat just turned 23 last week and has been really sick.

I just finished a big project of mine and I am really happy with how it turned out!

me too! i'm pretty cheap :) i didn't expect that dress to be such a good quality
I turned 29 the other day_comma_ originally I was kinda feeling bummed out about being in the last year of my 20's.
I was feeling the same way but then I really looked back and reflected on my life and I'm actually pretty happy with where I am at today. I feel like I've accomplished my goals this far and that made me feel good.

A singing competition
I was watching a sporting event_comma_ X games actually. I saw a trick that really impressed me.
It's for extreme sports and that sort of stuff_comma_ like skateboarding.

My daughter slept in too late this morning.
No_comma_ but we had to rush more than normal.

Nice yeah I love how at the beginning there are foreshadowing images of Tyler flashing in and out of frame...pretty unique style of filming
i am visiting my old hometown on vacation!
San Diego_comma_ CA. I haven't been back here in 12 years. Being back here brings back sooooo many memories!

I am looking for a new vehicle.
I am trying to find something that is easy on the gas and affordable
I just got my vacation approved by work. I leave next week. Im getting real antsy though.
Im going to the beach. It is about 6 hours away. Its all I can think about. I hope I dont forget anything.
Hi_comma_ I had a great vacation but something went wrong
My pet dog done died.
My son just passed his fist level in swimming lessons. I feel good to be his dad right now.
Yes_comma_ we would practice every even in our pool when the weather is nice. 
I was fishing the other day in a boat when a large alligator swam right under my boat! I felt him bump into it too.
A little of both! I was just scared he'd tip the boat over! 
Thought I'd never squat 300lbs again after my surgery...but I shocked myself with my progress_comma_ and now I rep 315lbs ten times on the regular
Great good for you
My 15 year old cat passed away recently. It hurts really bad. I spent a large amount of my life around that cat.
She was a very friendly cat. I will miss her. Hopefully I feel better as time passes.
My pet budgie bird died this morning.
He was 10 years old_comma_ we spent so much time together. It's hard when you loose a pet.
My daughter recently got a spot in headstart for this year and I'm excited.

My daughter is 3 as well. Last year she was in Mother's Day out but it cost money and was only 2 days a week.

Not yet_comma_ but I can't wait to graduate and start working.
My friend learned how to fly a plane in his spare time!
Yup. He said he might move up to bigger craft but he's not sure yet. Regardless_comma_ I wish I had the nerves to do that
I seen this guy driving his motorcycle only on his back wheel today. It was crazy 
Oh no_comma_ yeah he seemed like he had it under control. It was pretty cool.
I'm going on a date tonight. I'm pretty nervous
Yeah probably. I'm sure I'll be fine.
I think I will.
My dad just gave me his carbon fiber road bike since he got a new one! I never expected he would give it to me because I know its worth a lot!
I know!  I love it!  I would never have been able to afford it on my own!  It wasn't even my birthday either!
Hey_comma_ how's it going? Isn't it tough meeting new people these days?
Same here. It also sucks when people let you down. I once let this guy crash on my couch because he had lost his apartment_comma_ and it didn't end up good at all.
Right? Like_comma_ I understand people who are just dirty or have little quirks_comma_ but this guy was actively stealing from me_comma_ and I was letting him live with me rent free. It's just frustrating.
I recently had a chance to buy an electric vehicle but ended up opting for one that was conventional. I feel a little bad about the decision.
Well_comma_ I really do care about the environment and feel like a hypocrit. I usually preach to others about pollution and what not_comma_ and here I am not making a decision consistent with my values.
I feel that for every loss in my life I gain tenfold more blessings.  My life's pretty great these days not gonna lie
Agreed.  When my ex left me I was heartbroken. But now I'm fully self-employed_comma_ chasing my dreams_comma_ and meeting way more attractive girls 
The other day_comma_ my daughter decided we needed to take a homeless man a sandwich. I'm so grateful for her kind spirit.
I am sure she will. Have you experienced a situation like that before?
Great act of kindness don't go unnoticed.
I just found out my brother in law's wife was cheating on him. And guess who it was with? My friggin' brother!
I immediately did! Holy hell it is indeed some serious drama.
I sure hope so! I'm so pissed off at my brother for this.
I accidentally peed all over the front of my pants last weekend when I was at a restaurant.
Yeah_comma_ my belt fell in front when I was using the bathroom and it splashed everywhere. I had to dry it off on the air dryer.
I got best employee award last month!!
I work for a bank. It was due to automation idea i gave. Just sprang out of my mind. due to that they gave me. It was quite surreal
So the first time I ever went to donate blood_comma_ after I signed up I instantly regretted it. I was soo worried about that big needle_comma_ and when it finally came time? It wasn't even a big deal_comma_ it was soo easy.
Thank you! I felt a lot better after having done it. Do you know what blood type you are? I'm O+_comma_ so I feel like I really aught to donate more.
Hi_comma_ guess what just happened to me?
I won a new car!
I was fired today from my job. I was about to qualify for a good retirement package and they let me go for no reason.
Yes it seems like that. I'm going to get a lawyer and see what I can do.
My girlfriend secretly booked a cruise for us next week. She told me today.
haha_comma_ hers.
haha she is.
I'm no loner and I love hanging out with my friends.  But for me true Nirvana is when I've got my own space...because I feel that having peace of mind is a gift that most people take for granted.
Not exactly.  Had 2 girls over yesterday and it was pretty fun lol...all while ppl were messaging me on facebook
So my boss chose my coworker for a promotion instead of me. I felt like I work just as hard as he does_comma_ if not harder!
I didn't want to make things awkward_comma_ so I didn't. Hopefully I'll be next in line!
My parents just bought me a new car for my birthday!
It's the new Honda Civic. I woke up and looked outside and there was this bright red car with a bow on it.
I found out my sister is pregnant today! She's been trying for years
Yeah_comma_ I think its great.
I saw a little kid hit a bullseye at a shooting range with a .45 magnum.  He did it 3 times too_comma_ it was cool
that's what it said in the youtube video
Hi_comma_ I was on a carnival ride and something terrible happened to me!
The young person done puked. And it got all over me!
My son is graduating early. 
He is 17. He also got several scholarships. He's worked so hard for this.
I was camping last weekend and I heard an animal walking around outside out tent in the middle of the night.
No! When we got up we seen these large weird footprints like nothing we've seen before. I was speechless. 
Yesterday I was walking in the mall and my foot caught the edge of a carpet on the floor_comma_ I ended up tripping and busting my nose on the floor!
I feel like my ego was hurt more than my nose_comma_ but yes_comma_ it hurt like hell!
I feel sad and kind of guilty when I see old pics of my late Grandma.
Yeah I wasn't there for the funeral cuz she was all the way in the Philippines...but looking through photos brings back good memories too
There's a job opening at the law firm that I've always wanted to work at.
Thanks. I applied and will keep my fingers crossed!
I'm amazed at how far I've come in life...from being a loser living at my parents' house not contributing anything to society..to being a self-employed entrepreneur paying my own bills and rent in Texas
Thanks for your support :) what do you do for a living
 I visited an aviation show yesterday and was absolutely amazed by the skill involved!
Im so aggravated.  I think im going to cancel my cable service
I got a larger than expected bill for my cable this month. so I called them to see what was up and I had to wait on hold for 20 minutes.  After that_comma_ the system just hung up on me.  
After long time i played soccer.  Am so bad at it now_comma_ i used to be good
hopefully_comma_ i was really really bad though infront of friends
I used to hate it when girls wouldn't text me back.  Now that I'm focused on my job and networking I put little to zero effort in meeting girls...and as a result they're the ones checkin up on me every night lmao
Yup exactly... but I feel like even "acting" disinterested can be pretty transparent since girls are super intuitive...just staying busy and being constantly on your grind turns them on...for me personally anyway how bout you
A friend of mine let me try Korea snacks made with seaweed. I wasn't sure at first_comma_ but I ended up loving them! Paint me surprised.
They have salted seaweed that is crunchy and sort of like a potato chip. It's really good!
I haven't tried it with a dip_comma_ but it's great just as is.
I loved getting to see my best friend unexpectedly_comma_ I never get enough time with her. I cherished every minute!
Aw that sucks_comma_ I hope you get to see your best friend soon! It's always so good to catch up and talk about memories.
I agree! We also made bracelets for each other like old times lol
Do you ever see someone and feel like you are transported back in time to a specific place and moment?
its crazy! I ran into my ex at the grocery store.  She has kids now_comma_ so that was weird.  We talked about some of our old memories.  It was fun thinking about the past and imagining what could have been.
Man_comma_ some people are just nasty. One time my cousin had an infected toe_comma_ and he would not wash his hands after touching it.
Lol_comma_ I wouldn't doubt it_comma_ especially since he stuck the same finger he used to touch his toe_comma_ right into his mouth. It was so gross to watch. And then afterwards he went to the fridge and started touching all kinds of items in there.
My 30th birthday is soon and I am actually looking forward to it!
I feel like if I convince myself I'm looking forward to it then I have no time to dread it!
I just purchased the Oculus Rift virtual reality system! I can't wait to get it and try it out!
I know I will.  I am pumped up about this thing!
My neighbor lets his dog wonder freely around the neighborhood. I honestly wouldn't care much if his dog wouldn't poop on my friggin' lawn all the time.
I haven't done anything yet_comma_ but it becoming annoying enough that if it happens one more time I'll give him a call.
I love who I am now.  But I'm livid at my older self_comma_ that guy was a deadbeat and I'd probably beat the crap out of him haha
Yup agreed 100%
Im worried that I am going to get fired at work.  I dont know what to do.
Just found out that my partner at work submitted our project_comma_ but most of his work was stolen.  I didn’t know that he did this_comma_ but I feel ashamed and embarrassed.
I went parachuting and had to pull my secondary parachute due to a malfunction in the first. I was FREAKING out.
It did! That's the first thing that came to mind right before pulling it; "PLEASE let this one work!".
I think I will_comma_ but it'll be a while before I do!
I'm stoked for my EP release.  Still working on it but I'm 7 songs deep and feel like a lot of people will vibe with it
Yes thank you.
Man_comma_ you ever do something stupid in front of a whole crowd of people?
Haha_comma_ I know the feel. Once in High School I was trying to find a seat at a football game_comma_ and I tripped and fell in front of a whole bunch of people. They all started laughing at me too.
Went out to lunch and no one ever came over to greet let alone seat us_comma_ what a waste.
No_comma_ by the time we got there and back into the car_comma_ it was time to head back to work.
I'm not antagonistic but if someone disrespects me in front of my friends and family or tries to start a fight I'll be ready to knock him out cold or snap his arm
Yup what goes around comes around
every week i have a laundry list of things i need to get when i get paid. then pay day comes and it's gone in a second.
it is really hard to always be broke
i am so scared to carry cash because the way society has become
i went to a job meeting and a couple of people were late so we had to sit and wait for them! i was so mad
i know! Like_comma_ can you be professional and show up on time?
I'm saving up for a new vehicle so I've been driving around an old ugly green truck in the mean time. It's a bit embarrassing being seen in it.
I've got to say_comma_ for an old truck it rarely gives me trouble and runs great! It's a 1995 Chevy.
How can i not be  made at her when my wife wasted all my retirement money
Yes_comma_ I just checked my account and realized I am broke :(
No I will make her pay for what she did to me 
I will make her work to pay my children's tuition in Yale when they graduate I will divorce her
I lost my favorite pocket knife
I guess I can always buy another.
Yeah but_comma_ it won't be quite the same.
This is very true.
I have had a break up recently. I feel so empty
I have had a break up recently. I feel so empty
My daughter is aggravating me over not being allowed to be on the computer.
She just isn't allowed to be on it on school days.
My husband got a promotion_comma_ it's going to be great for our family!
Thank you so much_comma_ I'm so glad he's worked as hard as he has. 
It's rough getting older. I'm about to be 35 and I've never had a girl friend. I have a couple friends in the same boat as well.
Not even once. I've never done anything intimate with anyone in my life_comma_ lol. My friends stress out about it_comma_ but I think I've come to just accept that we're not all made to find someone.
I was supposed to take this trip I am on with my friend but they could not make it. I decided to come by myself. Im really missing friends right about now.
I hope so. Its just hard not having someone you know from back home with you.
My cousin died in a car crash.
I feel terrible.
Thanks_comma_ I will.
i was driving down a back road to work and there was a dead skunk
it was roadkill and it stunk to high heaven
literally. haha it was really rank smelling
Man_comma_ I know it's for the best_comma_ but I don't know if I'm ready to join the Air Force.
Well_comma_ I just don't know if I'm physically fit enough for Basic Training. And it's hard imagining signing a contract for 4 years. But_comma_ I know it'll be better in the end_comma_ it'll set me up with a good job and good work experience.
So okay_comma_ hear me out. I was at the post officer the other day and I had to wait in line for the ONE pen the post office seems to have. Why only one pen?
I guess like ten minutes. It's not that long_comma_ but you shouldn't have to wait! And then it's chained to a pole like they're really protective of it. Oh yeah_comma_ and the ink is almost always out by the time you get to it.
My mom is so awesome_comma_ she cleaned my house for me while I was away on business.
I didn't but she got some big hugs for the gesture!
I found some photos of the spring break trip I took when I was 18.
It was pretty great. Its strange how young we all looked.
Tell me about it.  We went from kids to married with kids.
The new Smash Bros direct came out today_comma_ and they revealed 5 characters that people have been wanting for years!
Yup! The first one came out when I was in like middle school. So it's crazy finally getting a character you wanted in the game over 10 years later.
It's like a fighting game_comma_ but some people call it a "party game"_comma_ but basically it's a fighting game with all kinds of Nintendo characters. You have stuff like Mario_comma_ Donkey Kong_comma_ Link_comma_ Zelda_comma_ Pikachu_comma_ etc etc. So every time a new game comes out_comma_ people post online about who they want to see in it next. This new game is filled with characters and I think most people will be happy. The first game came out in 1999. Time sure flies. 
For sure_comma_ it's definitely worth playing. The first game was on the N64_comma_ the newest one is going to be on the Switch. If you have a Wii U or 3DS there's a Smash game on each of those. I love the game_comma_ I used to play in tournaments with my friends.
When I go to the gym with my girlfriend_comma_ she is always looking at the other guys. It makes me feel a bit weird.
Yeah_comma_ I guess so. I'm guilty of doing the same things now that I think about it.
Next Spring Break we will be going on a cruise to Cozumel. We have never been on one before.
We are so excited. My parents are taking us and my sisters family is going also. It is going to be so much fun.
I've been living alone for the last 5 years.
ITs got its pros and con's but i'm about tired of it.
No kids of my own but_comma_ I did find out that i'm going to be an uncle.   Except i'm not supposed to know that yet.
I discovered a family of rats living under my balcony. They give me the creeps!
Well I tried to scare them away but they almost attacked me! I had to run back in the house.
You ever have a dream that feels way too real? The other day I had a dream where I was a kid again and I was with my family and everything was peaceful and happy.
Yea_comma_ I do_comma_ but it was strained for a while. It got real bad between them and it led to me honestly hating them both. It really sucked because I enjoyed my childhood a lot. It's nice that it's better now_comma_ but it's still not what it used to be. I actually woke up crying from that dream_comma_ lol.
Yea_comma_ for sure. Thanks for hearing me out_comma_ it can feel good to get things off your chest_comma_ and I really don't have anyone else to tell something like that too. None of our relatives know about the issues they had and I try to be a rock for my friends_comma_ so I don't usually have someone to tell my sob stories to. I hope you have a wonderful life!
I walked up on a snake in my yard a couple of days ago.
I killed it_comma_ and burned it.
I just love little kids.
Not yet. I am going to become certified to work in a daycare though. I love being around little kids
I hope not for me lol
That's true
I clean my house every week and last time I had to clean my toilet_comma_ I almost threw up.

I took my daughter shopping today

Her feet have always bben bigger but now the rest of her is catching up
it was the best feeling ever watching my son graduate school

I cooked a delicious looking plate of scrambled eggs with ham on top_comma_ but when I melted cheese on top of it all_comma_ I hadn't noticed the cheese was bad until it was too late.
Luckily I had a pizza in the oven for my kids. I ended up just stealing a piece of that instead. Either way_comma_ so frustrating and disappointing!

i took a pregnancy test just to find out it was negative
no. just the opposite. at least for me.

This is going to sound silly_comma_ but yesterday I realized when I went to change a diaper that I could not find a single baby wipe in the house. I didn't know what to do and did not have a car until my fiance gets home from work later that night. I was scared I wouldn't have a way to like.. change diapers!
NO YOU DIDNT! I would use my fiances old yucky gym shorts before I go for a kitchen towel! Yikes! Lol

Yes_comma_ I know I have to let him grow up_comma_ but he is my baby and I want to know he will make the right choices. Sometimes it is the other kids you have to worry about more and the influence they have when they are starting high school.

My dog took a crap on my new rug yesterday.
I know! I was very irritated cleaning it up_comma_ but I quickly got over it. She is in the learning process after all.

I was at a restaurant tonight and watched this man eat 5 plates of foods from the buffet. It was gross.
Ha ha_comma_ no.  I could understand seafood but this was piles of meat and potatoes and then a plates piled with desserts.  How can a stomach take it?
My son_comma_ the devious scamp_comma_ stole 50 cookies from the cookie jar tonight. Never been so disappointed in him.
Well_comma_ I was off to the freshly stocked cookie jar and there were none left! I figured his aching stomach was punishment enough. His agony was quite palpable.

There's nothing better than 90s cartoons.
I felt very sad for someone I know who has a mental illness and works so hard sometimes to get better..but then other times they destroy it all.
Yes..but it's even harder on the caregivers... I felt very compassionate for them today though ...as here they are working hard again. The rollercoaster is not easy...I feel sad for them today.
Caregivers mean anyone who takes care of them..In this case me.
I ate the last ramen we had.

My biggest pet peeve is litterbugs. I want to go up to them and scold them for not respecting the environment.
Yeah_comma_ maybe someone should litter in their house so they can see how it feels. And don't get me started on cigarette butts...
Saw a person who seemed very sick and unhealthy..spit in their hands..sneeze in them..sling it everywhere..then touch the doorhandle to the store

I've been stealing my neighbor's internet for awhile now. Feel kinda bad about it.
Yeah_comma_ I know. But it's just something I know I should be paying for.
My friends didn't invite me out drinking last weekend. They didn't even bother texting me!
Yeah_comma_ they said they forgot but I think it's because there a guy I don't get along with that went with them. I'm still pissed though.
My dog peed on the carpet today. I was so peeved.

Applied to another unit and got it.
I'm in med/surg now. I'm changing for the higher pay.
My friend is pregnant with her 6th kid
I know she's always wanted a big family_comma_ but I didn't know she meant 6 kids big.

I am not sure why...but ever since my body changed so much in pregnancy..and I am having to work so hard to get it back to normal..somedays I am just uncomfortable and don't want to wear anything and I don't want to go out
I have! It is just something different after you get pregnant..and I was very sick and had a lot of health issues..I have lost most of the weight- It just changes you and your body for some of us-
I have my math final tomorrow and I am so nervous about it.

I got some fast food today and it was sooo good!
Oh lord...The bad one..mcdonalds! lol- I can't have wheat so I can't eat much..I wanted nuggets SO bad too..I don't eat it often..but junk food tastes nice now and again.

I do not know...I am creeped out as he had two dogs who he was VERY close too...and they just disappeared..I fear he is starving them and locking them inside..he is mentally ill for a few months now- And he says strange things..yells at me..But I am not surethe police will come check on him..They are So corrupt here...And also what can they do if he doesn't answer the door?
No....No one talks to him..He doesn't have a car or a job..In fact I'm not sure how he even survives. He worked for awhile before. Most of my other neighbors won't talk to him because he has been "bipolar" with them. I asked him where his dogs went a few days ago..and he said they were "fine"...yet he never lets them out? ....I don't know what I can do??

My neighbor always interrupts me when I talk.

I was watching a TV show where people were eating cockroachs. I wanted to throw up.
I could finish watching the TV show. I had to switch channel.
My wife is going to divorce me.
She cheated on me_comma_ I am so sad over it.
My interest rate just went up on my credit card.
No_comma_ I've been great about it.  I am so mad it happened.
I'm always envious of really beautiful girls_comma_ I wish I could look that way.
Thanks but I really don't feel like it.
Omg_comma_ the day I found out I was pregnant with my second child was so amazing.
We had been trying for over a year when it happened. We thought we would never have another one.
Thanks. That was 3 years ago now he is a crazy little boy running all over
I helped my brother study for his final exam. He studied really diligiently with me every day. But in the end on the actual exam he managed to fail it!
I know. I'm just so annoyed at all the time we spent...
Yeah he got way too nervous and I guess the situation was different than he was expecting.
I had some tests done at the doctors yesterday_comma_ hopefully i hear good news
just feeling exhausted at all times
i lost my job today. was not my fault we got robbed

I am looking forward for the new pizza joint to open up here.
They will make New York style.  I can't wait to eat there!
I fell asleep at work yesterday.
No_comma_ but I am so ashamed that it happened.
My son went into the backyard on his own yesterday_comma_ pulled his pants down_comma_ and proceeded to pee all over the grass.
Ha I was pumped! He loves imitating the dog_comma_ and it's a lot easier for him to do that than me change 8 diapers all day!
I have total trust in my wife. We are good couple.
It is always good to have someone that will help you in time of needs.
I have a cut on the bottom of my foot and man is it a nuisance trying to walk.
No_comma_ it's just a little cut that needs to heal.
I enjoy looking at old pictures and remebering past memories
Yeah it's nice looking back
Someone took my laptop from my car.
I know right! I am so angry someone stole it!
yesterday a stranger tried to rob me 
i am shaken up but luckily a security guard at the club saw the whole thing as stopped it
I am really looking forward to the upcoming football season.
No_comma_ I am just a football fan.  I can't wait for it to start!

At this age_comma_ they learn so quickly. That is nice.
Years ago me and my best friend got into a bad argument and I felt terrible later because I realized it was my fault
Yes_comma_ it took awhile_comma_ a couple months I think it was but we are closer now
I am looking forward to going to the cinema this upcoming weekend.

Oh yes that is the movie I think. I love them too. Should be fun.
I went to the Olive Garden for dinner.
Yeah_comma_ I was satisfied with the food and service.
Some one lied to my girl friend
He was a friend
I don't want to keep such friends 
i walked out of the restroom on a blind date and my zipper was dowdn
she noticed but brought it to my attention discreetly....we were on a double date..haha
I'm kinda iffy about this weekend
Going to the amusement park.  Have never rode a rollercoaster before :/
Yeah I'll just have to try it out I guess
I tried to meet some friends yesterday but they were all busy.
I end up staying alone at home watching some movies. It was little bit boring.
My friend is not feeling well today.  
Yes. Though he is not feeling well_comma_ I am fortunate that he gave me his tickets to the Kid Rock concert tonight.
My sister got into a bad car accident.
She will be_comma_ I am so sad that it happened.
I saw a man eat an entire birthday cake.
I know_comma_ it was really inspiring.
Yesterday_comma_ my 4 year prepared a gift for my birthday. It was so cute.
I was very suprised that he could remember my birthday.
my food that was delvered was deliverd incorrect_comma_ but by the time it got here the restraunt was already close.
i couldnt eat it. it was a mess
I have to make a 6 foot sub for my coworkers.
Oh_comma_ it's just a pot luck.  I am so ready to get it done.
I didn't think anyone remembered_comma_ however_comma_ I came home to concert tickets that my friend got for me.
Yes.  He got me tickets to Kid Rock concert tonight. 
My friend was scheduled to work with me the other day and I was really excited.
I'm a firefighter_comma_ but when I got there_comma_ they had shipped him somewhere else so that sucked.
My dentist did an awesome job on my teeth_comma_ I love them!
I really am_comma_ I had bad teeth my entire life because of genetic reasons.
Why do I have to explain to everyone about my preferences?
you know_comma_ man and woman thing but I am a woman and I prefer women
I just proposed to my girlfriend and she said yes!
Next year_comma_ I am so happy!
At work_comma_ while standing up_comma_ my pants teared in the back. I didn't know what to do.
It was embarring. Some coworker were watching me. I had to go to my manager to ask him if I could home.
I accidentally spilled coffee on my pants yesterday.
No_comma_ it got everywhere.  I was so ashamed to do that.
Hello there! So I just finished high school and retook maths in my final year because I didn't do well it the year before
Well I got the same result in both years because I'm lazy... so I didn't get into the university I wanted and I let my parents down which was shameful :(
Well_comma_ I got into my other university which is great_comma_ however it's not the university I wanted. How about you_comma_ what's your story?
Yesterday_comma_ two gangs were fighting just in front of my home. It is a very scary situtation.
In the house_comma_ no one got hurt but outside the house_comma_ many of them got hurt. They were using knifes and baseball bats.
My boyfriend broke up with me and I understand but I miss him a lot. I liked having him around_comma_ he always made me laugh and not feel like I was doing everything on my own.
Nah_comma_ I'm doing that whole no contact thing that people suggest.
Thank you_comma_ I know I'll be fine eventually. It's just a rough go right now!
During an argument_comma_ my wife told that I am not the real father of my son. I am so angry.
I don't know. I am thinking how I can verify that.
I am waiting for my medical tests to come back.
Somewhat_comma_ but I am confident they will come back okay.
A couple months ago I was on my way home from just buying a brand new truck and got in a wreck.
Yes_comma_ it definitely is. And_comma_ it was not even my fault!
My wife want to divorce. I need to prepare myself to not be in very bad financial situation.
I am fine with getting divorce but she trying to get as much money as possible from this divorce.
A pit bull was chasing me as I was walking home.
Yes but I was scared I was going to die.
The start of school is soon_comma_ I'm ready to get back to work!
Yeah_comma_ I love the feeling of keeping busy during the school year.
We finished out our fiscal year at my job recently and had performance reviews around the end of it. 
I think okay! I had to meet certain goals tied to my compensation and I thought I would hit them and I did! 
I'm trying for a promotion this coming February.
I think that I will. It would mean a 25% raise.
i was scared walking home the other night
someone walked behind me the entire way
I am feeling old!
I suppose it's all relative.  I realized it has been almost 25 years since I graduated from high school.
How long ago did you graduate from high school?
Yesterday was my mom's birthday
Yeah!  I went to her house yesterday (she lives about 30 mins from me) and I cooked her a catfish dinner!
It was delicious!  Wish you could've been there!
Chaperoning a school dance recently reminded me of my own school dances I went to. I always had a great time.
I loved dancing the night away with good friends.
I was nervous at first in the spelling bee...but ended up taking first place out of 100 plus kids
Yes it was pretty hard actually
I just back from taking a ride in my boss' new car
He bought a corvette and man does that thing have some serious power under the hood.
I received a package yesterday and the contents were destroyed!
I just don't understand how inconsiderate some of these delivery companies can be.
At work_comma_ I saw a coworker pick their nose and eat it.
It was so gross!
Yesterday_comma_ after having dinner_comma_ my partner left her dishes unwashed. It was very disgusting thing for her to do
No she was not. She was just behaving very irresponsibly. It is not the first time happening though
I'm really looking forward for the new Greek restaurant to open here.
It's really good.  I can't wait to try it!
MY 5 year old acted so mature when I dropped her off for her first day of school
I was nervous ands she was perfectly fine
I know. I hope this lasts forever!
I have been waiting for my union members points to come in the mail so I can get two free movie tickets. Ive been wanting to see the new Jurassic Park movie and can't wait!
My Fiance is a part of a union for communications workers and they have rewards points you get to redeem for different things. The points and perks alone arent worth the union fees in my opinion but he wants to be a part of it so
We have movie night on Friday
I don't know yet. Its my daughter turn. The kids always pick gun movies
I meant fun movies not gun movies lol
I've been a little nervous lately and I don't know why exactly.
I'm really not sure_comma_ it's just a general type of thing.
I was flying to see a relative_comma_ and my flight got delayed because of weather! Once I got on it and flew to the next airport_comma_ I missed my connection because of the first delay. Now I have to stay in the airport all alone_comma_ overnight_comma_ sleeping on the ground like a dog.
This was yesterday! I just recently was able to move on to my final destination. It was kind of neat to people-watch and see the goofy things that happen in an airport overnight_comma_ but it was still miserable overall.
My best friend and I had been roommates all through college.
We each just moved out on our own over the summer. I really miss living with her.
I gambled away a large chunk of money my grandmother left to me when she died. I thought I could put down most of it and double it_comma_ and pay for my college. I thought it was a sure thing_comma_ and now I have none of it
It was... I went on the advice of my best friend_comma_ who knows horse racing. He's never given me advice like that before_comma_ so I figured he just felt really confident about it_comma_ otherwise he wouldn't say anything. I mean_comma_ I still can take out student loans_comma_ I just should have been smarter about this.
I was sitting on a plane next to an older man_comma_ who was telling me about how he had just visited his father_comma_ but that it was sad because he has dementia and didn't remember him anymore. I was trying to comfort him_comma_ mostly because I worry it will happen to my dad_comma_ too.
Yeah. We grow up thinking they're invincible. And then as we get older_comma_ we see that picture deteriorate little by little. And then when they get old and need help_comma_ a lot of the time we don't have time or money to help them_comma_ so it's just stressful and sad all the way around.
I really_comma_ really need to leave my job because it's making me miserable_comma_ but I'm afraid to make a big change.  I'm worried about financial stability for me and my kids_comma_ and nervous about leaving a known quantity for an unknown.
Yes.  And the tricky part is that you can choose to stay in the miserable job for financial/life stability_comma_ and then be crabby and unhappy around your kids_comma_ or you can take the risk and maybe be in a worse financial place but be happier at home.  It's tough.  
My boyfriend is really getting on my nerves lately.
Every time we go out_comma_ he is always talking to other girls.
My friend showed me a text this guy sent her that shes been talking to. They were talking about where they live in comparison to eachother. The text said "Yeah_comma_ and your fat" and I thought wow how rude! But after that he corrected the auto correct saying he meant to say "Yeah_comma_ and your far. He must have felt so bad lol
Yeah he was probably like_comma_ "aw shucks another one lost to the stupid auto correct_comma_ is good grammar really worth it?" HAHA
I can't wait for Saturday!
I'm going to an MMA show in Louisville.  There's going to be a bunch of awesome fights!
I'm sure I will.  I can't wait!
I am so sick of cleaning up after everyone! I cleaned the whole house last week.
No one will even help keep it clean by picking up after themselves. They have undone all the work I did by leaving messes everywhere.
I'm hoping to buy a home this fall.  I recently met with a loan officer about a mortgage.  He was very highly recommended by my realtor_comma_ so I thought the meeting would go well.  I was really disappointed when I didn't like the guy and he wasn't helpful at all.
Yes_comma_ it was a real bummer.  Now I have to search around for someone else to help me get a mortgage.  It's a drag when personal recommendations don't work out.
My fiance took a new job about a year ago_comma_ and he would eventually get his own work vehicle after the 6 months of training. After that long time of him having the car all day I am happy that his training is over and he gets his work truck and I get the car back!
Yes I do! Then on the other hand I don't have an excuse when I really dont want to get up and do something too. Double edge sword I guess
I was pretty upset at my friend when he ran away from a fight.  I was actually standing up for him against two guys talking crap but he ran away like a little wuss
Thanks.  Got 6 stitches on my face from a corona bottle when they blindsided me lol...but I still managed to knock out one of them so I was happy
I am super intrigued to try a few new supplements I have learned about.
Chlorella_comma_ Bitter Apricot and Wheatgrass. All should help me detox_comma_ get my gut in line and give me some much needed vitamins I can absorb.
I wasn't but I have been trying to stay on organic for years..when you get older and get health problems and doctors only want to ignore you or prescribe pills and make it worse- It's good to research and help yourself.
The week has been going better. 
Yes! Other people always trying to make life stink lol. No big upsets_comma_ no drama. I hope it continues
I'm feeling ready for Fall to arrive.
I hate summer. It's just too hot.
I was just thinking of my grandmother who passed away 10 years ago. She left me her bible as a reminder. I like reading from it sometimes.
Its a great reminder of her. I used to always see her reading from it in the afternoons.
My kids have been home with me the past couple of weeks (we're doing minimal summer camp)_comma_ and they've been driving each other crazy this week. Yesterday they argued so many times that I got pretty frustrated and angry.  It was a tough day.
Yes_comma_ it's been rough.  I have a ton of work to do for my day job (working from home mostly this summer)_comma_ and other stressful things going on_comma_ so I'm not doing a great job of keeping them entertained.  
It is a GOOD day_comma_ money is okay_comma_ paycheck day and there is peace! 
I know right? Especially in my world. I was not looking forward to this day all week but now it's peaceful_comma_ so it's great
I ran out of my favorite makeup and can't afford to buy more right now_comma_ what a bummer.
I haven't but that might be a good idea for me to try out!
I saw something near impossible...some Indian monks taking turns dragging forward a Subaru in neutral by their testicles...looked painful but hey it beats calling AAA I guess 
It's a documentary about the Aghori Sadhus you should check it out if you're bored lol
My police force is so corrupt.
No- I would never want to be- They are too corrupt here. My neighbor has not come out of his house or let his dogs out in days. I am sure they won't do anything! They don't even show for gun shots..rape..beatings etc.
I am a woman lol- I live in Michigan..in one of the most dangerous cities in the USA- Saving to move...Yes I think cops are getting worse everywhere- They seem to think they can do anything..and btw they can usually and not even get fired even when they shoot people in the back
I am feeling very empathetic to someone this week who sometimes I just want to run over! lol 
They are mentally ill and the mood swings can be a bit much and seem intentional...as they tend to take it out on me..When they are being good though..it's hard not to be compassionate
Someone hit my car in the parking lot at the mall.
They did have cameras_comma_ but they were not working that day! and the person did not leave a note.
once I fell on a nail_comma_ And my leg was cut wide open I could see deep into my leg.
I almost did actually_comma_  I had to just look away and pretend nothing happened!
My father passed away. He left me his favorite watch. I like to wear it often to serve as a reminder of how great he was.
Yea it sort of makes me happy when I wear it. I can still see him getting dressed in the morning and putting that watch on.
So yesterday i had a deadline for a project at work. I got started really late and didnt think i was going to make it.
I did. But i had to rush and really hammer at it. 
Glad you were able to finish. I know that's a lot of pressure.
I really was expecting my loan to be approved.  I couldn't believe it when they told me I wasn't approved.
Yes! maybe for a little less money.  but I really really need it.
I walked up on a snake in my back yard a few days ago.
Yes_comma_ I'm fine. I do live in the country. I killed it.
After shopping at Walmart_comma_ upon leaving I saw a homeless man sleeping near the entrance. I was so sad to see the man in that situation
I think there should be some kind of social services to help them come out of this situation
i refused to compromise my stand in honesty
thats not polite ! anyway ive learnt the hard way
I got a hand written thank you note from a co-worker in another department.
For doing a good job.
I just arrived in a new country after traveling for two months. There arent many people in the new place I am staying. I am starting miss my friends and home.
I just got to Vietnam. When I was in Thailand I met so many people. Now I just cant stop thinking of home. 
This cutie I met at the buffet yesterday somehow found me on Facebook...thought she used a receipt at first_comma_ but then remembered I paid in cash...wasn't expecting that lol
I did and she still hasn't told me lol...still msging me too it's kinda funny
I was working on a house and a whole section of it was infested with roaches. It was the scariest thing I've ever experienced with bugs. I hate them!
There were thousands of them and I have never seen it like that.  My skin crawls just thinking about it!
My son is 17 and a high school junior.
He just informed me that he is dropping out. I have tried convincing him to finish though.
I can't seem to get my budget under control and it's really harming me.
For life
gave her a task she did not fulfil 
i gave a subordinate a project but she blatanatly declined
I was at a work dinner and I wanted to help open an expensive wine bottle. By mistake_comma_ it fell. I felt bad about it.
I understand but it is a little bit embarrassing.
Feeling a bit scared about the weekend.
Why?
I understand. Did you try getting out with friends?
I ordered a vacuum from a company online on a warehouse deal..and even though it was inspected..the power button didn't work unless you held it IN!
I am not keeping something broken. I really needed a vacuum days ago though! So that was really irritating! Dealing with the CS took awhile and was a pain
Well I am waiting until tomorrow now for a vacuum because I don't want to talk to anymore CS- but it's ALSO annoying that I have to wait for my refund :/ Yes! I needed a vacuum days ago and this wasn't a new one..so it was supposed to be inspected. I avoid CS like the plague and YEP they do outsource to other countries where the people can be very rude
I was planning on meeting up with my father for the first time in a few years since we had a falling out. We had a tentative meeting to see each other at the end of the week_comma_ but he's already canceled.
Yeah_comma_ oh well. He's a pretty introverted guy_comma_ so when we got into a big falling out back then_comma_ I kind of figured he wouldn't be able to face me again.
I was walking on the sidewalk and came across a rotted deer corpse
I was sick to my stomache when I saw it
My son graduated from high school and is starting college for engineering next week.
So very!  I wasn't sure he knew what he wanted to do for a while and might take a break but no_comma_ he went right into applying and decided pretty quickly on what he wanted to do in life.  I'm excited for him.
I don't know why some people waste their talents and life.
Family in a way. That is great that you have grown as a person! It is rare. They complain when they have things good and still aren't happy when it's bad?- I don't get it- I don't get people who want to stay in misery
I'd still take a bullet for my ex and her family. Even though she blocked me on Facebook. Call me a sucker but that girl was my first love and she gave me so much I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for her
Yes I messed up and ruined a good thing.  I was stressed at my job and took it out on her.  But I'm now self-employed living the dream and just wish she was still by my side
Im nervous about accepting a job offer I just received. I noticed a couple red flags while I was interviewing.
Well it sounds like I will be working really long hours without getting paid overtime. It doesnt seem like the salary offered will be worth the amount of time I will be at the office.
My girlfriend is going through a tough process of finding a job after graduating. She's hearing a lot of "no's." She's going to an interview later today for a job she really wants_comma_ and I'm worried it will be another no. Trying to make sure the evening is nice and comfortable afterwards to ease the pain_comma_ if there is any.
Yeah_comma_ that's exactly what I thought about doing. It's just weird cause there's only so many times I can say the same lines about how she just has to be patient and to not take it personal_comma_ and all that stuff. I just try not to be annoying_comma_ I guess.
Oh no the thai place is closed today_comma_ where will we eat now?
I guess we could go eat BBQ or something else. What sounds good?
I am happy today I can feed my birds and get everything I need and there is no drama.
Oh I meant wild birds_comma_ and squirrels etc_comma_ I just think of them as mine :)
yes! I can't wait to move to the country and feed even more critters- It is one of the most enjoyable things in life to me
My pet turtle died.
Usually they're not too maintenence intensive.
Looking forward to getting my new vacuum for the SECOND time tomorrow. 
The one they sent me wouldn't turn on and I needed a vacuum badly.  I hope it works..I swear I will cry if it doesn't.
Yes! Great reviews. The former one just wasn't inspected even though it said it was. Stuff happens_comma_ but really I need a vacuum and it's cheaper to get them online
I had a really great job interview. I thought it went well and would receive and offer. They called today to say they went with someone else. Im a little upset.
Im starting to learn that. I just got my hopes up was all. Well on to the next one I guess.
I'm really ready for Fall weather.
I live in the South_comma_ so I know what you mean.
I'm not a greedy person.  But free cash is always a pleasant surprise. It gives me peace of mind to know that my bills will be paid and I have one less worry in my mind.
Nope
my son has prepared so much for his presentation_comma_ i believe he's going to do well
a new product his company is about to market. his present the marketing plan to the board of directors
I'm really happy where my life is right now.
A few_comma_ but mostly just getting to a more comfortable age. I'm 50.
So my car broke down a few weeks ago and my friend has been giving me rides lately
Yes_comma_ it will be a long process. I'm so lucky to have her as a friend in the meanwhile.
She's a life saver indeed!
My heart is broken. My wife has left me.
Yes. I had no idea she was not happy.
I am going on a cruise next month with some friends.
We are going to the Bahamas. I cannot wait! It is going to be so fun!
It's crazy how the big changes in my life I thought were catastrophes ended up being catalysts for a better future.  I'm thankful for all of them.
My ex broke up with me 6 months ago.  But since then I've been self-employed_comma_ gaining full autonomy of time_comma_ and have a bunch of hot girls randomly texting me it's pretty surreal hahaha
I am currently waiting for my grades to be released. I took a final on Monday. Ive been pacing around like crazy waiting to hear what I made.
Thanks. I really need the time to hurry up and pass.
Both of my daughters are musicians.
Yes_comma_ I play guitar as a hobby. My oldest is a violinist_comma_ my youngest is a pianist.
i gave birth to a beautiful princess
yes i am a Queen_comma_ am so excited_comma_ my husband both a special gift for me after my delivery
Limo
The other day I came home after a long day of work_comma_ and my husband had left work a bit early and cleaned the entire house! 
Yeah it was awesome! Especially because we had had company over so the place was in need of it for sure
I applied for a job last week.
At a hair salon. I need this job so bad. I will find out next week.
My life is not where I want it to be yet...but I know I'm on the right path because I've got full autonomy of time and I'm living it to the fullest so I know I'm on the right track
Because I just paid rent_comma_ took care of bills_comma_ tire rotation_comma_ and still have time to hit the gym 6 days a week and feel like Bruce Wayne
I've always been able to trust my wife and daughters.
No_comma_ we're still good. I'm just proud of that.
am still expecting a call from the new company i to an interview for. i still believe i will get the job
yes it will_comma_ i have strong believe
I'm 100% positive in my capabilities that I can make a billion dollars in a year.  It's my time to shine and I'm gonna get it nothing can stop me
Yes I know I can.
My mom got back on her feet very quickly after leaving her abusive boyfriend. I'm amazed my her determination.
She is!
my spouse just gave me a surprise gift_comma_ my heart is filled with so much joy 
he bought a house for me. OMG is an edifice_comma_ i can't help it_comma_ am over happy
We are expecting severe weather tonight. 
Possible tornadoes. I have cleaned out a safe spot in the basement and filled a tote with food and emergency supplies just in case.
I was visiting my parents in my old home town. I passed in front the movie theater where I used to work. I remember having so much fun there.
Just goofing off with all my friends. No real worries. It was cool to see it looked the same as 20 years ago.
my son is taking his promotional exams i believe so much in him. he has prepared well enough to be the best
yes he will_comma_ he's always doing well
hey... i just found out i didnt get the promotion i thought i was getting
thanks i hope so!!! another one of my coworkers got it... and i was sure it was going to be me!!!
well that sounds nice! are you doing marketing or something?
I live the life of my dreams.  As a result I've got a lot of haters so I'm always ready to knock out a jealous little punk who tries crossing me at all times
Yes I have a feeling you're gonna be a winner.  
I'm looking forward to my daughter's fall concert.
I look forward to them every year.
I rode on an airplane last week and there was so much turbulence!
Yes_comma_ I was so on edge. It was not fun!
that is in my childhood at the game park
yeah_comma_ the side effect is shown now
My daughter has been sick and I've been taking care of her.
Not long_comma_ but I love her so much. That's what parents do! 
My girlfriend got tickets to a sold out concert this weekend for my birthday. I had no idea she did that. She kept a secret.
She played it off well because she told me it was sold out and she was unable to get them.
i regret watching horror movie last night because it kept me awake all through the night with much fear
i won't even try it again_comma_ i get scared at every sound
When my doughter was born I knew she would change my life. 
She is turning 2_comma_ being with her everyday brings me such joy.
This is the first time I drop my kids off to school and I know it'll be hard but I know the school si really good and the teachers are so wonderful.
Yes! I'm looking forward to what they will learn and experience.  It'll be a learning process for me to get used to not having them with me all the time.  I know it will be good for all of us though.
So the other week we were swimming and my one year old almost fell in the pool.
totally_comma_ my heart was beating so fast.
Exactly. I only looked away for 2 seconds.
I keep thinking about my grandmother.
She passed away last year and I do not know how to cope with it.
My lottery ticket hit a bumper prize.
It's $10_comma_000. It took my breathe away.
This morning driving into work_comma_ people were refusing to use their blinker.
It is and soon it will be very unsafe on the roads
A woman that I work with just got promoted and also won a trip for two to New York that was an office contest. Some people get it all.
I really did!  It is an all expense paid trip for 6 days.  I haven't had a vacation in about 6 years.  I don't usually win contests though.
Hi_comma_ I made a mistake at work last week
It was a big deal to me_comma_ but I don't think anyone noticed.
Yes I guess I am.
There was this party that my best friend was throwing for a mutual friend of ours because she was moving away. I totally accidentally spilled wine on their light colored carpet. I was mortified because so many people were there_comma_ if it had just been my friend then I probably wouldnt have been such a big deal to me.
No but they weren't exactly helpful either. The host of the party and the girl she threw it for helped me try and clean it up best as I could but others were just passive and unhelpful.
It's amazing how much money I saved this month once I really put my mind to it.
It is a lifestyle change_comma_ that's for sure!
I found a brown recluse in my room this morning (a type of poisionous spider)

Have you ever walked into a room and knew you were the most interesting person there? 
Last night I walked into an event like I owned the place and gave off an aura that everyone wanted to be a part of.
So_comma_ the other day my four year old smashed my favorite figurine. 
Yes. I made him apologize and stay in his room with no toys for an hour.
They really do. I should have grounded him even.
I just found out that my parents are bringing my husband and I and my kids on a week long trip to Hawaii! 
To the smaller one_comma_ Kauai. We were shocked!  I have always wanted to go but we just never have money for vacations.

We are ok but I am not sure I can recover
My wife is trying to get a job at the hospital.
She wants to be a nurse She will find out if she gets in this week_comma_ fingers crossed

I'm going back to college at 36 and start next week.
I'm looking forward to it and a bit nervous but I don't usually get intimidated about new things like that.  I really want to get my nursing degree so its worth it.
I'm moving to the beach in 6 months and the anticipation is killing me!
I am hoping so.  I always love going there on vacation_comma_ and I hope I feel as relaxed living there as I do when I'm on vacation.

I was in the grocery store and my 3 year old blurted out_comma_ "Mommy_comma_ why is that lady so round?" I was mortified.
I just peeked back at the lady and I couldn't tell if she had heard or not but she was fairly close.  I know_comma_ usually I can catch them before they say something but not this time.  I just said loudly_comma_ "Honey_comma_ don't say things like that."
I proposed to my girlfriend 2 months ago. 
She did and  I knew at that time and for the rest of time she would be the only woman I would be with
He was lots of price at the maths competition_comma_and i  stood by him as he received the awards

My average in College was a C
Exactly_comma_ as long as you have that in hand_comma_ why push yourself for a better grade
I went to the store and took a small bunch of bananas without paying for them.  I feel really bad about it.
No_comma_ I can't afford to pay for them_comma_ so what's the point.
My husband has been travelling for work for years now and we just found out that he might be able to work from home anywhere in the world. I really want it to work out!
I guess we'll have to get used to each other all over again and then start some hobbies together.  We used to workout_comma_ hike_comma_ play tennis_comma_ and lots of other things so if he's able to actually do this; I'll have to start brushing up on things again!

I still use all of my mothers cooking pots. She passed away a few years ago. Its a great reminder of her.
Yes and she was very good at it. I can still see her cooking my favorite dishes when I use them. 
Someone gave my husband and I tickets to a concert and we can't wait to go_comma_ but my sister really loves the band we're seeing so I feel bad going too.
She did say she wanted us to have fun but she's been kind of quiet and evasive since then.  Maybe I'm reading into it.
"I was tired when I got home from work yesterday so I just sat on the couch for the rest of the evening and watched tv.
I was pretty happy to just watch tv and relax
I recently found out that my niece may be autistic.

I got promoted at work and I have only been there for about a year. I am really happy and surprised with what I have achieved.
I am very proud of myself and somewhat surprised.
A friend of mine is setting the bar really high by going to get her second masters degree.

Just seems like tensions are building from all of these foreign polices and newly imposed tariffs
Man_comma_ these candidate robo-calls are driving me nuts!
Some days I get 3 or 4. I don't even know how they got my number. I'll be so glad when election season is over!

I cheated on a Spanish test in High school.
No_comma_ but I do feel bad about doing it
My daughter has been at her grandparents' house this week. The house is so quiet and empty.

I was up all night studying for this history test.  Ive got this!
I went to a piano recital the other day and watched all the younger kids play. Then a young man started playing and he played the most complicated piece I've ever heard! Its amazing the talent some people have and amazing how people can write that kind of music too!
I took piano for 7 years and was pretty good but never really wanted to use it for anything so it kind of wasn't worth it.  I think this guy is trying to get into an orchestra.  It is inspiring!
I've been through a lot of hard times in life_comma_ but I know that God will bless me soon.
Thank you for that encouragement. I am trying to be as patient as I can be during these hard times.
I was left at the alter by the bride to be this weekend.
It was and still is.  I was left with the task of returning all the gifts.  All this in the midst of the worst pain I've ever felt in my life.
I had a doctor's appointment the other day and they cancelled it an hour before it was scheduled. I hate that!
I agree! No reason. And now I have to wait another two weeks for a new appointment. I'm so mad!
i was truly a party faithful_comma_had work rigorously for the election my party won
You can say that again! but the irony of it was that all the appointments i was promised never came through
I'm anxious for school to start again_comma_ It's my senior year of college!
Yeah! I can't wait for it to be over with_comma_ but I'm going to have to study hard this last year.
I was at a party with some friends and I could not remember my friend's husband's name to save my life.
I tried to play it off_comma_ but I was so embarrassed. I know he's told me what it is multiple times before.
Do you ever get really emotional about people and things youve never met?
I got really upset when I watched the finale of the office.  I felt like I was part of their team and when the whole thing was over I cried a little.  It was like I was losing some friends.
I just started taking my younger kids to an elderly assisted living home to try to brighten people's day. I think its important to show kindness to others and teach my kids that.
They really enjoy going there and the people absolutely light up when the kids come up to talk to them. So many of them have no family coming to visit.  I think it also helps kids not be afraid of older people who might have oxygen on or something.
One of my coworkers got the promotion I'd been vying for. I'm trying to be happy for her.
Yeah. I'm trying not to be jealous_comma_ but it isn't working. I really wanted that job.
I just noticed my neighbor pull in with a brand new camper. That thing is so nice. I wish I could afford one like that...
I should. I'd love to see the inside. I'm quite envious of him right now_comma_.

My dog almost always goes to bathroom when I leave her in the house and leave.
Yeah_comma_ it's really annoying_comma_ hopefully she will_comma_ she is still a puppy.
I got stuck in the middle of the storm the other night.
I was walking around outside!
Yes!
Someone scammed me.
It was a guy at the bank that I have been working with for years_comma_ and he told me about an "outside the bank opportunity" that ended up just being him stealing my money!
He said that he had a house that needed to be flipped_comma_ but he couldn't afford the renovations.  He would split the money with me when it sold if I would fund the renovation.  It was supposed to be $200_comma_000 to split_comma_ but guess what?  He left town and I have no idea where he is.
Yup_comma_ I gave him $100_comma_000 up front.
I'm really happy I get to see some friends when I go back to school next week.

My family and I were finally getting to go on vacation for the first time in 5 years_comma_ but we had to cancel because we all got horribly sick.

I'm so grateful I have a working car to get around and run errands now!

It usually takes me so long to pick out a new book to read_comma_ but I really like the one I've started.

I ran a red light this morning
I was late to work so I needed to do anything I could. I felt terrible after the face because I could of caused an accident
I found a long grey hair in my sand witch this afternoon when I went out to lunch.
No_comma_ that's what makes it so gross.  Must have been a workers.
I have been with my car insurance company for 30 years.
They are alright_comma_ but I really like my agent.  We're good friends from the way back.
A friend of mine entered a pie eating contest with no prior experience and won second place! I was so surprised he was able to do so good.
It was a strawberry pie. And yeah_comma_ I think he may have a natural talent for this! I told him that he should start taking it seriously and training for it.
My radiator broke down in my car that I rely heavily on. 
I can but they said it will cost at least 2000 dollars for it to be replaced.  Might have to buy a new used car!
I just started this new book about the American Revolution. It's not something I usually read about_comma_ so I hope it's good.
So far it is. I really think it's going to be a great book.
My computer's motherboard wasn't running properly so I did a little quick fix. I'd really like it to keep running for another month or two until I can afford a new one.
I had to solder it in a few different spaces. So far so good! I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it'll run a bit longer.
I am having my first baby; a boy. I hear all these different labor stories that aren't exactly reassuring! 
Aw_comma_ that's so neat. I would love two boys!  I am having a boy!  Oh good_comma_ that's another good story for me to hold onto.  I'm not expecting it to be amazing or anything but wow_comma_ so many people say they almost died and things.

Just relax and take my mind off work.  We will be staying at an all-inclusive beach resort!
Wish I could take you a long_comma_ but can't!
Really afraid of flying next week_comma_ it's been a while since I've been on a plane!
To the bahamas for vacation_comma_ so it's not all that bad.  Just the plane ride!
My wife passed away about a year ago_comma_ now I have no family in my life.
She was in a car accident.
My sister just lost her baby at 18 weeks along. We are all grieving and I'm trying to support her in any way I can. Being a mother myself_comma_ I feel so depressed and sad for her.
It seems to be happening a lot because my best friend had a miscarriage too about a month ago.  I will definitely keep trying to be with her and bring her meals and clean.  I cannot shake the sadness either so I have to force myself to be positive around her.
My wife went on a business trip for two weeks. At first I thought it'd be awesome to have the house to myself_comma_ but I'm starting to miss her now.
Yeah_comma_ this first week was pretty productive_comma_ actually. I fixed a few things around the house and then just relaxed. But now the fun is over and my emotions are getting to me. But hey_comma_ not long left to wait!
I'm pretty bummed how my cake turned out_comma_ I had high hopes for it
I thought I followed the instructions correctly_comma_ but turned out a lot different what it was suppose to.  Oh well

My wife had a nightmare and woke me up screaming.  After that I couldnt go back to sleep and she scared me pretty good
I was really looking forward to going away this weekend with my boyfriend_comma_ but we had to cancel the trip.
Work stuff. It's just so disappointing. I was really looking forward to it. 
Someone paid off my student loans for me? I'm shocked!
Yes_comma_ it's going to help me out so much!
Almost every night_comma_ something keeps dumping over my big trash can outdoors. I keep watching for animals but the way its propped up on a board_comma_ I don't see how an animal can do it.
I was thinking of that because having to clean up the mess every time is ridiculous! I've already tried repellents but only natural ones since I don't like spraying chemicals.  I will have to price out some cameras.
My son knew that he wasn't suppose to bring drinks near my computer_comma_ and he didn't listen! Now he spilled water all over my gaming computer and it won't turn on.
I'm not so sure if it's forgetting or just wanting to be contrary_comma_ honestly! Maybe I'm just being a little negative because of how mad I am. People do make mistakes_comma_ but that computer cost me and arm and leg to build!
I was supposed to go to Busch Gardens last weekend.

I can't get my money under control and I am so angry with myself.

I was in a work meeting the other day and one of my coworkers was was able to recite from memory a whole lot of legal policy and verbiage. I was floored by how much he had retained from studying! 
I was thinking that he must have some kind of photographic memory!  I could never have remembered all that stuff!
I was with my uncle the other day and he wanted to watch a Discovery TV show I wasn't familiar with so I said okay. It was Dirty Jobs. It was so gross_comma_ you couldn't pay me enough to do those jobs!

My friend rescued from a shelter but had to giver her up. I offered to take her and I'm so glad I did.
I was rewarded well.
I was visiting my parents over the holiday. One night I decided to drive in front of our old home I grew up in. It still looked the same. It was nice to see it again.

Certified Public Accountant - he passed all 4 exams with flying colors!
A dog in our neighborhood got loose earlier while the kids were playing in the front yard. He is very aggressive and I could just imagine being at the hospital later.
I was able to rush the kids inside the house before the dog approached them. The owner was closely following behind with his leash. 
I remember this time in high school_comma_ I was really bad at Chemistry and the mid term exam determined the majority of our grade for the semester and I studied very hard. It was so hard waiting to get my score to see if it would lift my grade enough to pass the class! I hate uncertainty!
Yes! It sure does!
my brother is sick
he spent two months in the hospital and is almost a month in to his rehab

My next door neighbor is currently having a pool installed. I am so envious! I want one very badly since it is so hot here in Florida!

I hunt out with a friend over the weekend to make sure they were okay. He was having trouble with his wife

I felt bad when I saw a stray dog on the road. I almost had to stop
I do too_comma_ I hate seeing that
I was nervous going to the gym today. There were a lot of people there
That is great advice
My boss can be so bothersome at times. He will give us a bunch of work to do_comma_ but want to sit there and talk to us at length while we are trying to concentrate on our tasks!
He is totally oblivious to the fact that we are so busy.  It drives me insane!
I ran over a rabbit this morning. I felt bad

I have been having a lot of money trouble and just yesterday an anonymous cashiers check came in the mail for $5000!
I have no idea_comma_ but it came at just the right time.  I was about to get evicted and my power had already been shut off.  I think it was from someone in my church.
This might sound odd_comma_ but I am looking forward to getting back to work after my current vacation ends.

I got a friend request on facebook last week from this person that I knew I recognized but couldnt remember exactly where I had met them.

No not yet_comma_ Im still trying to recall everything and get all caught up on his life! 15 years is a long time! Lol
I just had to move out of my house_comma_ but I think it is for the best.

I bumped into my friends car this morning parking. It was a little shameful for me
It was just a slight hit so no

I am jealous of my coworker_comma_ he is very smart and athletic
I am trying_comma_ some people are just gifted
Although my life isn't going very well right now_comma_ at least I have a roof over my head and food to eat. Many people in the world don't even have those two things.

I was shocked that the Eagles won the superbowl last year_comma_ really caught me off guard
Not at all_comma_ they  were 7-9 the year prior

I live in a duplex and my neighbors keep parking their cars too far apart for me to park my one car and its a driveway for 4 cars. They really don't know how to park.
I've already spoken directly to them about it because there should be room left for even another car in case someone comes over.  They did it for about 2 days and then went back to doing it badly again.  I have to talk to the landlord next.
Last time I dressed up I felt confide t.

Oh girl...Don't you hate that? I cannot stand a lazy dude..Unless they are working 15 hour days..and even then..I work too- Everyone needs to help. Oi...When did men ever turn into boys as they get older? And not in the cute happy way! lol
Kick him out honey..You are not his mother. Partners should never have to be the parent to a grown adult. You are worth more then that and you are here working. Frankly he either needs to be taking care of the house and doing a good job OR WORKING..His job should be looking for work all day then. Oi...I am angry for you!!

I saw a lady spit all over her hands after coughing..and then sneeze_comma_ wipe her nose..then she TOUCHED the door handle

A lady in my church is going through a hard time. Now I don't have much but I want to help her out however I can.
She is so I was thinking I could collect some canned goods for her.
I bought some groceries today for someone I care about that is HARD to care about sometimes.
They make it hard because they have a lot of problems and they take their anger out on me. But they are trying really hard to change..and while it's too soon to tell..I felt very compassionate towards them today.
They have some mental illness and they had a very rough child hood..I saw a video the other day that reminded me of what their child hood was like..I can't imagine how I would be if I grew up like that
My daughter's chihuahua was diagnosed with an auto-immune disease about a month after we had her.  She did pretty good with it for quite awhile.

i cant wait for my vacation to start next week!!1
i am going to amsterdam
I am getting older and to still see that people can be so untrustworthy and that they will be such betrayers and so hateful over nothing is hard to see
That is very sad. I think there are people like this in every generation but it seems like everyone is getting more detached_comma_ more apathetic as the years go on.
I don't know if it will ever get better honestly. Hold on to the good people
i loved taking care of my sisters pet

It's amazing how much the dog I have has recovered from abuse and almost being starved to death in just two weeks!
Me too! Except now she drives me a bit crazy as poor girl seems to not know anything about house living and I don't think she ever experienced puppy hood- she is a year old. So now she is being a handful! 
i am happy its almost the weekend!
clubbin
A guy pulled out turning left right in front of us_comma_ he didn't even STOP in the turn lane and he made a semi circle to also pass the left lane and come ALL the way over to the right lane and cut us off. 
Yep...because he was a foot from us it was hard to stop and we were wedged in! We had to SLAM on the brakes. I truly hate bad drivers

My daughter just got her drivers permit a few months ago.

So my friend is keen to watch a horror film this weekend at the cinema_comma_ but I always get freaked out by them.

That's probably a good idea. I keep forgetting though.
I celebrated my birthday last week. My parents had been working behind my back with my best friend in order to set up a trip to Miami for the two of us!
It really was a total shock. I hadn't been expecting that at all!

That's very true. Thank you.
I had mentioned to my husband that I was really interested in a Cane Corso puppy since our dogs are getting a bit older now. I really never thought he'd agree_comma_ but we had a discussion and decided we should start looking into getting a black male pup!

I just ate a whole pack of cookies

I was at the mall and smelled a cologne that my ex used to wear. It brought back old memories
Mostly good_comma_ i felt so nostalgic in that moment that I cried!

I am finding it hard to let go of my grandfathers old Mercedes.

My son came first in the swimming gala at his college!
I really am! He worked so hard and it finally paid off. 
After graduating college I was having so much trouble finding a job. A friend of my dad's decided to give me a chance at his business. I was so thankful for the opportunity from him!
He says I'm one of his best employees. I'm hoping he gives me a raise soon though because it's gotten pretty stagnant.
Sunday will be so fun_comma_ I can't wait! We're going on a roadtrip
We're driving down to the beach_comma_ it's been a whil
I have a friend who's really great looking. He always attracts girls no matter where he goes or how he's dressed. I wish I could have that affect on people.

I got a new laptop pretty recently. Blown away by the performance difference from my old one
Yeah it really has! Didn't know what I was missing.
I spilled tea over myself at dinner with my in-laws and just wanted the earth to swallow me in that moment.

He was sitting on a perch looking hungry. He asked for money but I didnt have any so I gave his a slice of pizza and he cursed me out.
His teeth were missing so maybe he couldnt eat the pzza

Last week_comma_ my car glass was broken by someone
No. There was nothing to steal. Now_comma_ I need to pay to fix it. I am already having some financial issues.
I'm expecting a friend who I haven't seen in years to come over tomorrow. I'm a bit nervous about seeing him as I'm not really sure how much may have changed since the last time I saw him.
Yeah I think so. I usually get nervous before social situations so I guess I'm used to feeling this way anyway.
I was so terrified last night! I heard a noise outside my bedroom that sounded like someone was tapping on the window!
I did! I nervously peeked outside and found out it was just a bird that was jumping on a tree branch_comma_ which made it hit the window! I thought for sure I'd see a person when I looked out!

I found a spider in my bathroom.... ive never ran so fast in my life!

I took a licensing exam for the state. I thought it was going to be so easy so I didn't study at all. I ended up failing the test and feeling very frustrated at myself because of my lack of efforts.
Yes but I have to wait a year. In the meantime I can't keep working.
My son lied to me and it really hurt as a parent we just always want the truth. 
Yeah it was and I dont appreciate it at all. I just cant believe he would lie about something to me. 
I had to give a presnetation at work a few days ago. I forgot my slides so I had to give it with no materials. That was a super awkward experience.
Well I was quite flustered. But I think I did fairly well in the end.
My birthday was yesterday. Everybody seems to have forgotten about it though. I didn't get a single happy birthday from anyone family or friends. I thought it was really depressing.
I guess that was an option. I just figured they'd remember at some point.
I had a habit of playing video games. Now my daughter is playing the same game in updated version.

Yesterday I caught up talking with my cousin... it brought back so many good memories
Yes I did until  she moved to the west coast
I saw an ad for Disneyland the other day
I think they run an ad every year as it was a 'summer' themed ad about all the summer attractions. I really want to go as I've only been once when I was a kid!
my car is a little newer_comma_ it does not keep breaking down anymore like the older one
no i donated it_comma_ it was not even worth selling 
My sister finally graduated college and I'm so happy for her!
I am! She switched majors several times so it's been a long journey. She's finally figured it out though
A man approached me after I got out of my car in a shopping center parking lot.
It was very unsettling. He told me to give him a dollar.
I felt I had no choice but to give him the dollar. He looked mean and said he used to rob banks.
I awoke to someone banging on my door in the middle of the night. By the time I got to the door I couldnt see anyone out there. I was so scared.
No but if it happens again I will. I ordered a camera for my porch. I couldnt get any sleep that night.
My friend randomly brought me a cake to thank me for watching her dogs while she was away
It was quite unexpected_comma_ but I appreciated it!

Last year_comma_ when  my kids were both at school_comma_ I would get lonely at home sometimes.
Most of the time I'm happy and content but occasionally I get lonely.
It's weird how they can drive you crazy when they are with you but you miss them the minute they are gone!
They finally go back to school next week and I'm looking forward to it but I know I'll get lonely at times.
I applied for a job recently. It was a federal job that took me months to apply and train for. After I gave my 2 week notice to my current employer_comma_ the federal organization pulled their job offer.

Was playing rough with my relatives_comma_ running around outside_comma_ doing touch football. I think I twisted my ankle or something. I'm dumb and don't have health insurance this year.. Worried how much money I'm gonna have to spend
Yeah_comma_ who knows. It's still hurting like crazy. Just a nice reminder of how dumb I was in not being on top of renewing my health insurance
This printer is driving me crazy!
They're about as useless as my printer. This stupid thing never acts right.
I'm really excited for dove season that starts next month
The dove hunting part.
Its fun as far as birt hunting goes.  They're small and fly very fast_comma_ as compared to most other birds. 
Can't believe I broke her vase.
My mothers_comma_ I was playing with my beyblade and it shot off and smashed it.
She did thankfully but i was quite ashamed at the time.
I'm jealous of my brother's new job. He's going to be making 6 figures!
He's a full-stack web developer_comma_ he got a job at a big company!
I'm so looking forward to college football season_comma_ Saturdays are going to be awesome!
Oklahoma Sooners!  But I enjoy just veging out and watching games all Saturday!
I just took visited my friend in the hospital that had a baby. I love being around new borns. 
It is_comma_ those quiet snuggle naps. Makes me miss my kiddo being little. 
I only have one. She is 7.
I'm so grateful to have awesome neighbors_comma_ they look after my house when I'm on vacation!
Yep_comma_ and I trust them a lot so no worries at all!
I made in A in all of my classes last semester. I have never done that before. I am really happy with myself. 
You bet. I will continue to work hard. The payoff is well worth it.
My kids were sweet when they wre babies
They are bundles of never ending energy now lol
When I was a kid_comma_ I would bake a cake for my dad's birthday and take it to his job at the fire station.
That's a good tip! His birthday is coming up and I'm going to reinstate the tradition. He's retired now_comma_ but spends Tuesday's playing dominos with his buddies. I'm gong to surprise him then.
Aww that's so sweet. Yea_comma_ he'll be very happy.
Smacked a fly on my desk earlier. Was really happy that I finally killed it.. noticed it was really big.. looked closer to see why.. and it had lil babies crawling out of it onto my desk! Didn't feel like eating lunch after that
I let it make me much more annoyed than it should have.. to the point where I was snapping at other people unnecessarily just because of how mad it was making me. But yeah_comma_ not gonna lie_comma_ felt a little satisfied too that I prevented it from creating more little nuissances
I won first place in a chili cooking competition at work today.
A $50  gift card and bragging rights.
About 15.
I'll probably give it a try. They do little events like this a few times a year.
I could've believe my eyes seeing my mom walk down the isle and getting her degree.
She ended up getting an arts degree!
She has just recently got in to painting_comma_ would you like to see it?
I was going to invite you to see her work sometime!
I bought groceries to make the kids' school lunches
Sandwiches and fruit usually. I have to go back to the store though
They ate almost every thing and school hasnt even started yet.
So_comma_ my mom thinks she's sooo funny every christmas because she always wraps up one of the gifts in a poptart box (or something similar). The big surprise this year was I opened my present up and it really was just poptarts this time.
She's always recording every christmas. You know what the kicker was though_comma_ was that it was the poptarts with no frosting/icing on top.
I walked up on a snake in my backyard a few days ago.
Yeah_comma_ it startled me at first. Then I got a hoe and killed it.
I just got back from a job interview. It went really well. I feel I might get an offer.
It was for a Financial Analyst job. I really want the job.
Can't believe I just saw all my possessions disappear.
The whole place burned down in the middle of the night
Me too we're going to call them today_comma_ we lost a dog as well.
I found my deceased grandfathers watch in an old box in my parents attic. It is actually quite valuable_comma_ but I don't think I could bring myself to sell it. It has way too much meaning to myself and my family.
I agree.  No amount of money could replace it.  I will end up giving to my kids for sure.
I have a 7 year old daughter that asked to play piano. I found a piano teacher and she is very intense. I thought she would scare my 7 year old but she has excelled in just 7 months of playing. Maybe the teacher is not all that bad.
That is exactly what I thought_comma_ but recently she has started to push her a little bit harder and wanting to her to compose music because my daughter has a great ear for music.
Yes she has a gift. However_comma_ she is also good at ballet_comma_ karate_comma_ and science. What is a mother to do?
I am so excited for the fall
Two fabolous weedings of my two fabulous friends
I will. I love getting dressed up and celebrating
A fly landed in my cup of coffee this morning.
Dumped my coffee out and drove to work  without my morning coffee.  I didn't have time to make another cup.
5
My sister just passed away.
We were_comma_ it's so tragic. Cancer spares no one.
It really is difficult_comma_ I've started therapy recently.
I hope so too it's a difficult time for sure.
I was so upset when my daughter left with my earbuds
she isnt very good at bringing things back
hopefully
I finished last semester with a 3.5 GPA. I cant believe I did that well. All that hard work paid off.
My major is Finance. I will shoot for a 4.0 this semester. 
I got to see my favorite guitarist last night_comma_ he was amazing.
I play a little bit but I could never be as good as Anthony Green.
It was amazing_comma_ he played my favorite song too.
I recently moved from Alabam aall the way to Indiana. I like it a lot better_comma_ but I hate having to leave my family behind. I miss them.
Thanks for that! I've been feeling pretty blue_comma_ so I appreciate it.
I feel really good about this job interview I have coming up.
Its an accounting job. I feel well qualified.
It makes me happy to see my cat waiting for me at the front door when I come home after a long day of work
Yea_comma_ she's a sweetheart. First cat I've ever owned and I realize now that I'm a cat person as opposed to a dog person.
I don't order chicken anymore from restaurants
I got sick the ;ast time and i am too scared
I think so but I am just too scared now
When I'm driving around and I see a stray dog or cat_comma_ I feel so bad that I can't help but stop to pick them up and bring them home! I can't believe how many people neglect their pets!
Oh_comma_ man_comma_ I have a LOT! I have a pretty big fenced in back yard. I'd say around 20. I need to stop soon_comma_ but I can't help it!
Thanks_comma_ I appreciate that. I hope others get inspired to do something similar when they hear my story.
So my dog passed away a couple of weeks ago. Its been really hard not having him around.
I had him for 12 years. 
I found a hair in my sandwhich at lunch.
From jasons deli :(
Yeah_comma_ Pretty gross. Not the way to end lunch on a friday.
It was catered lunch. So on refunds. 
Don't you hate it when you're feeling confident in a new hairstyle or some clothes you're wearing_comma_ and then someone makes fun of you? Had that happen the other day. Makes you want to be able to hide in the background and never try anything new again
It was actually a stranger_comma_ and I was on public transportation. They didn't actually say anything to me_comma_ I could just tell the way they were giving me a look_comma_ and kind of shaking their head and then laughing to themselves_comma_ that it was pointed at me. Maybe I read too much into it. Either way_comma_ made me want to sink into the ground
I think it was my haircut :( But thank you for the kind words. I need you to hype me up in the morning and make me feel confident!
Yes_comma_ it seemed to bug out_comma_ not sure
I was so sad when my cat passed away.
It was the worst_comma_ I didn't get to say goodbye she got hit by a car.
It was so difficult_comma_ I don't even know if the person cares that they took away my favorite pet.
I was at work the other day_comma_ just sitting at my desk.
I felt really calm because I was working with numbers.
I had a particularly meaningful Thanksgiving gathering with my family.
Each of us took turns saying how thankful we were about certain things in our lives. 
Yes_comma_ everything from scratch_comma_ even the pie crusts.
We make cherry and apple and my grandson makes pumpkin. How about you?
i never really had thought to do this_comma_ but the other day I just grilled spur of the moment and watched the sun set with my sister. It was really nice_comma_ honestly.
We grilled a couple of hotdogs and hamburgers_comma_ and we're roommates basically. It works good because I'm so used to living with her that it's a lot better than an average roommate.
My friend is coming in from out of town today.
Thanks_comma_ we're gonna have a blast this weekend.
my daughter has matured so well
14. she can babysit her younger siblings now. im proud of her
Get to hang out and play cards with my girlfriend and her parents. Her parents are actually pretty laid back and fun to be around_comma_ so I'm looking forward to it. Glad I don't have to deal with overbearing in-laws like some people
Heck yeah I was. I think everybody is. But then once you get over the annoying stage of saying all the general stuff about yourself_comma_ and meeting them for the first few times_comma_ it got pretty easy
I feel bad
In the past couple of months I have barely cooked. We have eaten a lot a fast food. 
I need to do that
I am bummed out today. I failed a big test and my co-worker passed.
A little.. I mean it was an English test.. I know English. LOL
Have had this roommate for a year. Decided to renew lease with him. Been pretty good so far.. except he has a problem remembering to flush the toilet--no matter whether it's #1 or #2. Getting kind of old.
Yeah I guess.. I mean it's much more annoying to me to have to do another roommate search. Searching for roommates and apartments in general is just so annoying_comma_ and I'd rather spend the time trying to make money for rent and all that. But yeah_comma_ not sure why some people have these kind of quirks.
I received this email yesterday saying that I have unclaimed money and all I have to do is verify some information to receive it. I confirmed the validity of the email and it turns out to be a substantial amount of money.
I am totally laughing out loud at your response! I thought the same thing when i first got the notice_comma_ however I have spoken with a representative and it an actually gift from a deceased family member.
I'm impressed with my new used car that I bought for cheap. It runs great.
Yeah I am_comma_ I only got it for 2000 dollars as well!
my daughter gets to pick the movie tonight for movie night
i know i won't. She has been saying all week she is picking a horror film
I am going to take a pill and go to sleep lol
I had to fend off this girl at a party.
She tried to kiss me when I already have a girlfriend.
I was I felt so faithful in the moment my girl was proud oto.
I came home from work.. and opened my mail up.. and you won't believe what I got in the mail.
I got a repo notice for my car.  I am so upset.
Yes.. but I had a valid reason.  Cries..
I couldn't work I was taking care of my sick husband.
I can't wait til I get to try my new Jet-Skis out on the lake. They will be fun.
Not this weekend_comma_ but we have plans for the weekend after that!
Nope_comma_ it should be an interesting and fun experience!
Do you own a pet? I feel very motherly toward my cat lol
Isn't it nice to come home to them after a long day of work?
I'm getting anxious about visiting my girlfriend's parents this weekend_comma_ it'll be our first time meeting.
We have only been dating a month.
I was so scared.  I was at a graveyard in the dark with my drunk boyfriend.
I thought it would be entertaining.  But I sorta lost him for a bit because it was so dark.  LOL.  I just stayed near the road/car and waited till I saw him again.
I was shocked. I was at the state park walking through the woods and I swear I saw a Bigfoot.
Just like you think it would.. big_comma_ tall_comma_ hairy walking ape sorta thing
My younger sister graduates from college this year_comma_ I can't believe she's going to get her degree.
It was 30s for me!  She kept at her classes_comma_ even though she had two kids pretty young and worked.
I'm so happy I have my dogs in my life_comma_ they are so loyal and happy.
Yeah_comma_ after awhile you start to love them no matter how annoying they can become sometimes.
I've been having to pee a lot lately. I know that's one of the symptoms of diabetes_comma_ and my dad has diabetes_comma_ too. Kind of worried to go to the doctor and get checked out.
I feel like it's been for no reason_comma_ but I might be paranoid. Everything has been the same so far. I just figured I'd go get a check-up anyway_comma_ since it's been a while. 
I forgot to put gas in my car and I ran out of gas on the side of the road!
Yeah_comma_ I was so ashamed! I had to call my dad to get him to bring me gas.  Felt bad.
My daughter and I just got home from her high school freshman orientation.
She got her schedule_comma_ locker and was able to figure out where her classes were.  I think we are both ready for school to start now.
My grandma passed away earlier this year. We used to always get together as a family and play cards on sundays. This sunday is the first time we're doing it again without her. It will feel weird_comma_ but nice to be with family again
Yeah_comma_ you're right. And we figured the same. We just didn't do it for a little while because it felt weird at first_comma_ and then it was easier to not be doing it once we got out of the habit. Glad we didn't let it go too long though.
My children ask me so many questions every day
The most question are asked when I'm talking to someone else. does that happen to you too/
That's all true
I need to buy a new phone soon_comma_ I've been having this one for so long. But I'm having a hard time letting go_comma_ I'm sort of attached to it.
There is_comma_ but it's more of an attachment to this specific phone itself. I've had it for so long. It feels like an old friend!
I am so mad. Someone took my crystal ball.
No.. in fact... I can't even try to get it back now because the energy in it is now ruined.
Summer is almost over_comma_ school is starting again soon.
My daughter will be a freshman in high school.  I am so stoked about it!!!
I was surprised that I was able to get into the apartment I wanted without any problems.
Right? I'm in the same situation and was expecting this place to be filled up since it's right next to the campus!
So... Last night I saw a huge black spider in my room. Took me like 20 minutes to muster up the courage to attack it. Well... I tried attacking it_comma_ and missed_comma_ and it went behind a piece of furniture and I couldn't find it again. I slept in another room..
Yeah no joke. I want to just burn the place down and move on. I bet the spider would still be alive in the ashes somewhere though_comma_ just laughing at me_comma_ like_comma_ "Thanks for the free land_comma_ chump."
I'm jealous of anyone who doesn't have to deal with student loan debt!
I'm at 350_comma_ It's horrible!
I was totally disappointed today. No one remembered my birthday.
Thank you!  Its ok I guess because I am old anyways.
My husband went away on a week long business trip_comma_ and took our dog with him
Yeah_comma_ we're both kind of crazy about the dog lol_comma_ and I hate being alone in the house
I'm in school right now and unable to pay for much since most of my money goes towards bills and that's it. My girlfriend is out of school and working_comma_ and so when we do go out_comma_ she has to pay a lot of the time. I feel bad for making her do that_comma_ but I don't have much of a choice
Yeah_comma_ I know_comma_ I just hate people paying for me_comma_ or feeling like a burden. That's like my #1 thing. But it's weird to say "no_comma_ we can't go do this fun thing just because of me_comma_ even though you want to." So it's a rock and a hard place. I guess I will just have to look forward to when I can return the favor
My favorite neighborhood restaurant is closing
Its called lucy's. it's near my house. I have had so many good memories there
Its a soulf food restaurant. Its been around since I was a kids
Can't believe my professor marked all this wrong.
All the answers on my calculus test_comma_ I know the answers were correct so I'm confused.
I haven't been able too_comma_ he's been sick lately.
I hope so_comma_ but it's stressing me out big time.
I decided to take the risk and start my own gym downtown. I think it'll do well_comma_ though! I know a lot of power lifters and bodybuilders.
Thanks! I can't wait to see it filled with people who are passionate about the iron! I'll probably take on a little personal training while I'm at it.
I feel a bit sad about this weekend. I have to work on a big project for work instead of visiting my family.
Thanks_comma_ yeah it's important to find the time to spend with those you love. I just couldn't make it this time.
I'm really impressed with our city's new freeway_comma_ it makes getting to work so easy!
It's free! That's also a huge plus_comma_ but yeah I save 10 minutes getting to work!
I am excited. School starts Monday and I am working in an alternative school. That makes it more exciting.
I hope so.  I've had a week of training on how to control delinquent youth.
Yes it is.. thanks I will need it.  At least they have a metal detector.

Yes it is!
Soo the other day I was driving_comma_ got cut off_comma_ and when I honked at the other driver to let him know he almost hit my car_comma_ he flicked me off. I'm still bitter about it.
Lol I should've done that. Anything to show my extreme displeasure. I live in a big city so bad drivers are everywhere.
I glad I can afford the necessities and a little of what I want
Me too. I am very grateful. Some people are less fortunate
I surely will. I do it now when I can
I can't believe he won't let me play baseball anymore.
My stepdad won't let me play baseball anymore simply because I hurt my arm throwing.
I think so too maybe I could play some hockey instead.
I feel really bad. I cheated on my husband.
I met a guy who lived down the beach... My husband knew about it.
I've got all my fishing gear packed up. I'm ready for tomorrow morning.
We're going to be fishing near black duck bay.
The weather is supposed to be ideal. We should do good.
I'll try.
This lady at my work is so sweet_comma_ and no one there seems to like her. I feel so bad for her.
I am.  I can tell she's lonely.  She told me her husband died awhile back so I think she's lonely too.
My husband was in an accident a couple of years ago. A van pulled out in front of him. A woman we knew was in it and she passed away.
It was so sad. She was such a sweet lady. My husband had some minor injuries_comma_ but is better now. The emotional pain was the worst thing.
So happy to have got my exam back and passed the class.
It was calculus_comma_ just an intro class but I'm not so great at math.
It was tough_comma_ just passed with a 51% thankfully.
My car was backed into at the store last week.  I found out yesterday that the person who hit me does not have insurance!
I'm more upset at the fact that they lied about having insurance!
Just found some of my long lost CD's.
I burned these old ones_comma_ had my favorite pop punk songs ont hem.

The weekend is finally here_comma_ woohoo!

Okay so I've never been a good cook but the first time I ever made a casserole was a diasaster. I went to pull it out of the oven and part of my oven mitt must have not been insolated well_comma_ so I dropped it and it shattered the door to my stove.
Oh don't worry_comma_ the casserole didn't spill_comma_ but nobody besides me wanted to eat it because they were sure there must be glass somewhere in it_comma_ ha.
I had a tire low on air but_comma_ a co-worker of mine had an air compressor in his car he let me use

I'll have to go do some shopping.
My daughter is going to be a senior in high school this year. I am so excited for her. I think I'm prepared to deal with this.
I think she is. We still haven't decided where she will go yet. She is an honor student_comma_ so she should do well wherever she goes.
My daughter finished her degree and got a job in her field right away. 
No it's pretty rare. She's in Digital journalism_comma_ and she's working as a social media manager. It's a good gig.

I ordered something online and unbeliveably it was here the next day. I wasn't expecting that!

I live at home alone with my cat_comma_ but she had to move out for a week when we were doing some construction.

I slept through it all when I could_comma_ or went to visit my little brat.
My dog passed away a few weeks ago. She was 12. I really miss her.
Thanks_comma_ and to you too. They really are our best friends.

I really like Thanksgiving. It's the only time of the year I'll make a pumpkin-sweet potato pie_comma_ and it's just a really comfy holiday. How about you?

My favorite watch broke today. :(
it broke on its own accord. no clue.
Its a tag heuer.  I'm gonna get it fixed.
It was my grandfather's watch. I don't think you have enough money to cover its sentimental value.
So excited to get my marks back from chemistry.

Riding bikes all over the county.
I've got an employee review at work on monday.

Kinda.  I'm excited to see who takes the class and help them learn to decorate cakes_comma_ but teaching the class is the easy part.
I am going horseback riding for the first time this weekend.  I am really nervous for some reason!
I am going with a couple friends who have also never rode before.  I don't think we knew what we were getting ourselves into.

I was looking through my Grandma's old recipes the other day.
Yes.  As a child we always called them "date balls"_comma_ but I recently discovered they're actually called "Skillet Cookies".

It is_comma_ I don't know what to do anymore_comma_ any ideas?
I'm gonna do that_comma_ thank you for the advice. I could try to kiss someone else to make her mad.
I'm proud of my wife and children for always being there for me.
10 and 13
My headphones have replacable wires_comma_ so I bought a replacement cord for them. It arrived and I didn't realize but it is EXTREMELY short. Wish I hadn't wasted my money.
I think I can_comma_ but I kind of felt like it was my own fault for not being more attentive.
My therapist was so kind to me_comma_ I had to tell her a lot.
It really does_comma_ I was so grateful about it. She is very helpful.
You know I really don't trust many people due to a traumatic event from my past. But when EP came along he made me believe in humanity again
EP are the initials for my husband. He is an amazing man and he shows character that I wish all mankind could have.
Thank you so much! Because of him I give people the chance they deserve now.
I'll be getting a promotion in Feb.
Yes_comma_ and I'll get a pretty good raise.
I'm excited for the plums on my plum tree to ripen
They are_comma_ they are usually very sweet
I came home today after a long day at work in a pretty foul mood.
I was passed over again for a promotion. They gave it to someone who has been there less than a year.
Me and my girlfriend broke up yesterday.
Doing ok i guess.  Probably better its over now rather than later.
My 15 year old dog just died.  He was my buddy and I am all broken up because of his passing.
Yeah_comma_ I understand it was his time to go_comma_ but it doesn't make it any easier.
I baked recently and I was happy to find that my cheesecake was fluffy like the Japanese kind
Yes! The top kind of fell a bit flatter after_comma_ but it looked kinda like a souffle
I was watching TV and was just thinking about how much I wish friends was still on the air. I miss that show. 
I know that_comma_ but I would like some new episodes...
My sister got a new pair of shoes. They were the same ones that I had been wanting but can't afford. I should have been happy for her but I wasn't.
Probably but I can't right now. I know how I feel isn't right but I can't help it.
I had a good day at work_comma_ now i'm kicking back and watching TV for the rest of the day.
I need to  catch up on the expanse.
My baby napped for three hours today_comma_ which is NOT usual.
Nope_comma_ I think he was just tuckered out!  I managed to get a lot of housework done_comma_ so it was nice.
I hope my real estate lady comes by Monday. She said she was busy and to call her Monday morning
I hope so. I need to sell my house fast. I have super evil neighbors.
actually the exact opposite. These people are trying to set me up  for revenge and one is a cop
I read what you said wrong. Sorry_comma_ They would be afraid of a man_comma_ I'm a woman_comma_ single and a target
I am so mad at my co-worker today! She had the nerve to tell our boss that I was rude to a patient_comma_ which is completely out of my character
Especially a co-worker like her. She is not nice to patients or people and she just wants to get me in trouble because she is always in hot water.
Thank you so much! I will take that advice and be calm and cool tomorrow.
I have an amazing brother. He's so great to talk to. I can tell him anything!
He's in high school_comma_ but he is very mature for his age. 
i got my sister a line on my cell phone line
she was_comma_ but I am not. I think she has paid on time maybe twice in two years
It drives me more than crazy! I wouldnt do that to anyone
exactly
I got my new vacuum finally! It works great and has great suction power. 
No_comma_ I got it on a warehouse deal. The first one didn't work so I have had to wait all week to get this one. I get a newer version anyhow so it worked out better
I had to go to the top of a building for a work meeting. I'm scared of heights so it made me very very nervous.
Yeah people are always telling me to confront my fear but I think they are crazy.
A manager from another team is trying to undermine my work.
Yes but I want to make trouble. He is trying his best but he didn't succeed.
I don't want to make trouble (sorry)
Someone screwed up a work task that I was partnered with.
He also wasted 30 minutes of my time and his own and did it out of spite. I think so! Some people just like to be miserable and blame others
I cannot wait until I pay off my car
I know. I will have a bit more free income
Hopefully. 
My aunt died and it was really upsetting. She was my favorite aunt too
Thanks_comma_ she is in a better place though. 
My dad gave me an old coin that used to belong to his grandfather_comma_ who died when I was young.
It's pretty old and worn.  I don't think it's worth much $$$ but it was meaningful anyway
I keep it in my jewelry box with my few other precious objects lol
I had a few friends over for drinks the other night
It was nice until everyone left and Some money was missing from my bedroom.
I didn't and I only had friends over. Thats the really bad part
My manager have me new challenges to achieve. I am sure that I will succeed.
I am happy with that. It will help me grow in the organisation.
I am worried about attending my firearms class. I think I will fail the test.
I haven't practiced enough.
I got my new vacuum today finally! I couldn't wait to open it up! The last one was broken...
Only like $65. This is the first new vacuum I have ever gotten! I have always had super old ones
I already DID! lol- As soon as it arrived. Great suction. I can finally clean up around my bunny cage and it even gets dust off the wall!
I am looking forward to this weekend in some ways. I am hoping that GOOD positive things will happen.
Well nothing in particular_comma_ I am just hoping good things will happen versus anything bad! lol I don't feel so great so it would be nice if this weekend had good things in it :)
Well not always but it's better then being sad
I am appreciative of my girlfriend_comma_ she is very supportive and sweet!
She just helps keep me level and less stressed when I would be a wreck otherwise
I am really excited for the new super smash bros coming out_comma_ that will be such a fun game!
It is worth getting into_comma_ they can be very relaxing
i can't stand going to the bathroom at work after someone else.
some people are just so nasty.
i already have to smell them. i'm not going to clean up after them.
I feel bad that I didn't finish painting my mom's house.
I got tired_comma_ I am sorta lazy.
My daughter has been lying to me for a year
She misplaced my tablet somewhere and swears it just vanished
I can't prove anything. I know it didn't disappear though. That's impossible
My landlord is boring everyone in the building. He is here every day asking questions.
He is afraid that some person run away without paying the rent. He is afraid that people use too much the heating system
I had wanted to wear a pair of earrings that my grandmother gave me to her funeral.
I couldn't find them. Id had them for so long I couldnt remember where they were
me too
I had someone at work ruined our project and wasted my time it made me incredibly angry.
Sorry *ruin. They simply decided they would not do the project according to instructions and just wanted to give me a hard time and ruin the time we had to work on it.
I hope so. I reported them but who knows? You know how some bosses don't care :/
A coworker is stealing money at work. He threatened me if I said anything about it.
I am too scared to do anything.
I am excited for the football season_comma_ I hope the Eagles can repeat!
They won the superbowl!
I was heartbroken when my grandma passed away_comma_ I was not equipped to handle that
From cancer_comma_ it is very common in my area
I cannot wait for the new super smash bros game_comma_ it looks amazing!

The went over to my sister before I saw it. 
i got a yoga mat for free at work today. i'm thinking about trying it out
this would be my first time
i am up for the challenge i think.
Someone used some racial slurs today and it really made me angry. I freeze with anger when that happens
I know right? I swear..my blood boils at ANY kind of injustice or cruelty.
So true! Especially since you know who got in office...A big bully!
I was heartbroken when my grandma passed away_comma_ I was not equipped to handle that
I guess nobody does_comma_ but that is how it goes unfortunately
I'm happy I can afford to take care of my health. If i need something special or specific_comma_ I can just buy it usually. 
It is! I am enjoying it. Things don't always last_comma_ so you have to enjoy any good things when they happen.  I have almost never had a time like that in my life where I can even buy necessary items.
Me too! lol. Thank you
Before I met my girlfriend and friends_comma_ I felt very alone_comma_ it was a dark time
I think so_comma_ I owuld like a better job but that is it
Three is a good number of kids for me
Three. I think I am done lol
I used to think I wanted more_comma_ but nah. Im good
My landlord entered my appartment without notifying me. I was sleeping.
I was mad. I woke up and saw him in my room. Then there was an argument.
I hate scary movies_comma_ they scare me so much_comma_ especially jumpscares
I still dislike them_comma_ I do not know why they still scare me
Before I met my girlfriend and friends_comma_ I felt very alone_comma_ it was a dark time
I was just not a liked person I guess_comma_ I was very shy
I used to have to walk hours to my grandmothers after school.
MY mom had moved across town. She would drop me off at school and I would have to walk there after. 
Especially not a 16 year old girl
I am happy with my life now_comma_ I have a good girlfriend and friend group
I am_comma_ it is nice to feel like this for a change
I was heartbroken when my grandma passed away_comma_ I was not equipped to handle that
It is okay_comma_ it was a few years ago_comma_ but it still stings a bit
i am hoping to win the lottery!
yea thats true
I am happy with my life now_comma_ I have a good girlfriend and friend group
Yeah pretty often_comma_ pretty much every other day
I bought a movie on demand last night and my kids watched like 5 minutes and left
ilse of Dogs. I am going to make them watch it tonight. I don't waste money lol
I will let you know later lol
My roommate was stealing money from my closet in my room.
I asked him to pay back the money that he stole or I go to the police to show them the video.
He had no choice. He decided to pay me back.
I hate scary movies_comma_ they scare me so much_comma_ especially jumpscares
I get that_comma_ the noises are just so loud your body cannot react to it well
I don't think my new neighbors are nice people
They were really lous and cursing all night and their toddlers were playing inthe street. Im kind of scared of them
Theyve only been there two days and it seems like they have partied both nights. I dont like it
i didnt expect to get the day off today
yes!
I got a statistics tutor over the summer
I think I cought on pretty well. I going to do well this semester.
Thanks
Super sad today. It's the weekend pretty much and I have a hard time with loneliness on the weekends especially.
That is hard as there is not the typical work which keeps me busy on the weekdays.
Look for work_comma_ work on business and try not to let it get to me.
I workout daily. I try to keep busy but the loneliness eats at me right now. I just had to kick my partner out to go get help..I miss him..but I don't miss the bad parts..but it's still hard to be alone and do everything alone_comma_ you know? I am not at a music place yet. I am healing as well. Healing is NOT easy
One time I went out to eat with my friend. And there was a customer who was just very rude and vulgar. My friend and i gave each other "the look" and realized we were having the same thoughts. I was surprised. 
(im glad to hear you have someone. But having someone who cant be biased always helps too) It really is. Some people can get so nasty and vicious over the smallest things! Im so glad i got out of the food industry. 
Yes! Specially when its something wrong with the food. Like they didn't make the food? the cook did. They get the heat for EVERYTHING. 
Waiting for pizza to come. I ordered extra of everything.
Olives! And all the vegetables.
We were going to the lake for a weekend getaway since we haven't had some downtime in forever and then we got sick instead.
We don't have another weekend to do it so unfortunately_comma_ no.  I think we will just wait for chilly weather and try to do something else.
I was heartbroken when my grandma passed away_comma_ I was not equipped to handle that
Not well_comma_ but it was years ago now_comma_ so you learn to adapt
i was scared when i walked home last night
dark wooded area
A couple of weeks ago I woke up to the LOUDEST banging on my apartment door. It was like 3AM in the morning.
Well_comma_ I thought about opening it but I didn't. I don't know exactly what happened_comma_ but the police came and I heard them telling the man to go home_comma_ so maybe he was on something.
My new semester is starting up next week and I am crossing my fingers it will be a good one.
I'll be taking a lot of marketing and budgeting classes this time_comma_ so I am trying to get my brain ready for math lol.
I am hoping the Eagles can win it all again this season!
They are the hometown team_comma_ been a big fan since I was 8
I had a argument with my manager. I think that I will be let go soon_comma_
We couldn't agree on how to conduct the project. It is not the first time. I need to start looking for another job before it is too late.
 I hate scary movies_comma_ they scare me so much_comma_ especially jumpscares
I like action movies and comedies mostly
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                My kids were so lazy this summer
no. They just wwanted to sleep all day. Even when we took trips. 
School starts Monday. I am gonna have a better schedule next summer
I had my wallet stolen today.
Downtown_comma_ but the worst part is it was the only thing I got from my grandfather before he passed last year.  I am really upset.
 I hate scary movies_comma_ they scare me so much_comma_ especially jumpscares
I cannot stand them_comma_ they are no fun
Two more days and the kids are outta here!
Mostly happy. They have annoyed me greatly all summer
Thanks. I wish this feeling of relief for everyone
I am so ready for the upcoming school year
I finnaly picked a major and I got some really good classes
I think its better when you are doing something you like so I think Im gonna love it
i was ready to eat at that buffet we went to last night
i love eating everything i sea too
My job got me the best present the other day when they celebrated my birthday.
It was a flat image of Darth Vader_comma_ where he was drawn with lights that change color. 
I know_comma_ I really enjoyed it!
The other day I was at a restaurant and when I got my food it had a hair in it! I was so looking forward to eating it and WHAM! A big 'ol hair!!!
NO! I sent it back and ordered something else! 
i knew i shouldnt have trusted my brother with my dog
my dog ran away!
I just got a bonus at work that I wasn't expecting!
It was $180!  I got it for making the most sales of the quarter for my company!
 I hate scary movies_comma_ they scare me so much_comma_ especially jumpscares
I like action and comedies mostly_comma_ some dramas
One of my favorite things to do is cook_comma_ and I recently moved into a new apartment by myself. I'm gonna say cooking for yourself isn't really as fun as cooking for a group.
It is! It's sort of like how if someone packs you a little note with your lunch_comma_ it's really nice_comma_ but obviously if you made your own note you'd just feel silly.
My friend got us concert tickets to a sold out show. He told me he couldn't get them. I cant believe he kept that a secret until now.
It is to see Phoenix_comma_ my favorite band. I was shocked that he had the tickets. I cant wait to go now.
I am going to the doctor monday. I hope everything is okay
I have just been feeling really tired lately. Low energy and the vitamins arent helping
Me too. I hate being sick and taking any thing other than vitamins
a guy pulled out in front of me_comma_ almost caused a dang wreck
shoot me too_comma_ then he decides to drive so slow
I went to a restaurant yesterday for dinner and it was pretty good.
I did_comma_ it is one of my favorites.  The great part was that I ended up getting the meal for free because of their rewards program.  I didn't even know I had any points.
I am moving to new appartment. The new neighborhood is so nice. I am so happy that I found this appartment. 
Yes_comma_ I wanted a swimming pool and a gym in the building.
i was sad when  i didnt get the day off
cause we had too much work
I have a routine that gets me really excited and ready for work in the morning. I'm always so productive at work because of it!
Yeah having a good routine is a good way to put you in the right mood to work. 
Yesterday I wore a bathing suit and felt more confident then I have in a long time.
I have recently started working out and have lost a few inches and things are firmer.
That's the best part of it! but being healthy isn't terrible either lol
My best friend is supposed to come over next week_comma_ but due to weather she may not come until later. I really miss her so I hope she visits soon.
She lives in Alaska and I live in Indiana_comma_ so it's a bit far! And I don't have many real friends so I've been feeling a bit lonely.
My son is going to college in a couple of days and I'm sure the house will be a lot quieter without him.. I think the empty nest feeling is inevitable
No_comma_ just one. Always wanted to have more but it just wasn't meant to be
I sure hope so. At least the colleges is only 3 hours away 
I rented a house on the beach this summer. It was so dirty that I couldn't stay. There were cockroachs everywhere.
No_comma_ I was not able to. I need to sue the landlord.
My 14 year old daughter applied for an internship all m herself for over the summer
She got it too. She was able to work at the schools summer camp and get a free week of camp herself!
I hope so!
I am envious of my coworker_comma_ he is very smart and athletic
I guess so_comma_ but they are still kind of a better version of me
i was scared to walk home alone yesterday
cause there were werewolves out there
I was in an antique store and found a really old coin for cheap. It was real and its very valuable. I'm so happy!
Yeah I don't think I will sell it though. It's got a good backstory. 
I really hate when my kids take my things without asking
It's true tho. They will one day understand when the spend their own money on things and someone just comes along and breaks it or leaves at the mall.
I hope tht time comes sooner thatn later
Tomorrow is my 14th year anniversary married to my wonderful husband. I can't believe it was that long ago. What a wonderful day.
No_comma_ not this year.  We are going to dinner outside in a vineyard that is local to us.  I'm really looking forward to it.
I am hoping the Eagles can win it all again this season!
I do not_comma_ but I live right outside of it_comma_ so I get the culture
I was shocked when my parents got me a car for graduation
It was_comma_ it runs and that is all I could ask for
I can't beleive my kids ruined my house so quickly.
I ordered a pizza and they left their plates and drinks everywhere and throw all of the pillows off of the couches. I don't know why
i couldve killed the_comma_
I cant believe I hit reply all instead of reply when sending an email.
I was complaining to my boss about another employee and I accidentally sent it to the whole company.  I cant believe I did that.  Im glad its the weekend.  I dont want to go back there
I interned for a Physical Education class for third graders. I haven't been a third grader for a long time_comma_ so I was surprised how intelligent they are! They go through a lot of stuff_comma_ too.
See_comma_ that's how I remember it to! One of the kids I spent time with that semester opened up about his dad's drinking problem and he was holding it together pretty well. I didn't realize that kids went through that kind of stuff_comma_ I mean I know they do but you get what I mean.
I was talking with my brother and he lied to me. I'm so gullible though it takes me awhile to realize it. 
He told me that he got a big bonus from work. I found out from my mom though that he lost his job instead. 
MY friend is getting married soon.
I hope I get married first
I just started a business.
It is an online retail business.  I have been studying about it for years and finally pulled the trigger.  I know it will end up being a great business.
My wife just quit her job to start her own private practice.
No she's a Therapist_comma_ but she is pursuing her Doctorate.
Really looking forward to tomorrow night!
Going to an MMA show.  Taking my nephew too!
Yeah I can't wait!!
My girlfriend just broke up with me. My coworkers had donuts sitting on my desk this morning to cheer me up. I never thought they would do something like that.
Yea and they must have got to work early because I am usually there before them. 
I love my neices and nephews so much
All the time. I treat them the same as my own kids. They are the best
I have three kids. Three neices and one nephew
My birthday is next month and my wife has a surprise planned.
I don't know what it is and I am really looking forward to it.
I am seeing a lot of litter on the ground these days around my school... really chaps me.
I know_comma_ right? People are just so lazy or don't care I guess.
I was watching TV and stopped on the Discover channel. There was this really gross show on bugs_comma_ but I couldn't help but watch. 
Yeah_comma_ I don't really know. It was really really gross. 
I went into my garage the other day and there was a new car in there.
It was mine!  My wife had bought it for me for my birthday_comma_ but she wanted me to be shocked by it so she gave it to me a month early.
It is actually a classic car_comma_ so not technically new.  It was a 1959 corvette.  It is my dream car come true.
I enjoyed the Broadway show Hamilton. I didn't think I would.
The ending was really good.
My nephew starts 10th grade this year!
Yeah i'm sure he will.  He's a good kid.  He's playing football too!
Me too!  I can't wait to see him play!
My buddy just came to work showing off his big new tundra.
Ha no_comma_ but I'm still super happy with my little old Tacoma!
I am always amazed when people poses talent
I was out to dinner the other night a I saw a magician do some amazing card tricks.  I couldnt figure them out and I was blown away
I'm a big fan of superhero movies. I can't wait for the next Marvel Universe movie to come out! 
He really is! I love a good villian!
I had to leave my parents behind in the country I grew up in. I haven't seen them in 12 years and I cry a lot thinking about them
Bulgaria. It's so far away!
it's been almost 20 years and I've only been back to Bulgaria once!
People are nice and caring_comma_ nature is beautiful and life kinda slows down_comma_ it's not as crazy hectic  as here
I'm a little sad my youngest son is starting Kindergarten in a few days.
I know it does! My oldest son is starting Junior High..wow
Yeah I'm grateful that I get to work from home and be with my kids.
The summer has been rough though. They fight a lot
I saw a man on the street and he looked so sad. He had no one and I kept on walking by to leave him alone.
I don't really know. He just seemed so discheviled and alone.
Sometimes things really arent fair.  I wanted to steal from my cousin
My grandma gave my cousin and I a scratch off lottery ticket.  He won $100 and I didnt win anything.  I was really upset
I just broke my finger_comma_ and I have a golf tournament coming up.
I think it will be fine.  This is a big tournament for me_comma_ so I am keeping my fingers crossed (as much as possible) that it will heal in time for me to play.
Tomorrow_comma_ I will be evicted from my appartment. I don't know what to do.
In time of need_comma_ my friends started running away from you.
from me
I checked my mail yesterday
I got a check in the mail from my insurance company.  Didn't expect that!

The other day I was at the store and this guy was carrying like 40 bags all by himself! It was really amazing!
He was just walking out_comma_ looking like the Hulk
My dog Ronnie just died. He was hit by a car and it was the worst thing that ever happened to me. 
Yeah it was really rough. I miss him a lot.
I have_comma_ but I don't think that I'm there yet. Maybe sometime though. 
Did you ever do something in your childhood that you arent proud of?
Oh how much? I cheated on a test and got caught.  My teacher wrote "cheater" on it and my mom saved it and I saw that test often
I saw a guy scratching his behind on the train this morning.
I was too grossed out to talk to him_comma_ besides_comma_ I thought it was none of my business?
I watched the scariest movie on TV last night. It gave me the creeps and I couldn't sleep I was so terrified!
It was Insidious. Don't watch it by yourself if you want to sleep.
I was at work_comma_ and one of my friends had to go. I was so mad_comma_ because that meant I had to do all the work!
Yeah_comma_ I was super tired for a day though
Yes! I took a nice bath
I'm not looking forward to tomorrow :/
We're taking the kiddos to six flags and they're gonna make me ride coasters lol
Yeah I've never rode one before!  So scared :(
Hey thanks!  Wish you could go too!!
My husband says he stopped drinking but I'm reluctant to believe him
He's said it before and nothing's changed. I don't want to get my hopes up.
My buddy at work just went and bought a really nice boat.
Lol I feel the same way.  I don't even like fishing but I would kill for that boat.
I'm being induced on Monday because I'll be at 41 weeks pregnant by then. This is my first baby and I'm so scared! Labor seems impossible!
Really?  That's good to hear.  I have been told so many different horror stories that its got me feeling nauseated and stressed!
I was at my favorite restaurant and the owner gave me a complimentary meal because I eat there so often!
It's a mexican restaurant 
Some Chicken Enchilladas 
I took a third trip to the grocery store hoping to find good clearance items this week like I normally do.
Nope I didn't find anything! Super disappointed. It's not been a good week to get clearance stuff.
I was at a restaurant and the waiter didn't serve us at all! She was so lazy! I was so dissapointed.
Yes! We got some free drinks basically!
Our dining room is just a few steps down from the kitchen_comma_ so I made me a bowl of ravioli and fell down the 3 steps somehow. I got ravioli all over me.
I was fine_comma_ but my roommate heard the noise and came to check. Needless to say I was pretty embaressed when he found me lying in a pool of ravioli on the floor.
I couldn't find my phone all day_comma_ but when I finally did_comma_ I hadn't missed a single call or text.
It was in the couch_comma_ but really it just made me realize I need to hang out wih some friends.
my wife is amazing_comma_ shes the only one i want
i try everyday!
I wasn't happy today when someone ran in to the back of my moms car.
Nope! They ran into her then drove off- an old guy!

My 3 year old got into some oil that I had sitting down on the counter just for one minute. He dumped it all over the couch and living room floor. It took everything I had not to explode.

That is such a good idea!  I don't really venture on there but I'm desperate!  You really think there would be a video about taking oil off of couch cushions?!!  Thanks_comma_ you've given me hope!
I went to a restaurant where they cook in front of you and it was very cool! I had some teriyaki chicken

I tried but can't. I'm going to give it another shot though!
I recently moved to a new city and I don't have any friends here
I have_comma_ but I'm too scared to get involved because I have so much going on. I'd hate to flake out on people
I am here at home alone while all my friends are out at the lake today.  :(
No_comma_ I ended up getting sick last night from something I ate I think.
I was happy that I called my mom in time for her birthday this year.  I felt good about myself that I'm a good son who still keeps in touch with his mom.
Thanks :) she did a lot_comma_ actually
My friend forgot to tell me he wasn't coming over so I missed out on other plans like going to a game!

I got a puppy for my birthday!
I did until I noticed that when I took him outside to go to the bathroom_comma_ he was eating the neighbor dog's doo doo.

My daughter is at her job interview. I'm sure she got it in the bag.

No_comma_ we actually called animal control first.
My baby is due in less than 2 months.
My friends threw me a baby shower yesterday. I had no idea they were planning it.
I spent two hours yesterday washing and detailing my car.  Afterwards_comma_ a short time later_comma_ it started storming and my car got filthy again.
I was not happy to say the least.  Next time I will just take it to the car wash rather that waste my free time
Sometimes I feel more ready to go on a date with a super attractive girl if I've got a couple of drinks in me.
Every once in a while.
I joined a dancing class
Not at all. I'm going to learning!
When I was at college_comma_ some tenagers were extorting money from me.
They threating me_comma_ beating me. I was too afraid to say anything.
I know I shouldn't have_comma_ but I texted a girl to ask her on a date.
I'm still waiting to hear back.
Got a huge delivery. Not even sure I can get it through the door.
Don't think I ordered anything. I don't even recognize the company it's from.
If I get a good pump at the gym early in the morning_comma_ I feel like I can tackle any task on my to-do list for the day
Not usually.  Been trying to a lot more lately though hbu
I finally made my own pizza. I think it's gonna be good.
Yea_comma_ the dough was. I'm not really good at kneading it seems.
I went to the doctor recently for my annual check-up_comma_ I always think they're going to tell me something's wrong.
For sure_comma_ even though they usually find nothing it's hard to shake the worry off.
There's a turtle in my yard.
What are you gonna do with it? I have no idea what kind it is. It has a fat shell.

He felt so bad. She was trying to humiliating me.
My cat is at the kitty spa.
Yep. He's having a pretty good time.
I might get a haircut tonight.  Nothing like a high fade to get me feeling fresh and ready to chat up some honeys
Used to do it myself but found a great guy...so these days bout every week
I work a lot_comma_ but I'm not worried. My wife is amazing and would never cheat on me.

my kids left and i felt all alone

Well_comma_ I am stuck at work today.  I had bought a lottery ticket last week thinking I wouldn't have to work this week. lol
As you might imagine I was quite bummed to find out that I didn't even match one number!
i was pissed when i saw someone put a dent in my door
yea .. people dont care about other people's property anymore
My dog is getting older and is starting to walk a little slower these days.
I haven't in a while_comma_ but I definitely should. I don't think there's much they can do though
A coworker helped me move to another city. He was so kind.
No_comma_ I sold the heavy appliances before moving but he helped me moved my stuff. I thankful to him.
I'm happy that I've got more maturity and self-discipline than most of my friends.  Based on my bank account and current income I can tell hen it's a good time to party and when it's a good time to stay in.  This situation also explains why most of them are broke and I'm not.
Yup. Are you staying in or going out tonight
i loved taking care of my sisters pet
its a bearded dragon
its about a year old
i was pissed when i saw someone had put a dent in my door
walmart parking lot 
Last week I had a wardrobe malfunction at work.
My dress got shut in my car door and then it ripped as I tried walking away.
i was irked when i couldnt get the day off
too much work to have time off approved 
My coworker always seems to due my job better than me. She's nothing special so I'm so upset about that. 
We are both sales reps at a car dealer. 
I'm amazed at how much better I've gotten at writing lyrics in just 6 months it's crazy.
I write mainly hip hop lyrics.  Not the dumb commercial trap rap_comma_ more introspective stuff 
I made a mistake at work. My manager have set a meeting to talk about it. I am a little bit worried.
I don't know. My manager seemed a little bit angry.
i was hoping to get the day off
so i can go clubbing
The lottery ticket I bought last night did not win.
Rarely do I bother buying one.
It would have been a well invested dollar had I won.
I ordered pizza and it should be here any moment. I keep looking out the window to check_comma_ and I can feel my brain slowly turning into a caveman brain I'm so hungry.
Aha_comma_ I'm sorry! If it makes you any less hungry it's a vegetarian pizza because the wife doesn't eat meat.
I used to get excited over getting girls' numbers...nowadays I get excited over free cash and paying off credit card bills
Haha wow that's commitment right there
i cant wait for monday!
kids start school
I draw for about an hour almost every day_comma_ and I've been doing it for a long time. I only ever just wanted to be able to draw fun doodles_comma_ but the other day I looked and I actually feel good about my drawing skills_comma_ finally.
It really does! It was miserable starting because you put so much effort into something you don't even like the end result of_comma_ but it's well worth it.
"I got first place in a 1 mile race today.
I started running again about 3 years ago.
Too much of anything is bad.
I just had my first baby last week.
It has been great! Motherhood is such a wonderful experience.
i loved taking care of my sisters pet
its a bearded dragon
I used to try so hard to find that one perfect partner to stay loyal to...until I found out that my dreams are the only thing worth chasing
That's cool
I just knew I bombed this chemistry test and we got the results yesterday. I somehow squeaked by with a B!
Thanks! Chemistry is real hard to me.
I broke down and finally watched the film "A Quiet Place" last night.  It is the first time in my adult life that I wanted a night light when I went to bed.
I am not good with horror movies.  I might have to admit that I am not as tough as I pretend to be I guess.
i was upset when i couildnt leave work
yea .. i mean the work is going to be there waiting for me the next day.. 
Whew! Finally got to mow my horribly large yard before it got too tall and it starts raining
Over an hour _comma_ but in this heat it makes it very exhausting
It was perfect timing_comma_ I was almost done and it started raining
i was happy to see i got next week off!
yes it is!
I really liked fossils so I went to my local museum. It was pretty cool and they had a lot of awesome fossils. 
Yeah they are pretty great!
i cant wait for monday!
kids return to school!
I had my transmission fluid changed today. Hope I did the right thing.
Afterwards I thought I heard in the past that it has to be done very carefully. Can't remember exactly. 
It cost enough_comma_ almost 75 dollars
I found out my dog has cancer today
I'm not sure how bad it is yet. Have to wait for tests to come back

My buddy started to turn pale_comma_ I just envisioned him throwing up all over my car.
I couldnt_comma_  didnt have the heart I tried to push his head out the window as best I could.
A friend of mine died Thursday and I hadn't called her in about in a month
I couldn't be around her much because she on pills really bad.
My mother was too and that's why I couldn't be around her much also
I'm just thinking about quitting my job. My boss is the worst; every time he asks for my idea_comma_ if it works it becomes "his" idea and if it fails it's "your" idea.
I'll try that first_comma_ but it's hard to report someone for just being really terrible in general.
Nothing like a fresh pair of Air Nikes to make me feel ready to take on the world
Some ppl think you need 20 different pairs.  Me I just need 2-3 with good arch support and knee comfort and I'm gold
I tried to flirt with my crush and completely made a fool of myself.
I tried to call her pretty and stumbled over my words.
i was scared walking home alone last week
someone followed me home
I was a cheater in highs school. I always got some nerd to help me_comma_ bet now I really regret it. 
Yeah_comma_ but that  doesn't stop me from being upset about it. 
My friend got a hole in one the other day.  It was just his second time ever playing golf!  Talk about unexpected.
Ha!  Me too.  And I have been playing golf for years.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me when I saw the ball go in!
My uncle died in a car crash yesterday.
Thanks.  It sucks.
i was crushed when i didnt win the lottery
heh
i was upset to see someone put a dent in my door
yea
I just saw a brown recluse crawling on my desk.
Yikes. I hate them.   I've been bit by one before.
On my arm... Fairly bad.
Every Christmas song I hear on the radio for some reason reminds me of my extended family back home and the good times we had when I was younger.
No hopefully soon though. Hbu
I'm am so afraid of the dark. I can't fall asleep so I have to have a light on in order to fall asleep. 
Yeah ever since I was a little kid. 
I've just had some bad experiences in the dark as a kid. 
i am hoping to go to hawaii next year
No i have never been but i hope i am able to one day.
I am anxiously awaiting a second puppy from a dog I rescued. I thought she might be pregnant but then I thought she wasn't after a week. 
She was on the streets and starved and trying to get run over.
Not something I can do generally as it takes so much time and money but if I see an animal in need in front of my home_comma_ I will always help :)
Super shocked when our rescued malnourished dog popped out a puppy when I got up this morning!
Yes! I think she may have another one coming...and I pray not! I have enough dogs :( And a puppy is a lot of work
Thanks! lol!!
i was pissed when i saw someone had left my gate open and my dog was missing
yea but someone from the water company had to get to the back to do something and forgot to shut it when they were done
My new dog keeps trying to sit on her new puppy. It's making me quite upset. 
Yes_comma_ I h ave to moniter her all day and it's stressed me out. She is being very obsessive and freaks out if she is away from her puppy....Sigh!
Yes_comma_ she is young..and clearly very neglected as she was starved...Can't even believe she had a healthy puppy..I think something weird happened to her pups before. Poor dog!
Oh! I had too_comma_ my neighbor was going to hit her and she was desperate for help. I was so scared...as I have taken in a female pit before and it was so stressful as she would try to eat everyone..but this girl is very docile to other animals.
I'm nervous about going to work on Monday. I have a meeting with my boss but I don't know what it's about Can you give me any advice?
Yeah I guess that could be true_comma_ but my company hasn't been doing well lately and a lot of people have already been laid off. 
Yeah_comma_ I just don't want to have to find another job though. I twould mean I may have to move to a different city with my family. 
Our new dog who was starved just had a puppy today. We thought she was pregnant before but after a week of food- she seemed to have a normal stomach.
She is a tiny pit bull. A pocket pit! I can't believe she had a healthy puppy after how starved she was. The puppy is small but that could be from her being starved. It looks like a pitbull mix as well. So cute! And very quiet.
:) I love them all! Cats_comma_ dogs_comma_ bunnies_comma_ BUGS lol- wildlife :) Oh- I could never leave an abused animal to be hurt outside. They are so innocent_comma_ it would like be leaving a baby outside
I've got more sympathy for poor people who are actually trying to improve their situation_comma_ than those who are just looking for a handout
Agreed.  It's a common misconception to think all poor people are lazy.  Some just have it rougher than others I know I did coming from a third world country.  But now I'm fully self-employed own my own car rent my own apartment and live life on my own terms
I'm so upset. My dog that I've had ever since he was a little puppy just died. We were friends for 20 years. 
Thanks. He was really old and had a lot of health problems so it really was for the best. 
Yeah_comma_ there's a gapping hole im my life right now. 
I was thankfully ready for when a puppy came today. I have lots of clean blankets_comma_ a clean room and extra money if needed!
Oh goodness yes...and I just have the momma from the last week! oi! 2 new dogs in a week.
I know right? She is really sweet though and isn't crazy or obnoxious so it's not too bad
I am so excited to see my family. I haven't been home in sooooo long. 
Well I have a younger brother who is in high school and I haven't seen him or my parents in a really long time. I feel like I miss so much!
Its for school. I go to university 1000 miles away 
Well...our abused starved gal had herself a puppy today! I was incredibly shocked.
GAL! ;)
Oh he was just born today. I have rescued for years and sometimes it takes quite a few weeks to see their personality and decide on a name :) He is very docile though and has a cute pushed in face_comma_ a little blonde fawn boy
I'm feeling pretty blessed these days...I know I can always trace it back to the love_comma_ support_comma_ and steadfast belief of my parents that I can achieve anything I set my mind to
They are the best I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for them I thank God every day for them.
Super sad this weekend. I wish my partner would be done with therapy already and be home 
3 years. but I also know I have a lot of ptsd from him and it will be a long road before I am ready to be around him again. But you know...at the same time it's hard!!!
I hope so too. Thank you!
I bought a pomegranate the other day on a whim. I haven't had one since I was a kid_comma_ so it brought back from memories when I was snacking on it.
It's really hard to explain. They're good_comma_ but they're kind of tricky to eat_comma_ and eat little ball of fruit you eat has a big seed you have to eat around. So think of something tasty that's effort to eat_comma_ like sunflower seeds (but better.) The flavor is too unique to explain.
Umm_comma_ they're kind of juicy the way a watermelon is but actually a raspberry might not be too far from it. I love watermelons_comma_ by the way.
When I was a kid and people asked what was my favorite fruit_comma_ I'd never say watermelon because in my mind that was cheating. OBVIOUSLY watermelon would have to be anyone's favorite. Only later in life did I realize not everyone liked it like I did.
i was crushed when i didnt win the lottery
well now you tell me!
We were going to go swimming today. The weather was bad though so we had to cancel
Stay home and watch tv
Marvel makes the best superhero movies! I can't wait for the next one to come out!
Well the next Infinity Wars is out in 2019 so that's a long time to wait!
Iron Man of course!
I decided to treat myself tonight and make grill a huge steak for myself tonight.
Yeah it would have been if I hadn't burned it to a crisp and turned it into a black charred piece of leather!
I'm always feeling like I'm on the verge of something awesome about to happen. I don't know what it is it must be the winning streak I'm on these days
Yes everyday $$$$
My friends left him in the middle of the night. I feel sick for him
Sorry_comma_ My friends wife left him in the middle the night. It made me sick
i was upset when i saw my dog was missing
yea_comma_ he gone.
There's a huge stuffed bear on my yard.
Agree. Not sure what I should do with it.
I was really calm today. I just sat on the patio and read
It was very much needed
I checked my mail and was so shocked. There was a check with a $1000 in an evelope with my name on it!
Yeah I'm a little worried that it isn't real. 
i was happy to see that i was off next week
just chillin is about all i have planned so far.
Lady Luck is the only woman in my life who hasn't failed me yet (besides my mom lol)...I see a lot of good things in our future together $$$$$$
Because my life is the epitome of that Drake song blessings on blessings on blessings ;)
I was scared driving home last night. It felt like I was being followed
The downtown area
My weekend is going well so far. I am hoping tomorrow nothing bad happens
Well it's been bad sundays for awhile_comma_ so I am hoping it isn't this time :) Someone acts up on Sundays...it's ridiculous
I hope so too! Thank you. Bipolar is no fun for those of us around those people
i went into that interview knowing i was going to crush it
Well it didnt start out that way but over the years I have become better at these types of things
I'm so made at George Lucas. How could he think something like the Phantom Menace would be a good idea for a movie!
I don't know I like to think he is better than that. 
My friend bought me a programming course.
Yea_comma_ it is. I was just talking about how I wanted to learn yesterday_comma_ and the next thing is this course in my email.
i loved taking care of my sisters pet
a bearded dragon
One big pet peeve of mine is a poor person complaining about his/her situation and doing absolutely nothing to fix it
My point exactly.  You're a hard worker despite your physical pains.  I was born in a third world country and am now self-employed with full financial autonomy_comma_ my own car_comma_ apartment_comma_ and supportive friends and family...DON'T TELL ME you can't fix your life. You just don't want it bad enough
i really wanted to get pregnant but month after month it didn't happen
i'm getting up there in years so i'm kind of at the end of the line. i suppose it may not meant be to be
that is very kind of you. may you be blessed with health_comma_ wealth_comma_ and success also.
Got a $100 Costco cash card. Gonna spend it all at the food court.
Yes. 10 weeks of pizza goodness!
My nextdoor neighbor is getting dementia.
Her family.. sort of... but not really..
Yep_comma_ and she's starting to try to wander off.
I was speeding_comma_ because I was worried about my mom.
The cop actually let me off!
I am shocked my dog had a healthy baby after being starved for most of her pregnancy!
No idea. Her former owners never came forward and they would NEVER have gotten her back anyway unless they had just rescued her. I can't believe they starved her period..but that they starved a pregnant dog! Seriously?? She was so incredibly thin..I could see her entire hip bones and she was RAVENOUS and thirsty for a week!
I know right??? And yet so many are..even with KIDS! 
I was a little sad with the weather today. We had to cancel plans
Very much so_comma_ and the wind was blowing
Life can be hard sometimes or even often. 
Just dealing with difficult people. They are everywhere! Even in your own home sometimes!  I just don't understand why people can't just be kind and good and instead want to hurt and destroy
A lot are narcissists nowadays too! it's shocking how many people are
I stayed up all night to decorate the office.
It's definitely ready for a retirement party. I'm gonna miss her.
I am getting a new cat tree tomorrow_comma_ it finally went on sale. 
It's a gift for me too because I am happy when they are happy. They need one for the cat room bad! One I have wanted for a long time that I see in my pet store! I am not happy unless I get something 80% off or more."
I can't deal with anything less then 80% off..sometimes 50% if it's something I need bad
i cant wait for monday!
the kids are going back to school :p
Everyday in every way I'm getting better and better.  Still waiting on my big come up but I'm in no rush_comma_ just enjoying the view ;)
Thanks.  
I miss my coworker. Her replacement just isn't the same.
Yea. We keep in touch online. She definitely set up some high standards for us around here.
My external hard disk has stop working. I had very important data on it. It can't be fixed.
I can't do anything to retrieve the data. I had personal pictures and videos on it. I am sad of losing them.
I think I've got popcorn kernels to last me through retirement. I wonder how long they keep for.
Yea_comma_ it is. Do you like popcorn?
I didn't get a job I interviewed for.
Yep_comma_ I've already got more applicaions out :|
i was mad when i saw there was a dent in my car door.
nah it was while i was at walmart
I am looking forward to tomorrow. We are going kayaking
Yeah_comma_ it should be really fun
My sister n law washed my clothes today for me. It was a nice gesture
Yeah it was very sweet
My brother like spiders but I am scared of them! I can't handle those things!
Yeah I don't know either. 
Even more upset then I already was that the dog I rescued was not only starved but starved AND pregnant.
I know right? I can't find out who had her but it was someone near me as she was running 2 weeks ago like a demon was after her and almost got hit- No way she was loose for any amount of time but right that moment.
I was pretty annoyed at the store earlier. The cashiers were being slow
I think so_comma_ that must be the case
Got a lot done this week_comma_ made good money_comma_ got things I needed_comma_ some I wanted and still saved up!
What am I NOT saving up for is the question_comma_ lol. Saving up for any emergency always. They happen a lot in my life. No big upsets though this week_comma_ it's been a good week!
Oh..I haven't always been able to save...We all wish we can..but if I can_comma_ I do..I have been in too many bad spots before
i was mad when i saw my dog was missing
he dug a hole and got out of the backyard and has not returned.
I found out a very simple part to my lawn mower is VERY expensive from all the mower parts places. 
The recoil puller. Just the cord and casing that makes it start. I was angry because it is literally 5 times the price that it is online from all kinds of stores. I just don't get why they are charging $65 for a little plastic cord???
Oh..I can't afford that! lol! Even if I could- It's a simple part. Oh...I am not really but I am good at researching is all :) I would much rather keep my savings them buy a new mower. This one works great_comma_ just the pull cord is broke.
Nothing pumps me up more these days than money making opportunities where I have full autonomy of time
C.R.E.A.M. baby
trying to same money for a trip. trying to get pregnant. just lots of stuff
to see my family. they are 800 miles away
i hope that we can make it happen.
im ready for next week!
the kids start school
Looking forward to getting my cats a new cat tree tomorrow! It is a warehouse deal so I am hoping it is in good shape!
Oh they are happy with anything. Animals are usually grateful beings :) It was one I have been watching for awhile and the price finally dropped to my ideal
I was a little upset earlier. My brother did not meet me for lunch
I did not hear from him at all
i am happy that the kids return to school next week
yea_comma_ its time!
My friend's home is being foreclosed on.
She would have to come up with a lot of money
i was pissed when i forgot my house keys at work
yea i had to wait outside till my wife got home
It was a nice day. I just sat on the patio and relaxed
It was really needed
My friend has been very distant lately.
She says everything is okay_comma_ but it's definitely not.
I was angry last night. My friend was drunk and irritating
Yeah I wish they were funny
I was pulled over for speeding the other day.  The cop actually was really cool and just gave me a warning.  I was very relieved.
Either he was just feeling generous or it was my lucky day.  Either way I really appreciated it
I interviewed for a jew job on friday. I think it went well.
Yeah sometimes.  I think this one went well.
Me too. I've been dying to get out of my current job for about a year now.
i was saddened to see i didnt win the lottery
yea its a bummer two times a week every week for me :p
i am so glad that i have an understanding and kind husband
nothing. i've just had some really bad relationships in my life and it makes me so glad to have him
thank you. it feels really good to have that in my life finally.
Hoping this next week is going to be a good paying work week too!
I work online doing various tasks for different companies. It's been a stellar past 2 weeks and I love it!
These days I've got my mind to the horizon of my dreams...because my feet are always taking giant leaps and landing where I need them to
...yes
When I grew up_comma_ I didn't appreciate my brother who raised me because my family was so busy. Now as an adult_comma_ I realized all the times I resented him_comma_ he was just trying to help me. He did so much by putting me through college. I can't help but get teary when I realize how much he cared about me.
Yup_comma_ family gets more and more important as I get older. Now he has his own kid_comma_ and I cannot help but want to help my brother raise his kid because that is what he did for me. Weird how you don't realize things when you're younger.
I tripped last night in front of people. I felt bad about it
People saw me do it
i was scared being home alone last night
kept hearing sounds around the house with no one else at home
Got seasons pass to an amusement park.

i enjoy gardening and seeing what all the hard work will lead to
tomato_comma_ green beans_comma_ cucumber_comma_ watermelon_comma_cantelope_comma_ green peppers_comma_ potatoes_comma_ and spicy peppers
they are struggling a little.  i believe gardens are hit and miss based on the weather 
I've got these shoes for over 5 years now. The sole is all worn out.
Yea but I'll miss these. I bought them with my first paycheck.
I don't get mad easy.  But if there's anything that ticks me off a lot it's someone who tries too hard to make an impression.  Like if I like you I like you if I don't I don't it's that simple really haha
Exactly.
It took me 5 hours to bake this cake for my daughter_comma_ and now it's missing.
I hope not.
i was crushed when i didnt win the lottery
I only buy one.
I am thinking tomorrow is going to be nice. I am going to church
That is a good idea_comma_ I just might
My mom went on a diet and lost 40lbs.
I know_comma_ I'm really glad she stuck to it.
Its really important_comma_ especially as you get older.
My brother is taking me to church tomorrow. Its a nice gesture from him
I do not_comma_ but I am looking forward to it
i was mad when i saw my dog got out
he dug a hole
I had a great two weeks with work
It's better then the alternative for sure! I made enough to even get a few things I wanted and to save up! I love it when those things happen.
My brother is getting married. I am so happy for him

I know right? I haven't been able to do that much in life. I have a few different savings accounts. Vet emergencies_comma_ car emergencies_comma_ life emergencies etc
i am really looking forward to taking a few days away from work before the end of the year
we haven't had one this year. it's mostly just cuz i'm burnt out at work and at my breaking point.
i don't know. somedays i worry about it. i hope so.
I still have the computer my dad got me back in 1998 or so.
Yea. They seem so fast to me back then!
My new job promised a raise at the end of 90 days_comma_ but I still haven't heard anything
They better. Otherwise_comma_ I'm going to be job hunting.
I watched my friends dog for her. She is going through some things so I wanted to look out for her
I try to be I guess
i was mad when my dog got loose
yea he likes to dig and go run around  the sub division. 
I put in vacation request months ago and am now just being told they can't grant it.
I don't know really_comma_ but I think that's my last straw with them.
We homeschool our girls and my oldest had to take a biology class last year.
Yes_comma_ we did it at home.  She had to dissect several things and I could not watch it.  She had to do it with my husband instead.
I haven't been able to find my favorite pineapple coconut cake anywhere_comma_ but there's a new bakery opening up soon
I'm going to check it out. I just want someone to make a pineapple coconut cake.
I am helping a friend that has lost his job recently.
It has been three month. I am little bit worried about him because he is starting to be depressed.
I saw a bunch of guinea pigs gang up on a pig
I think it was a tie_comma_ but I don't think it was fair for the pig_comma_ man.
i cant wait for monday to get here!

Can't believe this cat lept from a 10 foot tall slide.
I don't think I'll want to mess with one after that.

Oh no_comma_ I hit the wrong button. Sorry_comma_ I miss my dad this time of year. It makes me think of him
Just being outside in the summer
Thank goodness it's already August! Autumn is my favorite season.
Where do you live? I moved only a few weeks ago from Alabama_comma_ and it was always hot there.
Someone left their trash in the bed of my truck.
No clue. Some people are jerks.
Tell me about it.   There are some seriously crappy people out there.
i am so happy the kids are going back to school.
one of them is_comma_ the other does not want to return.. oh well.
I've been having some serious headaches lately. I don't know why.
I hate going to the doctor though.
I bought some treats for my cat this weekend. I just had a plan
Just to make sure he can have fun with new toys and not rely on me so much
He can be ha
I ate the last piece of cake.
It was tres leche. I have no regrets_comma_ but there will be very upset people.
Tomorrow is going to be fun. We are going hiking and kayaking
Its 30 minutes away_comma_ but its so nice
The hotdog I had tasted pretty funky. I'm not sure if it's gone bad
Yea_comma_ me too. I don't even know why I finished it.
I have entered a poker tournament for next weekend.  I think I have a pretty good chance at winning.
It takes practice for sure.  Really the more experience you have the better you get.
I broke up with my girlfriend this same time last year
Nope. I haven't felt anything for anyone since.
i can't stand to go the bathroom at work after someone else
i try. sometimes i can't help it and i have to and goodness it was awful
it's like man if you are going to the bathroom please use spray
i was mad when i saw my dog was missing
he has been gone a week
So no real plans this weekend... Just sitting here alone.
Yeah I didn't think about that. Could see some benefit there..
All the lights in my neighborhood has gone out except my home. People are looking at my home weird now.
I have no idea. Somehow we lucked out_comma_ and now the neighbors are expecting stuff from us now.
I did pretty good on my math test.
I was able to make a 95. I studied really hard to get that.
I felt pretty alone today. I did not hear from anyone
I did not. I was pretty lazy
i was not happy when i was told that i had to go into work on saturday
yea you got that right
I get sad this time of year. It makes me think of my dad
I have memories_comma_ so thats better than nothing
i wasnt happy when i had to go into work on saturday
yea it isnt :(
I have felt alone all weekend. I guess my friends were busy
I did get to relax a lot
I was scared driving on thursday. It was raining so hard

Super excited about some moisturizer I am getting tomorrow. 
Very true! I have to have a good moisturizer. It seems like I can't ever find the right one for my skin so I am hoping this works.
I have the opposite_comma_ I just can't seem to soak in any moisture and my skin is so dry! Also certain oils make me break out :/ It has been a pickle!
My brother got a job promotion. I am happy for him
It was pay raise and title change
I got the wrong part for my mower.
It said it fit my lawn mower but it didn't_comma_. Such a bummer! So I don't know how to get the right part? I have to pay extra now :/
It's a discontinued mower and strangely it seems hard to find any part numbers for the engine. So strange
I start a new job on monday.
It's an IT job.
Fixing computers and such.  "IT Analyst" is the job title
Happy with my momma dog. I would've thought after all her abuse she wouldn't be that good of a momma
I don't agree as humans can be terrible mothers and I have seen animals crush their own offspring..eat them or leave them. It happens! but she is trying hard to be and is very protective. It's nice. I don't have to bottle feed
it was impressive to see lebron sign with the lakers and leave the cavs a second time
yea you just dont see big time players do that so its fun to see when it does happen
i really love to look at old photo albums and see how everyone has grown and how things have changed
i love seeing my family grow and the kids all have kids now
thanks. you too
My friend got to go on a trip this weekend without me. I am pretty envious
I had to work
My neighbor is out again having a party...I find it strange because he yelled at me on a night before when he was working...but it's okay when he wants too?
They are very strange. I don't understand that selfishness. People work all different days and hours. Of course he doesn't have the nerve to go yell at the people who set off fireworks all night after 10. 
I was making myself a pancake the other day and my dog kept bothering me.
No_comma_ he's my right hand man so I had to let it slide.
i loved taking care of my sisters pet the other day
a bearded dragon
I forgot my mom's birthday was 2 days ago
That's a great idea. I'll do that!
Starting some new herbs and I am a bit scared I might have bad effects.
Oh yes_comma_ I research everything a LOT but I have such a sensitive system and I'm allergic to so many things..So I hope they help instead of hurt
I am looking forward to tomorrow_comma_ Church should be fun
Its a normal baptist church
My friends left to dinner without me since I canceled last minute
I had to work. If I said no to work_comma_ I'd just be putting a bullseye on my back.
I was sitting in traffic the other day because there was a wreck up ahead.
I think so_comma_ there were just a lot of cars involved.  But this crazy person decided he was more important than anyone else and zoomed up the emergency lane blocking the ambulance that was trying to get to the wreck.
This summer heat is almost over!
Fall and spring are my favorite seasons. Can't deal with these extreme weathers lol.
i cant wait for next week!
the kids go back to school
4 of them!
I'm getting married next weekend!
No_comma_ we are just going to go sign the papers lol. We're saving for a home.
I asked my friend to get some stuff for a party_comma_ I knew I could count on him though.
Yeah it makes you grateful to have people in your life like that_comma_ gotta hold on to them.
I'm so glad it's going to be fall soon.
How how is it where you are?
I've got a date tomorrow afternoon. I think its going go to well.3
I think it will. I'm feeling pretty good.
My friend is always at least 30 minutes late to everything.
hahaha how do you deal with it?
im hoping to win the lottery tonight
all i need is ONE!
I had a test yesterday_comma_ but I made sure to study throughout the week before.
I think it went well and that I am confident.
i hoped that my supervisor or director would acknowledge my hard work
they don't make me feel acknowledged or appreciated
i hope so because i don't want to leave my job but i don't want to feel unappreciated and invisible either
I miss my dog this time of year.
She passed away.
I opened the back door to let my dog out and a giant roach tried to fly in the door.
He did but I killed him.
Gotta defend your house_comma_ ya know?
I lost 20 pounds this year. Think I'll look great in my suit.
I ate the same but exercised a lot more. I knew I couldn't give up the foods I loved.
You know actually speaking on that_comma_ I've historically been a terrible cook but I've been practicing a lot and I'm getting really comfortable with where I'm at. I made caramel-fudge brownies today and they were reaaally good.
My boss from work has all sorts of recipes like that. She taught me how to make Jalapeno Pepper Jelly_comma_ and that's so excellent on biscuits. You should try it if you haven't had it before.
We keep getting these flood warnings_comma_ but they never happen when we're told it will.
Yea. When a flood is really gonna happen_comma_ none of us will even be prepared probably.
My dog nursed me back to health. She's such a sweetheart.
Yea_comma_ of course. She would cuddle me_comma_ and bring me whatever I needed_comma_ since I could barely move.
I don't have money to buy my brother a present.
Thank you. I'm going to cook him some wings. I hope he's not disappointed.
I was jobless but recently I found a job. I will be able pay my bills and avoid be evicted from my appartment.

I saw this little chihuahua tell off a parrot.
He was barking until the parrot shut up.
There's this guy that keeps wondering around my home the same time each day.
I will. Think I'll have to call nonemergency on him_comma_ if it happens again.
Last week when I was coming back to my home from office_comma_ a strange man approached me
I had a gun. I felt I was ready. If anything would have happened_comma_ I could have used it.
My daughter has been taking ballet since she was 2 - she's almost 16 now.
Well_comma_ she knows all the steps now_comma_ it's just a matter of working on perfecting them I guess.  She's very dedicated though and takes class 6 days a week.
My sister lost her job recently. I am trying to help her.
She get worried very quickly. So_comma_ she really need help and support.
A few days ago I took my personal training certification test. I really thought I did horribly_comma_ but today I got my results in the mail and I scored a 98%!
Thanks. I'm so stoked! I guess I shouldn't doubt myself; I did study pretty hard.
It sure does. I've always had a passion for fitness_comma_ so that helped out a lot too.
it was suprising to see lebron leave the cavs a second time
no its just that a superstar player left the team and then returned only to leave a second time  takes a lot of guts to do
I feel positive about my money making abilities no matter what happens in the next few months. 
I do both :) It's been a pretty terrible summer_comma_ and for me to feel this good now is a miracle but I know I can work my butt off
I went through a lot of trauma_comma_ I am getting older_comma_ I guess that is propelling me too hurry up and get it together as time moves on no matter what. I just want to be at my goals already and it takes only one thing..HARD work :)
I cursed in front of my grandmother the other day.
She was frowning_comma_ I am not proud that it happened.
Someone tried to steal the tailgate off of my truck last night.
He set my alarm off some how and then dropped it and ran
No_comma_ He made a clean get away.
Who knows. I hope not.
i hate when people think they can blatenly just flirt with your partner
he is attractive but the girl was as ugly on the outside as she was on the inside
i used to now it's just obnoxious
agreed.
A day before yesterday_comma_ my cat died
you are right. I was very very sorrowful and nostalgic that day. And even now
My best friend's mom has terminal lung cancer.
Yeah_comma_ it's hard to know how exactly to help her deal with this_comma_ so I just try to be there to listen.
it upset me to see my brother pulling up in a new BMW
nah cause he doesnt pay child support but he can go get stuff like this
my husband I are fixing my parents house.
yes it is_comma_ but we are helping it to look better everyday!
I in a plane last month and we hit a bunch of turbulance.  It was very unnerving and the plane was shaking a lot
Yes_comma_ I am not the best flyer anyway_comma_ so I really did not have a good time
I waited for my sister all day today. She was 6 hours late
I have no idea. I didn{t get to do anything I planned today because I had her kids. 
Well now I have to pack a bunch of stff into my sunday. no relaxing
I went to buy Legos for  my nephew the other day.
They are so pricey!  But it did remind me that my kids have way surpassed the Lego age - the years just fly by.
Have you ever seen tiger woods game?
The first time when I saw him playing_comma_ I was very influenced by his style!
We had some storming last weekend. It was pretty scary
No damage. There were some trees knocked down close to here though
When I was 18 years old and living on my own_comma_ my dad still helped me pay for half of a pickup truck so I could have a way to get around. I'm so thankful to him_comma_ because I still use this truck today_comma_ 12 years later!
I am too. It's gotten me every where I needed to go and rarely gave me trouble.
Definitely! I'll be sad when I retire it and buy a new one_comma_ which may be coming soon.
I was keeping my savings at home in safe. My house was recently robbed. The safe is gone also.
They were hidden their faces and wearing gloves. I don't think that the police will be to find them. I feel totally destroyed.
I am watching alpha dogs
Yeah about a kid who get kidnapped and they end up killing him. The actor is dead now too. I get sad watching this movie
It is sort of a suspense but it makes me sad lol
We are doing a lot of work on our house right now.
Well_comma_ we just started but we expect it to take a few years.  We want to move when the girls go to college if possible and get into a different neighborhood.
The traffic last night was nerve wracking. A lot of traffic and aggressive driving
Yeah it really was
i really miss my family. it's hard to be 800 miles away
it's really hard to do that in a one income household. 
they won't even bother there are too many of them and always say it's cheaper for you guys to just come down.
The new semester starts at the end of the month and I think I have bought all the supplies I need to be ready.
Yea_comma_ it's a bit stressful to get ready_comma_ but it goes smoothly once it begins I think.
Back in school_comma_ when I was playing soccer with my friends_comma_ I accidentally tackled my friend
He was very angry and I felt very guilty
I have a good feeling about tomorrow. I think its going to be fun
I am going to a cigar bar with friends
My sister in law makes me furious almost on a daily basis.
She cannot take care of her kids_comma_ yet has no problem going out shopping and spending every dime she makes on herself.
I get nostalgic when I think about this time of year. It makes me think of when I was younger
Just being a kid and doing fun summer things
i really enjoy keeping up with old family traditions i grew up with
going to the pumpkin patch_comma_ singing happy birthday at midnite on a person's birthday
it really helps to keep in touch with my family even though they are 800 miles away
4
I am sorry. I meant to say I was irritated by the weather this week. I wish the sun would come out
Yesterday I spilled some tea on my pants and it looked like I had an accident IN my pants.
Yeah it was. I was trying to hide behind desks for hours until it dried. Not a good day to be wearing khakis.
My friend got to play golf today. I wanted to_comma_ but I had to work
I was just envious of him
it seems like every other family in my daughter's class lives in a mansion.
Yeah_comma_ that's what I think every time I see them - it's hard to be myself around them.
i really love keeping up with old family traditions i grew up with
we would make a specific kind of stuffing for thanksgiving_comma_ we go to the pumpkin patch for halloween.
agreed. it helps me feel close to my family even when they are 800 miles away. 
My friend is moving away soon. I am pretty sad about it
A couple of states over
My father in law was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and I tried to help take care of him.
Well_comma_ I tried but it was really hard - we had to bring hospice in.  The people that work for hospice are some amazing helpers.
i really like the feeling of the unknown on christmas morning
i know right. my husband and i don't exchange gifts so it's mostly the childhood nostalgia memories
agreed. we don't wait for special occasions for gifts or celebrations.we just live our lives for today.
I'm feeling very happy about being able to go camping next weekend!
Yeah it's so fun but so hard to find time for. It's been a long time since I have done it.
It's going to be a local campground type of place_comma_ but I have never been to it before.
I did not get my paycheck cleared before the weekend. I was pretty mad at myself
I will have to be wise with money until monday I guess
My daughter just graduated from high school
Very much so! She has worked so hard.
My husband took our girls on a father-daddy day trip the other day.
They went to Six Flags - I had no idea how quiet it would be around the house with them gone.  I'm not so sure I liked it though.
i really want to see what my husband and i will accomplish by the end of the year
financially and personally
we are trying. i hope we can accomplish things together 
Back in school_comma_ my best friend got better grade than me. And it was an important subject
I have no idea_comma_ we studied all together. I was very envious on him.
I applied for my dream job but I never got a call back.
So do I_comma_ I saw a person who was having an interview right after me working there yesterday
I crashed my car yesterday
I'm fine but it was my dream car. I hate that I totalled it.
My friend got a new dog. Its my favorite breed_comma_ so I am a little envious

He lives a few hours away_comma_ maybe some other time
I had to have a medical test done about a month ago - all was fine but geez!
Yeah_comma_ and I had to wait 2 weeks for the results - it was so nerve-wracking!
I am so happy the houses in my neighborhood are far apart
They are fine. Its just quieter. I can't hear everything that goes on like in my old apartment
IT really is
I am looking forward to tomorrow. I am going to church with a friend
Its okay_comma_ it happens
My kids start school next week.
Nope_comma_ 2nd and 4th. We went and got all their supplies today.
I accidentally walked out with my drink in my hand at the store and forgot to pay for it.
I didnt' even realize it until I got home so I couldn't go back and pay for it. I felt terrible.
i was walking out of the bathroom at work after the person before me had really stunk up the place then i open the ddoor to find my boss waiting to used the bathroom
i think so just because i was the last one coming out of the bathroom. iwas mortified.
i could tell she was a little grossed out afterward
I have been jobless for 6 months now. Next week_comma_ I have five interviews. I hope to be hire in one of those positions
I am always trying to stay postive.

Oh_comma_ sorry. I was pulled into the manager's office a while back about_comma_ I was being offered a promotion. But the way they were talking about it_comma_ it was as if it would be kinda bad if I turned it down. it was kind of agonizing worrying about if i would get in trouble for turning down something that I felt I wasn't ready for.
Well_comma_ after about a day of debating it_comma_ I decided to turn it down and recommend someone who was more experienced for the position. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.

Yes_comma_ I am so shocked they did that!
I always feel anxious whenever  go to the movies.

I took a shower_comma_ I was so grossed out by it.
I got pulled over for speeding but there were cars passing me that didn't get stopped. I was fit to be tied.

I really took a trip down memory lane recently! I went to my 10 year high school reunion!
Yeah_comma_ and it really had me reminiscing about the good times I had in the past with my friends_comma_
The anniversary of my father's death recently passed. I'm still adjusting to things without him.
I agree_comma_ still it's all part of the life process so I try to cherish the memories and accept it.
I went online to pay my internet bill today and their payment system was offline. I was so let down.
I asked them about it_comma_ they said it would be back up later today...so not too bad.
I am going bungee jumping next weekend.  I am pretty nervous and do not know what to expect.
Or stupider.  I am not entirely sure.  I certainly do not feel brave about it.
Hi there! I had something pretty interesting happen recently. It made me really think about how much things have changed over the last couple of decades.
My parents gave me some boxes of some things that they have been storing at their house that were full of things from my childhood.
It truly seems that all my friends have a much better husband than I do.
He is one of those love is conditional people and it's so hard.
I have my birthday coming up next week and my co-workers are expecting me to throw a party at my house. I am so stressed about it as it will be my first time inviting them over
I hope everything will go as planned and i will not embarrass myself in front of them
When i go to work all my co workers always talk about other women even though they are all married. they always laugh at me when i say i don't care about other women because i love my wife
they just say that men can't be faithful_comma_ that all of us cheat and stuff like that. It's not true! I mean i really can't imagine cheating on my wife
The other day I had to go and get some legos for my nephew.  A very strange emotion kinda overcame me in the aisle at Target.
No just this feeling overcame me that my kids just have outgrown this time.
My husband and I got into a fight this morning.
He ust wouldn't listen to me and of course now he's mad about it and to punish me he didn't come to church.
I feel very optimistic about where my life is headed. The future is bright!
Nothing special_comma_ I just feel like everything is finally aligning and things are going in the right direction.
A few years ago_comma_ my dog ate rat poisoning on accident and ended up dying.
A few years ago my dog got into rat poisoning and ended up dying.

i was planning to go to work today and when i got closer to my car i noticed a snake. nope_comma_ not today. came back home and called off work today

My brother's wife told me not to come her house again for just no reason

I have no one to read with.
It would just be nice to have someone else around every once and awhile.
I cheated on my best friend.
Yes_comma_ we were on a diet together.. and I ate some bad food.
I left some food in the microwave on accident while I left my house to take a trip.
That's exactly what happened and I swore to never make the mistake again_comma_ as long as i can help it.
Olives are just gross to eat and look at.
All of them_comma_ need to disappear from this earth.
when I was a little kid_comma_ I sucked up a spider through a straw.  I guess it had been living in there.
Yep!  That moment sparked a lifelong hatred of spiders lol
People actually eat pizza?
None of it! People need to stay away from that stuff.
I have been exercising and dieting for the last year regularly! I feel really good about how I look and am really self assured!
That's no good!  Aren't you worried about your health!  You will feel better about yourself if you work out and eat healthy!
My dog ran away from home.
He is gone_comma_ i'm sure someone took him.
My dog got very sick the other day and had to go to the vet. 
He did_comma_ but my dog is my best friend and he had to stay a few nights away from home so I was upset.
Kids need to stay away from me_comma_ they are too loud!
I dont even want my own kids.
It was so relaxing and contenting to watch my kids play on the waterslide while I grilled yesterday.
Lol_comma_ yes you would have. We made hamburgers and brisket and chicken.
Do you not like chicken?
The first time I watched the movie "The Ring" I didn't want to go home to my empty apartment I was so scared.
Most definitely! I remember getting made fun of because of how scared I was.
It took a few months!
Yeah it did
I was watching a great movie last night_comma_ all snuggled up while drinking hot chocolate.
It was called Traffik. I just felt so relaxed.
I ate at a fancy restaurant the other night and the quality of the food was awful. So mad I paid that much for it.
That's very true. I hate being disappointed like that_comma_ but that's the gamble I guess.
I'm annoyed that many things are still closed on Sundays...like the federal reserve banking system.
Yes_comma_ we're now living in a 24/7 day world_comma_ and we need our systems to keep up with that.

I thought about getting rid of her!
My baby was up in the middle of the night last night_comma_ he's teething

I got a really good deal.  And I am splitting the cost with someone.  It is going to be a blast
Jesus will come home and save us all one day.

I get nostalgic thinking about my grandmother

Why does everyone else have nicer cloths than me?
I think they just have more money!
I was walking down the beach and this guy did a double backflip from just the ground. I was amazed
I was super impressed. He must have been a gymnast or something
My grandparents always gave me toys that I keep to this day.
Bears and trucks and things in between.

My husband forgot to let the dog back inside when I was at work.
He got attacked by a coyote and needs surgery.

I took it from them and they do not know bout it.
I woke up in the middle of the night yesterday thinking something had crawled on me.
Yea that stuff freaks me out but I turned the light on and couldn't find anything.
My brother has nicer shoes than me.
I would say they are Gucci.
I was very close to my mom and my grandma. they passed away a couple of years ago. I have so many great memories
that's true! They were both so funny and they loved to prank me and my brother. we had a wonderful childhood
I am so funny. People say I should go into comedy. They also say I might be the next Rodney Dangerfield!
He is probably one of the greatest comedians of all time. His signature phrase was "I don't get no respect"
I keep all of my pictures with my family.
I keep them online as to not lose them.
I started going back to the gym recently and I was so anxious the first day that I was going to look stupid!
It's good to be sore. It means you worked out hard.

My car has never been dirtier.
I wish someone one do it for me.
This Summer has seemed very short to me this year.
Yes_comma_ I love Fall and Winter the most.

It is always a good idea to make time for some "me" time.  It helps relax and clear your head.
I stole from my parents and they caught me. I felt so bad as they yell at me. 
I felt bad because I stole. I didn't even need the money I stole.

I am ashamed of myself for feeling that way toward him_comma_ but that is my emotional reaction and not much I can control it
I just started going to the gym but I felt apprehensive when I first started.

Yesterday_comma_ I think he is gone forever.

I stay away from the dark.
It makes me think of bad things.
Every time I clean my kids room they go in and mess it up again. I am so ticked off at them.
Well I don't understand why they can't keep their room clean. I tell them so many times!

It does_comma_ but I guess I'm also kinda used to it.  But I'm sitting there_comma_ just minding my own business_comma_ and this guy decides he's more important than anyone else.  And he flies up the emergency lane beside me_comma_ completely blocking any emergency vehicles that may need to use it.
I really like looking through old pictures. Its so nice to look back on the past. 
Yeah me too. I'm a historian so I love thinking about the past. 
Oh great. There was a big spider in my room_comma_ so I went to get something to scoop him up with (or flatten_comma_ I hadn't decided between the two yet). I come back and he's disappeared.

I totally agree. It's the only important thing sometimes.
I was so excited to see the new Star Wars movies but the really are a bit a of a let down

I agree one hundred percent! At the end of the day_comma_ being around my friends and family means a whole lot more than an extra 10k. 
I felt so dumb when I realized the shirt I was wearing was inside-out. I bet so many people noticed.
I usually pay better attention to my clothing. I must have been really distracted that morning.
My grandfather passed away over a year ago_comma_ and I was looking at some of the older photos I have of him and I as a kid.
I have a very bad memory_comma_ so you're right. The pictures really help me remember times I really enjoyed with my grandfather when I was young.
I felt guilty yesterday because I yelled at my kids..
They were being loud and obnoxious and not listening.
They are 3 and 5 so hopefully when they get older!
I was so upset when my dog chewed up the model airplane I was building. He thought it was a toy. Now I got to get a new one.

I am horrible at cooking_comma_ but I recently tried out a new recipe.
That is awesome! I was shocked to find my recipe came out pretty good!
Man sometimes I find myself at work just being frustrated over the fact that I know there is work available but I can't grasp it because pople aren't playing fair. you ever had that issues?
I can like for instance someone using an automated system when they claim to be selling items as "hand made"
It can be especially when your income depends on it! 
I have my final math exam tomorrow.
I did! I feel like I am going to crush it.
Part of my job is to clean up the bathrooms at the end of the night. Usually it's not so bad_comma_ but last night someone stuck so much toilet paper inside of the toilet that it overflowed EVERYWHERE.

I saw a dead dog on the side of the road.  It was not a good sight to see.  I felt bad that it was someones pet
I'm going off to college soon and I'll be leaving the small town that I grew up in. It's a pretty tough thing to do_comma_ I really love this place and have a strong attachment to it.
A little bit_comma_ but mostly excited. I do plan_comma_ if at all possible_comma_ to move back here or at least close enough to visit often. It's hard to let go for sure.

I saw a guy convince someone to give them there phone
nope i was very surprised by how good of a con man he was

I've began looking already_comma_ but it's going to be a very difficult transition and I doubt I will start out at the same pay. I'm at a loss for what to do... This is horrible.
I may have to suck it up and settle for a less expensive home and vehicle. At least I still have my health.
My dog didn't poop on the rug today.
He does! But he didn't today. I was so happy and proud.

I thought about that but I was thinking I would be honest and tell him what I did and why. Do you think I should?
Well_comma_ I think he is cheating on me so I took his spare I-phone that I suspect he is using to do it with! It is locked and I can't get in the phone to find the evidence.
You are right! I'm going to put my big girl underwear on and confront him! I will also tell him about the phone to gauge his reaction. Thanks for the advice!
my cat vomited on my rug today
nope but still annoying

I hope so! I have a feeling I'm going to be scared of the roller coasters_comma_ but I haven't ever been on one.
I went to a really scary haunted house recently! I have never been more scared!
It was completely black inside! The characters were so well hidden and jumped out from so many unseen places!
My top recommendation_comma_ is that if you have multiple kids_comma_ find a babysitter when you grocery shop.
Kids have a very finite amount of patience. And the more you bring_comma_ the longer it takes. Also_comma_ they wear each other down.
He's a good worker but not as reliable as I am. He is always calling in or not putting much effort into his work. I feel I should have gotten that position.
Thank you! Maybe I'll get another chance down the road but it still hurts a little. Has that ever happened to you?
I haven't talked to anyone about it not even my wife. Your words are definitely helping me a lot_comma_ thank you so much!

I talked to them but they weren't willing to waive the fee.
I moved to a rural area recently. At night I've been hearing all kinds of weird animal noises and I see large foot prints near my home in the morning. It's scary as all heck out here at night!

I don't even have any camping experience_comma_ so I was TOTALLY unprepared for this!
I went to a baseball game with my favorite team a few weeks ago. They had been doing pretty badly in the first half. Somehow they managed to pull it together and win in the end! That made me very happy!
Yeah it was much more exciting than if it was easy. I'm sure the other team felt excitment in the opposite way too.
I'm getting married in two months. I'm so excited_comma_ but admittedly a little nervous too. I think about it all the time.
There's so much to plan for and so much to think about! And congratulations on ten years of marriage! I hope my marriage is as successful. You give me hope.
I do! I think she's on top of things too. At least_comma_ I hope she is!
My older sister is always comparing our children.
Yes it is upsetting_comma_ because she alludes to her children being smarter and more well-rounded than mine.
I have not had a conversation with her about it. However_comma_ I know she does it on purpose just to get on my nerves. She has a history of getting enjoyment out of messing with me and now my kids.
My dog got out and I haven't found her yet
I'm not sure. She's probably around the neighborhood somewhere_comma_ but I haven't found her yet. I hope she's ok

I love the Dallas Cowboys!
Yes_comma_ they are the best.  I am optimistic they will do well this season.
I am having a hard time with someone who keeps repeating the same mistakes.
Bad behaviors and attitudes. It's hard to see they keep going back to the same path.
Well therapy will_comma_ I hope! Thank you
I used Youtube to fix my fridge.
I'm so glad we have Youtube nowadays. So much money saved.
Someone spread rumor about my hubby.
Yeah_comma_ but I didn't believe them. he loves me more than anyone in this world. 
Yesterday while swimming at my moms pool in the backyard_comma_ my toddler took her bottle of tanning oil and unscrewed the cap and poured it all over the lanai. I was so mad_comma_ that stuff is not cheap and can stain things easily.

That's true_comma_ but they've all been high school sweethearts. So it's unlikely. I wish I found someone back then
My friend of 4 years ended last weekend.

I want to be healthier! And look better_comma_ too.

a dark wooded area
I am feeling a bit of trepidation about today actually.
Yes_comma_  My partner was being a bit rude and he can explode easy_comma_ so it's hard.
Yes_comma_ it is hard_comma_ thankfully he does have a reason..a mental illness and he is working on it- but it's still hard for me. I hope you have peace now!
I got an award for being employee of the month.
A small amount of money... which is better than nothing.
Hey I'll take it.  Thanks :)
I could not get my lawn mower to work. 
Sorry *I cannot get it to work. No_comma_ I can't afford that really. I have to order a bunch of parts now and it's a bummer! I would have someone come mow it for a quick 20 but they don't show up.
Lawn mowers seem to require a lot of maintenance_comma_ like a car. Worth it I guess as I don't have $300 for a new one. Ha! Expensive

I'll get over it.  I might not hear the end of it for a long time though.
Girl I asked out said "no"
No. Just asked her out on a date.

I had to work. It was some kind of event he was going to as well
My Grandma made me a big pot of her homemade potato salad yesterday! 
Yes it should last me for a few days.  I am so grateful_comma_ it's hard for me to have time to cook during the work week. I LOVE it when others cook for me!
I'm so stoked_comma_ I just got into the film school of my dreams.
I know I am beyond thrilled. I've been wanting to go for years.
It's a three year program. 
I have a new sweet dog who was abused and her little puppy.

No_comma_ my partner isn't here anymore. I live alone_comma_...except for furkids :) But everytime I felt that way..I remembered the bad times and I didn't feel so bad about living alone.
True! Thank you! They do for sure. It's hard to be without a partner but truly it's better then being abused.
I went to the beach for the first time since I was pretty young_comma_ and the smell of the seawater triggered a lot of memories. I didn't find this out until I got back home that memories are sometimes really closely tied to scents.
It's the first time I've ever experienced it! Oh_comma_ and the beach was really nice_comma_ too.
My granddad and some of the family were on one of those deep sea fishing boats. I was too young to catch anything_comma_ but I remember thinking it was really fun.
Tired of people going 50-60 down my side street.
15...As in any city. There are kids and animals here and the police never do anything about these wreckless drivers.
Yes_comma_ because 1 person including kids get hit here daily and this is a SMALL city...They complain about having no money here..but they would get a TON of money if they would ticket these terrible drivers that can and DO kill others daily.
I got woken up today by the sound of my phone going off. I haaate the sound of phones_comma_ they really stress me out for some reason.
I answered the phone and it was just a bill collector for someone who isn't even me. I tried to go back to bed but I was already annoyed.
i hate seeing homeless people 
yes it has been getting bad lately
I am so disgusted at my neighbor who flooded my apartment from above. I will make him to pay for the whole renovation 
Apparently_comma_ after having a shower_comma_ he forgot to close the water flow. That seemed to me to be a truly stupid excuse
Dealing with a partner away at therapy is tough.
He....He has a lot of childhood issues. Very abusive childhood and has given him a lot of mental health issue.
I know right..They were horrible..beatings..calling him names..having him hold down their autistic brother to beat him..ENCOURAGING them to be mean and cruel to any form of "weakness" etc...He has so many problems from it and definitely RE-ENACTS it with me..I can't do that anymore..No abuse and dysfunction allowed here..So I am hoping this helps him more.
i was pissed when i saw a dent in my car door
someone in the parking lot
I got a thank you note from a co-worker.".
Thanks_comma_ it was pretty nice to get some recognigtion.
Yep_comma_ my bosses sure don't do it.
my neighbor has a dog that wont shutup
i didn't know i could do that
i was scared to walk home alone the other day
i live in a dark wooded area
i was impressed when i saw lebron leave the cavs a second time
that he had the stones to do it a second time
sure
I slept in this morning. I was more than okay with it
It was a nice feeling
This weekend_comma_ my friends and I are heading out to the casino. I'm gonna try to bring home more money than I left with this time!
I've been a few times. You're supposed to treat it like entertainment (ie you shouldn't mind losing your money if you go because it's more about the fun aspect) but forget that_comma_ I want the jackpot! Haha
i felt bad when i couldnt get my daughter the gift she wanted
yea thats true
My friend won the lottery_comma_ wasn't expecting it.
A quarter million.
I was waiting to hear back on a loan so I can buy a car. Everything should be ok but I am getting nervous waiting on it.
I did. The loan officer was very kind but they seemed to be taking forever.
i loved taking care of my sisters pet
a bearded dragon
It sure has been a low slow Monday.
It's mostly me. I'm just not really here today.
I wound up on the floor at Panera Bread not too long ago.
LOL Definitely slippery me! New medication with fun side effects.
My daughter made us late on the first day of school
she went back to sleep when she was supposed to be getting ready
I am going to get one because I really dont like being late lol
it was horrible seeing a dog get hit by a car the other day
yea he ran a little afterwards and then just went down.. it was sad
Someone stole my trash can.
The city will literally give you one for free.  I don't even get it.  
Yep.  The lack of integrity of some people is shocking.
A little pain goes a long way.
I saw someone playing an entire song by themselves at a talent show once.
It was very well done actually_comma_ they won the show.
i was pissed when i saw someone had put a dent in my door
nah it was at a grocery store
I tried a keto pizza I bought yesterday and it was awful.
Lol- Some keto things are fantastic! But this...It tastes like a THICK corn flour tortilla. Just really gross! Sad as it cost a pretty penny even on clearance
I am on KETO so I need to try KETO things.
I was up most of the night again.
I have a new mom who is quite obsessive with her baby and she keeps accidentally sitting on him and making him squeal_comma_ so I had to get up a lot and move hime
Yes..but even humans don't have it right a lot_comma_ so not all animals do either. If I move him away from her she screams all night..so I guess I won't get much sleep for awhile lol
I just took the bar exam this morning.
Yes and I am so excited. I know I did well.
I got a random box of diapers the other day_comma_ the size and brand that my son wears. It was just delivered to my house and had no return address or anything. I don't know who sent them but it was very nice of them!
I have no idea_comma_ I asked anyone I thought might have done it but everyone said it wasn't them.
i was pissed when i saw a dent in my car door
no i did not.
I hope I will get a raise after my training
The training is very hard!
Thank you!
We just got back home from shopping! It was so much fun. 
Clothes_comma_ shoes_comma_ and babygirl got some toys! It was so much fun. 
i was scared to walk home last night
it was about 2 am.. in a dark wooded area
I had a project i was working on and my boss had some questions... if i told him the truth i could possibly get fired so i lied.
I was too scared to lose my job and i didn't see a way out of this situation
A bit upset I was up all night again_comma_ not my dogs fault so much as she is just a new momma.
Just one_comma_ abused dog and she had one 2 weeks after I got her. I was planning on getting her fixed soon- so it's good we found out ahead of time. Yes she is quite neurotic about it. So it's alot. I hear you..I don't sleep much anyway sometimes so not always the biggest deal
i was disappointed when i couldnt go home
had to stay at work to finish what i had on my desk
A girl asked me out
I was just "um"ing the whole time and walked away. I feel so stupid.
My favorite steak and cheese place is closing down
Probably within next month. I look forward to grabbing a sub from there everyday after work.
We had a huge storm the other day and it was extremely loud_comma_ very dark. 
Thankfully yes and you are right it was quite scary at the moment! 
I'm graduating in the Winter and already have a job lined up
It's ok. I'm just happy I won't have to job search for the time being.
i loved taking care of my sisters pet
bearded dragon
I was pretty lost when my died dad a few years ago. I felt scared the time
Yeah it was a dark time for sure
Gonna hit the buffet after work. It's gonna be good!
Oh no_comma_ I hope she's just sick! Are you taking her to the vet?
I miss my dog every time I see a dog
Yes. They both did. 1 year apart.
i was pissed when i saw a dent in my car door
about 6-8 inches
yea and color scratched off
My 2 year old was such a good girl today out and I am very proud of her!
Yes I am because I was dreading even going out with her as she usually gets fussy real quick. 
I was pretty happy this weekend. I got to go kayaking with friends
No it was my first time going actually
After 8 years of dating_comma_ we're getting married.
Thank you! I'm really happy and hopeful for what's ahead of us.
i was scared to walk home alone last week
everyone left me behind
I have a presentation soon. I always get nervous talking in front of people
Not at all. Worse case scenario_comma_ I hopefully just read off my paper.
I feel so blessed these days to just be alive in general. 
I think a lot of people take it for granted and dont realize its a blessing to even be able to wake up. 
i cant wait for next week!
kids go back to school
My friend bought a audi R8 last week. I am happy for him but however i kind of feel something inside
Haha_comma_ I am!!  and also wondering how did he managed to buy that
I was on a date and apparently had a booger hanging out the whole time.
It was. Wish she would've told me!
So I went out shopping the other day get home all excited to use my new shampoo and............. cant find it. 
The cashier forgot to spin the thing around_comma_ and I never grabbed it off from that bagging cart. ugh 
No one's at the office. Never been alone here before.
ABout 6 years now.
I felt pretty good going to the gym this morning. I had a plan of what I wanted to workout and it worked
I try to every weekday morning
I helped my neighbor mow her lawn. I barely have the energy to mow my own.
Yea. She's elderly_comma_ so I think most people would help.
i felt bad when i couldnt get the gift my daughter wanted
yea she will get over it in a few days
I am so happy. I made an A in all three of my summer classes. I have never done that before.
I couldnt believe what I was capable of. I plan on doing it again this semester.
At work_comma_ I'm one of the only men around so I tend to take out the heavier trash. Tdoay_comma_ the trash bag busted all over me. It was so gross_comma_ and I was choking on that sickly sweet trash smell.
Sort of. I would for a university food service umbrella group thing_comma_ but when I'm at different locations that I have to bounce between I'll take out their trash since they're understaffed.
I was so proud of my oldest son. He finished 6th grade on the A honor roll.
Oh yeah especially the math!
Same! i have to use calculators all the time for easy caluclations.
I got a letter in the mail today from a friend. It was a nice shock for me
It had been a few months at least
When i see beggars on the road side. I feel pity on them and i just want to do something for them
i always do as i feel so sad for them
i was angry when i saw someone had put a dent in my car door
nope.. gone without a trace.
i was mad when i saw someone put a dent in my car door
no i didnt see anyone when i got back to my car
Last week i had my bachelor party. It happened in a location i least expected it
Children's park. It got me surprised
My cat got spooked by something and jumped over my half wall that I had a candle sitting on top of_comma_ and knocked the burning candle onto the ground shattering the glass everywhere and liquid wax flew all over. I dont even know how Im going to clean this up!
Got any ideas on how to clean the wax?
I applied to a few jobs_comma_ and I was interviewed for the one I was most interested in. I haven't heard back from them though_comma_ so I don't think I got the jobl
That seems like a long shot_comma_ but it's a good idea. I'll at least try it_comma_ thanks.
i was a little sad when i couldnt get off from work last week
fly flishing
My tattoo artist really made my tattoo pop. I trust him now more than ever
He retouched it and just went over it
My nephews came over a few days ago and it reminded me of my good childhood days.
Yeah it's fun to think back to when we were so carefree and had so much energy towards everything.
My kids start school next week.
We are all ready and have all the supplies. They can't wait.
i felt bad when i couldnt get off of work on time
to go to my sons game
I am so thankful to have a roof over my head_comma_ and food to eat. Its been rough lately but life is good. 
Yes it is it truly is! Its a beautiful feeling! :) 
i was scared walking home last night
had to walk down a path in a dark wooded area
I was walking down the road earlier today and saw someone throw a bunch of rubbish out of their window.
I didn't think to. I don't understand why people do it though...
I'm getting a raise and a promotion in Feb.
Yes_comma_ I've been working towards it for a year.
i was excited when i got approved for my vacation
Las Vegas!
i was crushed when i saw someone had taken my lunch from the fridge at work
no i did not
I hate it when the gym is so very full..
I had to work during that time!
I love my job. I have been with the same company for several years.
I get regular promotions and I am very pleased with the way things are going.
I didn't receive a cashback offer on purchasing the item.
Yeah. I contacted them but they aren't responding.
When my brother was suspended from high school awhile back_comma_ it made me sick
He was accused of something he did not do
i loved taking care of my sisters pet
bearded dragon
I like to be prepared for a bit trip beforehand.
Make a list of what to pack mostly.
I almost hit a dog running down the road last night. It was pretty scary
It was a black dog_comma_ I am not sure
I was so late for work and trying to drive fast to get there.
My alarm clock didn't wake me..
i loved taking care of my sisters pet
thats cool
i trusting with my friend
yea man
it is very fun
I'm really glad I have the family I do.
It does. They have been lifesavers!
Can't believe he marked me wrong on that test.
I studied for a week_comma_ it was my final exam.
I'm going to try_comma_ I know some of these answers were correct.
My sister just put on a halloween mask and jumped in the window! I jumped out of my seat.
It was the most realistic werewolf mask I've ever seen!
I think I'm going to have to!
i was happy when i got approved for a vacation
a week
I can't wait to eat my sub.
It's called Banh Mi. It's a Vietnamese sub sandwich.
Didn't mean to break his glass but I totally did.
It was a mug his father gave him_comma_ I was playing with my dog and I knocked it over.
I hope so_comma_ I feel quite regretful about it.
I'm afraid to check my messages. The last line I saw from my friend is "we broke up"
I will tonight. For now_comma_ I just want to brace myself.
I got approved to adopt a dog!
Oh I already picked one! I'll be picking her up this weekend.
i felt all alone the other day
nah the kids went to go stay with their grandparents for the weekend
I found out the other day that my sister is pregnant.
Its a good thing. She and her husband have been trying for a baby for the last year or so_comma_ so they are very excited.
My youngest daughter has a cold. 
It's not that bad_comma_ she's just resting in bed.
i was crushed when i didnt get approved for a day off last week
yes its very busy right now with all the kids returning to school
My friend's wife got into an accident. She can't walk anymore_comma_ and he's still with her 20 years later since then.
It sure is rare. Happy to be this guy's friend.
I'm working hard to pay off all my debts.
School loans and my house. Got behind and used credit cards.
Just got accepted to my dream school_comma_ Yale!
thank you! i'm going to be studying business.
My brother graduated a few years ago_comma_ and now he's ready to buy a home
It sure does. I can still remember changing his diapers.
My boss tasked my coworkers and I each with an individual project and whoever did the best would get a promotion. My coworker blew us all out of the water with her project. I only wish I had her skill...
I don't know_comma_ I felt like I tried pretty hard and poured my heart into my project and still didn't come close. It kind of feels unfair. Maybe she's juts naturally better than I am.
I guess you're right. I should try and channel this energy into something positive and become the best that I can_comma_ even if my best isn't as good as she is.
I'm changing careers. Going to cooking school.
hahaha thank you! I sure hope so!
i was upset when i saw someone had dented my door
yea it sucks
The weekend went by so fast.
A little_comma_ but it all felt so short. I'm in favor of the three day weekend.
I already work 16 hours a day.
My friend bought me a $400 knife
Oh wow. It is hard to find nice friends nowadays.
I cant wait for my trip next week!
its las vegas. i love being around all the excitement one mine and all the depression the next :)
Im so ready waiting for my package to arrive today. 
I am waiting on a fitness machine to come. 
My girlfriend will be working abroad for 4 years. She's the only female in her team.
I'm extremely nervous but gotta trust her. She's never done anyting to make me doubt our relationship.
I've been putting in a lot of work teaching my dog how to run an obstacle course. Yesterday he did amazing; he broke his old speed and wasn't distracted a single time while doing the course!
Right at two months_comma_ I'd say. Was hard work but totally fun at the same time!
Going to dog shows is absolutely fantastic. You should check one out one day.
I forgot my lunch and my wallet at home this morning.
Yeah_comma_ I had someone give me a little thing of ramen noodles from his desk.  I'll manage until I get home.
Yeah_comma_ I used to keep a bunch of stuff ilke that in my desk drawer but_comma_ I've gotten lazy and haven't been back to the store in a while.
I let my health insurance coverage lapse and don't have any insurance right now. Figured I'd be okay since I'm young and haven't gotten sick or hurt in years. Just yesterday_comma_ someone smacked into me and my leg hurts a ton now.
You're probably right. Although it's the first year I'm off my parent's insurance plan_comma_ so I didn't really start the process of looking into them and learning more about them like I should have. When you're young_comma_ you just assume you're invincible_comma_ especially since I'm a nerd who stays inside most of the time. We'll see how it goes.
Im feeling pretty bad right now. I cheated on my math final. 
It wasnt anything too major. I wrote a few formulas down so I would not forget them. Still kind of crummy though.
I am so ready for my first day at my new job. I went out and bought all new outfits. 
It is! Great to be ready to roll. 
It feels great having a girlfriend who puts her trust in you that you wouldn't do anything to hurt her. My current girlfriend_comma_ unlike my ex_comma_ has no problems with me going out with my friends occasionally.
It's very refreshing. I'm just happy that we have this trust in one another_comma_ I feel it will go a long way to making our relationship strong.
Quite possibly! She's amazing_comma_ to be honest.
Her name is Claire.
Can't believe mom got me a puppy!
I am so happy_comma_ she's a husky girl! Has beautiful blue eyes.
Just sent out some applications for my dream schools.
Harvard and Yale_comma_ I'm nervous.
I hope so_comma_ I plan to study law.
i am hoping to get next week off form work
i wanna go to vegas to go gamble a little 
I spilled coffee all over my new shorts the other day. 
No and I had just got the shorts. :( 
This parrot can hold full conversations. Only problem is it keeps calling its owner fat while he's eating
It flirts with girls. I guess it depends on the owner. I think this dude told his parrot to shame him_comma_ so he'll lose weight.
My mom_comma_ who's in her 60s_comma_ lost her best friend today_comma_ who passed away. She was one of the only friends my mother had_comma_ and I feel sad for her since she lost a connection to her childhood and past. She seems really lonely.
Yeah_comma_ just doesn't feel like there's much to offer her. I'm also not living close_comma_ so I can only have phone conversations with her_comma_ which_comma_ again_comma_ doesn't offer much. She's a good person_comma_ so I hate to see her so bent out of shape
Just had to dissect a frog.
I don't like hurting animals so it felt wrong to me.
I've been married forever. I'm good with it.
Sonia
I lost my lucky pen.
I lost it yesterday. But having it for 3 years.
I got a bonus the other day at work and felt so blessed. 
Thanks it really made me feel great. 
My boyfriend and I did a cooking class for dater night.
We make chicken parmesan with home made pasta. He got the best student award!
It was I told him he has to cook once a week now
i knew i shouldnt have trusted my brother with my dog
he ran away
While commuting to office today_comma_ one man stared at me.
He stared at me weird. Once i noticed him_comma_ I became unease.
I'm looking to move! Just put an offer in on a place_comma_ looking forward for a positive result
You bet! I think it's time to have a place I can really call my own. Hope they say yes!
My wife was sick the other day. so I spent the day taking care of her.
Yeah_comma_ she had a pretty bad cold_comma_ but it was nothing major.
i went into that interview knowing everythng they threw at me
yes i got the job
I'm expecting a raise in Feb.
It'll be around 25%.
I exercise often but as a powerlifter I do very little cardio and never really had much interest in it. A friend of mine introduced me to marathon running and wow_comma_ I like it much more than I anticipated!
It's really nice! Definitely can't compare to powerlifting_comma_ but it's enjoyable nonetheless and it's healthy.
Sure will. I plan on continuing both as long as the cardio doesn't interfere with my strength levels.
Hi_comma_ I couldn't get the food to feed my family_comma_ so I just stole some of the more expensive things from the store.
I have 5 different kids and they all want food_comma_ what should I do?
Thanks_comma_ I will try the number.
I left my adult son home for a few days and just came back to a sink full of gross old dishes! 
Yes_comma_ I did. The whole house is a mess. He's going to have to spend the day cleaning!
i shouldnt have trusted by brother to take care of my dog
he is missing
I have to put a dresser together later.
I am sure I can do it well.
My life is going great right now.
No and there is nothing that I would want to change.
I was listening to an old burned CD I found from the early 2000's. It brought back a lot of memories from that time.
I remember be being back in high school listening to some of those songs. 
It was really hard to say goodbye to everyone at the end of the family reunion. It had been so long since we were all together.
No_comma_ it was last weekend. I was so happy to see all of my relatives and then before you know it it's time to leave. What a range of emotions.
I anxious about my tomorrow's exam.
Nope. I afraid to go tomorrow.
My Pet parrot died yesterday.
I don't think so.  They're quite a bit of responsibility. I'd like freedom to travel etc.
That too. Thanks.  I'm sure I'll be fine.
My dad just started college again!
He's 45 and just going back now_comma_ to start his business degree.
At night_comma_ my neighbors dog keeps barking and barking and I have no idea why. I've avoided bringing it up to him_comma_ but I'm trying to avoid drama.
It's a little terrier_comma_ but man can that thing bark! I don't know how my neighbor doesn't hear him.
If it doesn't stop soon_comma_ I'll have to find  a way to politely bring it up. I can't take it anymore.
Can't believe I failed that test.
It was calculus_comma_ very hard stuff for me.
It's quite hard but I plan to really tackle the next test and ace it.
I have a family reunion to go to in about two weeks. I'm so stoked. There are a lot of family members I haven't seen in a while and I'd love to catch up with.
I'd say so_comma_ yeah. So it's going to be a ton of fun.
Sure will. One of our family members is a DJ and so he'll be playing there.
I have a business meeting today.
No_comma_ I am nervous because there is a mean person that will be there!
I'm gonna!
You should be a counselor_comma_ thank you!
I just had a huge test that I was supposed to pass. I bragged to everyone that I would_comma_ but I don't think I did.
I spent so much time talking about studying and didn't really study that well. I think I'm gonna have to inquire about the grade_comma_ it's eating me up inside!
I had a speech I had to deliver at work in front of a big prospective client.
 I studied and memorized the speech for weeks and went over it thoroughly. When it came time to deliver the speech_comma_ I nailed it!
My girlfriend and I recently broke up.  It's hard being in a house by myself all the time
I used to be really good at being by myself_comma_ but I got so used to having someone around that it's weird for me now
The new Warcraft expansion comes out today.
Yes it is.  Its the most popular one of its type.
I've played on and off for a long time.   As far as entertainment for $ spent_comma_ its a great deal.
Haha_comma_ maybe its a pool you don't want to dip your toe into.
I just thought of this crazy time when I had a wardrobe malfunction of my own. Have you ever had one?
You're lucky! It's the worst!
Probably not! I managed to show everyone my underwear by mistake. I've never had that happen when buying a car. What kind of car did you get?
That's cool! My first car was a Firebird. They're so much fun but lousy on gas.
I just bought a new car and it looks great and drives smooth.
Yes I did it has a lot of issues but I think that it is worth it to fix up.
Ford mustang it is a fun car to drive. Do you do a lot of your car repair jobs yourself?
Yeah it is actually pretty easy and all that is neccessary is just watching yotube videos on it. I was surprised.
i was pissed to see a dent in my car door the other day
someone hit it at the grocery store
I had the nicest surprise last week!
I wish! It was my birthday and a friend surprised me with a cake! 
Not as good as a lotto win_comma_ but delicious for sure! 
i loved taking care of my sisters pet
a bearded dragon
Got a bag of candy I'm polishing off. Diabetes be damned
I haven't gotten a physical in over a year.
I asked my friend to get some stuff for a party_comma_ I knew I could count on him though.
I understand_comma_ I'm a bit introverted myself_comma_ it gets easier the more you do it though.
Was able to pick up an additional scholarship to help with college tuition for this upcoming semester.. I guess any little bit helps_comma_ considering how much student loan debt I'm already in.
Yeah_comma_ it's kind of disgusting to see. Like_comma_ they send out emails every now and then to break it down what you have in loans so far... and it's not so fun to see the tens of thousands of dollars of debt just peeking at me from around the corner when I finally graduate.
I am so upset with my friend's new "relationship"
Well_comma_ she met a man online. He says he's going to marry her when he comes home from the Army but in the meantime_comma_ he's always asking her to send money to him. 
That's what I tried to tell her! I think she's being catfished. She ends up sending him money that she really needs herself.
My girlfriend lost a lot of weight.
I totally am but also afraid that other people are hitting on her now.
I wa thinking about putting in for a transfer at my job
It actually both. I would moved to another city and get a raise. I dont know if  I should though
Yes and I wouldnt know anyone
Just a few more hours until the work shift is over
Oh hey_comma_ we on the same time clock.
I walked around for half the day with my pants unzipped before I realized it.
I mean nice? Just normal boxers.   It could have been worse 
Yeah_comma_  Not *that* bad.   Still though....
I went to visit my sister who goes to college_comma_ and we ate at a soul food/southern style place. It was so crowded and loud_comma_ but when we sat down to order I was really surprised.  The food was really good_comma_ and super cheap for the portions we got.
It was really good! I'm not going back to Alabama any time soon_comma_ but if I did I'd be compelled to stop by there again.
There is a new puppy in my home.
Yup. My husband brought it as a surprise.
I lost my friend's dog.
I've been searching all night. I'm on hold right now with the local shelter.
It has been so tough ever since I moved away from home. 
No_comma_ no one. It's hard meeting new people. 
It's lonesome sometimes. I'm trying to get out more though!
My brother and his wife just had his first baby_comma_ I am over the moon for them!
It was a boy_comma_ the named him Ralph.  It suits him somehow.
Not much_comma_ I've got to spoil my own kids and I can barely afford that.
My car has worked in months and now school has started
No. The school is close. But there are like 5 hills. I hate it lol
I think I might enroll her in daycare justs for the ride to school
We just lost everything in our basement in a flood. We had torrential rain all week long..
I don't have money to hire help.  My husband and I are trying to clear it out ourselves but we lost a lot of stuff_comma_ even part of our business was down there.
I've been taking care of my youngest daughter today. She has a cold.
She hates soup_comma_ so no. But she's resting nicely.
Yeah_comma_ and I'm the Dad.
This Starbucks I used to go to had horrible service--so I would always be ready with a free drink or sandwich in mind in case they forgot my order.  Worked every time lol
This one did eventually.
I felt bad for my friend. They were going through hard times so I bought them dinner
It was something new and sudden
I am deep cleaning my kitchen as fall arrives and wow_comma_ I pulled out my fridge and found this caked black dust bunnies and grease gunk.
Yeah_comma_ I'm still trying to tackle it but it kind of makes me want to gag.
I recently got promoted at work.
I am_comma_ I super excited to start in my new position!
I glad to see my daughter as a dancer.
folk dancer and she won a medal in that too.
My daughter fell on the sidewalk yesterday and skinned her knee pretty bad.
Yeah_comma_ after a couple of hours of bandaging and pampering she started to feel better.
I hear gun shots last night when I was sleeping. I felt pretty scared
I live in an okay neighborhood_comma_ that is what was so unsettling
When I feel a bunch of eyes on me in a room full of people it never really fazes me.  Especially if they're mostly cute girls and I just got a clean fade
A haircut.
I miss getting my nails done
I can't afford it. I get upset when I see cute nails now.
I don't like charity I do like nails though
I saw one of my friends play in his rec basketball league and did very well.
Yeah they do have tournaments_comma_ but the game that I watched was a regular season game. They ended up winning
Not in a league like that just recreationally with friends. I am not good.
A while back_comma_ I had a car accident and it broke my ankle. I've recovered since then_comma_ but I've never been able to walk around like I used to. Last week I did my longest walk since the accident though_comma_ so I feel really good about that.
Thanks! It's weird because I never really wanted to run or anything before_comma_ but when I realized I might never be able to really run like I used to could_comma_ it really bummed me out.
I felt pretty interested after hearing someone speak at my church yesterday. They knew what they were talking about
It was mostly talking about being charitable
So proud of my friend for making the hockey team.
It's a major junior team in Canada.
He really is_comma_ hoping to make the NHL some day.
My daughter just had her first piano lesson today.
I really am.  I have been listening to her practicing for the last couple of hours.  She is better than I thought she would be after one lesson.
I felt pretty good going to meet my friends for beers last night. I almost felt cocky
Guy friends for the most part
When I see a bunch of cute girls dancing at the club I try not to start hitting on all of them at the same time...I wait til the one who's been dancing the craziest and most sensual finishes dancing then I start chatting her up after
...what
Every time.
Haters gonna hate hahaha
The burrito I baught from the vending machine was expired.
I have to put a post it note on the vending machine and the guy will call my desk next time he stocks the machine.
It does not :(  Stuck eating snacks. 
When we went grocery shopping the other night some girl starting talking to my husband_comma_ giggling_comma_ and all that. He tried to be polite_comma_ but_comma_ she just wouldn't sto[p and I got so mad.
I just finally cracked a joke about us needing to get to the grandkids party. 
It was funny actually. My hubby was so embarrassed because she was just too extra lol.
My kids are now officially gone to college and my husband is away on a 4 day business trip. Its so quiet.
Ha ha.  I was thinking about getting a dog.  What kind do you have?  Oh_comma_ so you know exactly how I'm feeling.
I've been waiting all day for this maintenance guy to come. They guaranteed me he would come within this 3-hour window_comma_ and that it would be today. Looks like it'll be neither. Love wasting time!
It's for internet. Not much I can do in terms of calling other people to come. They just gave me some standard excuse_comma_ and told me that they'd be there at some point soon. I wish there was more selection for ISPs!
My youngest sister has her learner's permit so I've been trying to teach her how to drive. You don't know true terror until you're in the passenger's seat of a 16 year old's car
Oh heck_comma_ I can just barely parallel park. I'm dreading teaching my sister that one_comma_ oh boy..
My dad loved this time of year. So it makes me think of him and miss him
He passed away a little over 3 years ago
I put in some applications to rent out my local park for a reunion with my cousins and such. I think I got a great deal.
Yeah it's going to be a great time. I hope the permit comes back soon but I'm not worried at all. Should be fast.
I just found the most honest car mechanic.
I will.  I told him what I thought was wrong and it would have cost me $2000_comma_ but he got me out for $20.  It was amazing.
I get off work in 45 minutes. I can't wait.
Tell me about it. I'm dying to get home.
I wish_comma_ Managment's not gonna let that slide_comma_ eventhough they do it themselves.
Amen_comma_ I know.  "do as I say_comma_ not as I do"
I had a high hopes for my son. But he fails to reach it.
18 years old. He didn't pass in his final exams.
My in-laws just suddenly showed up yesterday and said they were staying for the week. I had no warning at all but I guess they were trying to make it fun_comma_ ha ha.
Not really_comma_ but my husband is going to try to get some time off if he can.  Its hard in the summer since so many other people at his work have planned vacations. I did have a heart attck and ran around like a crazy person cleaning upstairs before they came up.
There's this tree outside of my apartment bedroom window_comma_ and sometimes when the wind blows just right_comma_ it taps against the window and startles me.
It's not my tree to cut down_comma_ unfortunately. I'd at least like to prunce it a bit; the silouette it makes at night looks a lot like a person outside my window.
I graudated with a chemistry degree this year.
Get a job. We've got a pretty big chemical plant complex near by so_comma_ hopefully i'll get a job there.
Someone at work threw my lunch away today.
Nothing_comma_ I just had to pay all my bills_comma_ and I don't get paid until tomorrow_comma_ so I was just out of luck.
I did_comma_ I knew who it was because they've been whining about wanting to clean out the fridge_comma_ but they didn't check what was old and what was new.  So irritating.
Sometimes my boyfriend cooks_comma_ and the food tastes pretty gross
No_comma_ he's seriously trying. I eat it because I love him but I should really send him to a cooking class_comma_ haha
Wildfire blew a lot of smoke over our city_comma_ it was hard to see on the road
I hope so too_comma_ the sky is so gloomy and it's hard to see traffic. Dangerous to drive right now.
My manager at work told me that I should expect good news soon and to meet him in his office tomorrow when I come in for work. I'm expecting it to be about a promotion I've been eagerly waiting for.
Thanks! I'm not 100% sure it is a promotion_comma_ but I'm keeping my fingers crossed!
You're right about that. If he wouldn't have added the "good" part_comma_ I'd be a nervous wreck! 
I homeschool and am used to schooling one child but now I started 2 kids in school this year and I'm not sure if I'll be able to juggle it well.
For some things they both can work independently so I'm trying to pair those subjects up and then do some subjects together with both of them.  I hope I'm doing well enough!
I was extremely angry on my dog.
He spoiled my garden. It became mess.
Once at a swimming competition_comma_ I had a wardrobe malfunction in front of a lot of people
I ran to the dressing room as fast as possible. At least I placed 3rd? Haha
Yeah_comma_ I didn't realize till I got out of the water
I went to a buffet the other day and they kicked me out for eating too much.
The crazy part is I'm a vegan_comma_ but I had like 20 salads.  I guess it was too much! hahahaha.
Yeah_comma_ I was pretty embarrassed. 
I got a spot bonus at work today.
Being reasonably competent_comma_ unlike most of my co-workers.
Its kind of a burden. I way too much time fixing their mistakes.
You don't know true terror until the thought enters your head_comma_ "My kids are being exceptionally quiet today..."
It's never good. Best case scenario_comma_ one room of your house will look like a bomb went off. Otherwise_comma_ mud_comma_ food_comma_ drink_comma_ poop will be anywhere/everywhere. FEAR!
i took my pharmacy tech certification test last week_comma_ but almost wasnt able to because i couldnt afford the $200 fee for the test. my aunt heard and reached out and paid it for me as a gift.
i did very well i was prepared. i was thinking id have to wait a couple months for the next session. but good thing i was able to get it out of the way
I took my son to the lake the other day_comma_ and we ended up skipping rocks. I don't know why people skip rocks; it's not really fun or anything_comma_ but we did it. It reminded me of my grandfather and I when I was a kid_comma_ and we'd do the same thing.
Yeah_comma_ I hope so. You never really know what kind of moments someone is going to remember. I remember all sorts of things that weren't really important_comma_ but I guess they were important to me at the time.
One more month and I get to go on a vacation to the beach! Its been 5 years so I'm chomping at the bit! Yay!
Outer Banks_comma_ North Carolina.  I love that area!  We'll be in Corolla.
I know_comma_ for years I've been hearing my friends and family going without me and felt the same way.  I finally saved up enough money and got it when it was much cheaper.
I am pretty happy we are taking a trip at the end of the month. I am going to need it
We are going back home to Louisiana to see friends and family
I love rain. i'm sitting on the balcony and enjoying the sound and the smell of the rain_comma_ so relaxing
I don't sleep at all lol i have a little baby who wakes up every couple of hours_comma_ but i do love to sleep listening to the rain
I dropped my phone in the toilet last night and now it's not functioning right. I also didn't have insurance on it which is a huge bummer_comma_ because this phone was expensive!
It's actually in a bag of rice right now. I'm trying not to get my hopes up though_comma_ I'm bummed out enough as is.
I dropped a bowl of mashed potatoes and it smashed all over the floor
Thanks_comma_ you're so sweet. It was fine_comma_ my boyfriend helped me clean it up.
Fried chicken! My favorite dish of all time.
i'm preparing to run a marathon. i'm not a runner and never participated in any race but i think i can do it!
i've been training for the past 4 months and i already signed up and paid for this marathon so i have no choice lol
work transferred me to a new city. its nice so far but i dont know a single person
i know.its just that initial breaking in phase. have to meet new people and see what is around my new city
I'm expecting a good score in my exams.
Yeah and I did exams well.
I don't really have much direction in my life right now_comma_ I'm just trying to keep my head above water because I don't really have any other option.
I've asked pretty much everyone in my family for help_comma_ and it seems the answer from all of them is that they can't afford it financially right now.
Yeah_comma_ I've applied for government assistance_comma_ but haven't received an answer. I think I will try GoFundMe soon.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting I had a technical issue. I just got a new deep fryer_comma_ and I fried my very first turkey today. I know it doesn't seem like much_comma_ but I am very excited about it.
Thank you for understanding. It's been annoying my family but I bet they're excited for me as well. I love frying birds that's for sure haha.
Three of my friends are due to have babies and I still haven't been able to get pregnant. I don't understand how they get pregnant so easily and nothing is wrong with me.
I'm on my 5th cycle of invitro.  Did she have a baby?
Congratulations to her!  That gives me hope.  You hear so many kinds of stories.  That sounds like such fun!  I don't be telling my mom either until we're ready. ha ha.
I'm looking forward to going home and relaxing on the couch.
You bet.  That's the plan.
That sounds awesome. I hope you have a good night.
My son peed on me the other night.
I know!  Both of my kids are completely out of it when they wake up in the middle of the night_comma_ so I went to help him and he peed on me.
Can't believe my friend made the team and I did not.
Hockey team_comma_ I did my best and it wasn't enough.
It's okay_comma_ I did my best_comma_ maybe next time.
My nephew came over today and I noticed he was wearing an outfit that I had given to my sister years ago when my own son grew out of it. It reminded me of the times when my son was still a toddler. 
He's 14 now. So it was some time ago! I held onto the clothes until I found out my sister was having a boy. Brings back so many memories seeing the outfit on my nephew.
We are. We're a pretty tight knit family. It's pretty common for us to pass around clothes to one another too_comma_ just to help out.
Hello! I just got a new neighbor who seems very nice. I have to leave town for a bit_comma_ and they offered to watch after my pets. I'm going out on a limb doing this but I've accepted their offer.
Yeah the convenience is certainly weighing heavily on my decision making_comma_ but they seemed nice and they have pets of their own. I hope it works out.
One time I cried at work because I was really stressed about a project
Aww_comma_ yeah sometimes our emotions are hard to control
I like to volunteer at the local animal shelter
Thanks_comma_ I really like cats_comma_ so it's fun for me too
My parents went to abroad.
London_comma_ for business need. So my sister is taking care of me and home.
I have to go to jury duty later this week. I am real nervous about it
I have gone way back in the day_comma_ I honestly don't remember what happened
I had to go to the hospital last month when i got really sick and I was charged 400 dollars more than they said it would be. I am ticked off to say the least.
I didn't even agree to half the tests that they ran.  It gets my blood boiling and yes_comma_ it's so stressful.  I usually avoid going at all cost.
I got told on short notice that I've got a bunch of people coming over to eat dinner. I just got back from the store and I'm ready to do this!
At first I was really nervous about it_comma_ but I'm in a groove now and I just hope they're satisfied. Bring it on_comma_ I say.
I certainly do_comma_ which makes it easier for sure.
My Husky was out in my backyard thats been her yard for over 2 years now and she randomly jumped over the 4ft chain link fence. I had no idea that was possible but she saw a stupid duck and I guess needed to chase after it.
Well the area behind my fence is a big grassy area with a pond and its really mostly closed off by other peoples fences that come together in the back_comma_ so yeah I was able to get her with a couple pieces of bacon. Lol
I just started learning to rock climb at a local indoor climbing facility near me and finally got to the top of the tallest wall!
I have struggled with chronic pain for over 13 years and almost died from my autoimmune condition.  I decided I would fight and work my way to do things I would never do.  This was one of them.
I lied to my mom.
I had 2 ice creams. But lied that I didn't have any. Since she scold me.
I have to take a foreign language for college this semester. I'm not really looking forward to it because I feel like I'm going to embarrass myself trying to speak the language in front of everyone when we have to talk
Yeah_comma_ I don't know if it's just my specific college's requirement or what.. I can see it being useful in my major since I'll have to interact with people in my profession_comma_ and some of them could be foreign. It's still nerve-wracking.
I'm looking forward to the upcoming weekend.
I think I'll go swimming.
Really not looking forward to taking my public speech class in college this semester. I feel like I'm going to get up there and vomit all over myself. Last time I had to talk in front of a group of people_comma_ I was so nervous_comma_ people were laughing because my knees were visibly shaking.
The best I can do is incorporate humor into my speeches so that I feel like it's taking some weight off of me. But then there will be times where no one laughs at my jokes..
My cat sat on my bag right after she came out of her litter box_comma_ gross
It's true_comma_ she doesn't listen to a thing I say_comma_ but I just love her so much_comma_ she has such a sassy personality
I cant wait to go on vacation this week. Its all I can think about right now.
I am going to the beach. I cant wait to be with all of my friends out there.
My daughter needed a computer for school and we were trying to figure out what to get her that would make it all the way through college.
We did a lot of research - and then my dad just up and gave her a Surface Pro - complete with keyboard_comma_ the MS Office suite_comma_ pen_comma_ case_comma_ everything!
I've been doing a ton of research and I think I'm finally going to take the first steps to begin investing in the stock market and try my hand at day trading.
It's a very complex subject_comma_ but I think I've gained a solid understanding of the ins and outs. I guess I won't know if the research paid off until I try!
Well thanks_comma_ that means a lot to me!
I'm long-distance with my girlfriend right now_comma_ where she lives almost 1_comma_000 miles away. I live on the east coast_comma_ she lives in the midwest. She has a good job_comma_ and I'll just be graduating college_comma_ so she's established. She's determined that I need to move to her_comma_ but I don't feel great about the idea.
Nah_comma_ wasn't a surprise. We've been long distance for like six years. But she does have a lot of logic on her side.. She has a good job. But I feel like I'm closer with my family_comma_ and that the east coast is nicer to live near. I just don't really want to move_comma_ is all
I'm an aspiring actor and I have yet to land any large roles. I feel like I've been doing well and I've been at this for at least two years now.
I've always been on the mind set of going after your dreams rather than living a life of autonomy. But I can't say that I'm not a little let down so far and questioning my choice. I guess I need to look at the long term_comma_ two years isn't that long for something like this.
I was able to go buy a dog bed today and a few others things I needed/wanted.
I haven't always been able to do that. It's nice to be able to get stuff when you are all set with bills and making a comfortable income. I know right?
This time of year takes me back to when I was a kid. I always looked forward to football with my dad
Memories are always nice to have
Have to do a long road trip tomorrow to visit an ailing family member_comma_ but the scary part is it's set to be thunderstorming for a big stretch of the drive. I've never done well driving in the rain
Yeah_comma_ I'll do my best. Just don't want my anxiety to get in the way of being able to focus. Plus I'm just not wild about the idea of having to be on edge the entire 8 hours I'm driving. Hopefully the weather changes at some point during the drive
I received a hike in my salary.
Yeah. It makes me surprised.
Summer is almost over.
I think that I will as soon as the weather starts to change.
Have to get a high mark on this exam.
I have been but it's feeling quite nervous about it_comma_ it's a huge test.
I smoked a cigarette today_comma_ after two months with out smoking. I feel bad.
Just stress from work and financial struggles_comma_ but I should of dealt with it in a different way.
i felt so good when I babysat my friends cat.
They're the most cute_comma_ my friends are on their way to europe.
Last night I stopped at a gas station on the way home from work just to grab a snack and while I was there the place was robbed at gun point.
I'm a little shaken up_comma_ but I think I'll be okay. Especially because no one was hurt during the robbery.
I did_comma_ that was the scary part! I was in the back of the store and I watched it all unfold. I secretly dialed 911.
my brother bought the car i had my eye on.
yeah he did. but in all fairness he had the cash first. i still needed to come up with the rest of the money.
I'm jealous with people that have gyms in their homes. 
That's true_comma_ I should look up some tutorials on youtube. I need to get back in shape!
Dude cut me off in traffic turning left in too a store..had to slam on my brakes.. then had the nerve to beep back at me. 
I know_comma_ I am- They do it here a lot_comma_ you have to be very careful. By the way there was NO one behind me for a mile. ARG!
I have a dentist appointment next week.
Me neither. I do not want to go.
I'm really stressed that I'll have enough money to cover the bills this month. 
Yeah_comma_ the struggle is real! I might have to take out a loan!
I do_comma_ but I would rather not bother them.
Super happy to have a new puppy in the house. 
Not sure yet. Mom is a tiny pitbull. No idea who the father was :( It's been a VERY long time since I have taken care of a newborn puppy!
Tomorrow's an exciting day for my family. We're sending our two youngest children to a new school!
It's a charter school. That means that it is public_comma_ but that they focus more on academic and a classic education. Less common core.
Amen!
I bought my partner some socks today.
Yes he works hard at his job and he lives in socks and shoes- so both are important.
He does various things for a roofing company. Works long hours. 
Sometimes I watch ahead on a tv show if there's a cliffhanger. I should wait to watch it with my boyfriend but I don't haha
Oh well that's just spoiling it for herself haha. 
So happy I got my momma dog a new bed today.
Lol- cats are picky- Here I have a bunch of animals so someone will always like it. She won't leave her cage though and stays curled around her puppy all day and the blankets I have weren't cutting it so she seems more comfortable now- She is in a cage because she feels safer- she was trying to bite other animals.
My dogs are just not picky. And they never leave you alone lol! I do have one dog that chews any dog bed or blanket though :( Sigh- Lab mix! He is a handful and a half.
I broke my son's favorite toy. we were playing and i accidentaly fell on it... he was crying so much i feel horrible
i don't think so. My wife brought it from another country when she was travelling for work. i'll try to search for it online
I'm pretty upset I got a flat on the way to work today.
Right? I was late and I'm down 200 dollars_comma_ but at least I still have my job.
my new 2018 subaru WRX is going to be delivered today!! i CANT WAIT!!
it is so much fun! 
Proud of my son for scoring two goals in his soccer game this weekend!
Yeah it was_comma_ He is turning out to be really athletic.  Must have gotten that from my wife's side_comma_ haha.
 My mom was arrested as a kid. It brought shame on me and my family
I am trying so
I knew it was going to be sunny today. I had a good feeling
I did have that_comma_ and I was right
I was happy to go on a trip for my birthday
To Vancouver to see a drag show_comma_ it was such a fun time
Mom's going to be mad_comma_ I stole some dinosaur toys
I hope so.
I do it was a mistake_comma_ I'll do my best to never do it again.
So i'm sitting here relaxing and IRS calls me telling me if i don't pay them 3000$ they will arrest me!
I hung up lol it's a scam. IRS never calls they send mail. these people tried to threaten me :)
At work_comma_ a new coworker keep looking at me in weird way. I feel very uncomfortable.
I don't know. I don't want to make problems for nothing. He is a very weird guy.
It was a bit of a rough weekend. 
Partner is working hard at therapy most days but he isn't even close to being okay yet. I just don't know if I could ever trust him again.
I've recently started volunteering at a homeless shelter. I have to say it is one of the most rewarding decisions I have ever made in life.
We help make sure they are well fed and have a warm place to sleep. We also get to spend  a lot of time socializing with them as well. Some of the sweetest people in the world. Makes it difficult to imagine what could have caused their situation.
Oh wow_comma_ that boils my blood! I don't understand why it's so difficult to allow these types of things to continue.
Exactly. While some people quite possibly have brought it on themselves_comma_ to assume that all or even most have_comma_ is nothing short of ignorant and hateful.
I got my mom some temporary teeth.
A long time. Moldable plastic with no dangerous chemicals. It's quite interesting. It's not expensive to get a big bag of it. It is insanely expensive to get one tooth put in_comma_ so this should help her until then.
$800 bucks a tooth...From a car accident- Car insurance...FULL coverage does not cover that...it's insane.
I was given a promotion at work today.
Thanks I sure did. It's about time!
I'm excited to play the new World of Warcraft expansion today!
I have it on my other screen_comma_ I'm ready! It should be really fun!
Yeah_comma_ 4 years!
Im a little disappointed. I just got the call that the job I wanted went with someone else. 
I dont know. Never met the person. Its going to be hard to find another job like that one.
So I am getting second thoughts about going on my trip. I am leaving for two months but I am getting nervous about going.
I am going all over Europe. The thought of being in a foreign countries for so long is kind of scary. Not sure if I should go.
I really like a new perfume that I've tried but it's so expensive I don't know if I should get it
yeah maybe_comma_ I've been checking for it at discount stores. Perfume is one of the most marked up items though_comma_ not sure if it's worth it
I'm really hoping I enjoy this new World of Warcraft expansion as much as I've been excepting to!
I've been Horde all my life_comma_ but I might try Alliance this time.
My manager has taken my coworker for a work trip to New York. I was also suppose to go with them.
I don't understand why I didn't go. He said that will take both of us and then one week before going he have changed his mind. He told that he doesn't have enough money. 
Once I saw 2 men playing basketball and one of them hit a long range 3 pointer
No it was a pickup game but the one who it the shot is playing college basketball. Hopefully he can get me some tickets 
A manager I do not like was working at the store I love today. \
Yes! It can make it a bit uncomfortable to shop there. It's the only one of it's kind in my area! So it's a bummer! 
I've been weight lifting for 6 years now and I can finally say I'm very proud of my physique! I'm 30 years old and look better now than I did at 20!
Oh absolutely! Weight lifting has amazing health benefits. Studies show that even starting at the age of 80 will improve overall well being by a lot!
It's a huge confident booster too. The positives creep into all aspects of life.
I keep seeing a poor little black kitty running around outside every night. 
 He won't come near me and my house can't hold another cat. I will feed him though. I have big dogs_comma_ so not sure if he'd come near my house :( I will try though!
Oh_comma_ I would never! I am just so beyond full with the same type! lol- And cats don't like to be packed in. I have seperate areas for my nice cats and mean cats and it's still a touchy balance! If I had a bigger house_comma_ I would help even more. They are so innocent! Our local AC doesn't do cats and I wouldn't want him pts anyway but I will always feed animals in need
Me either- don't ever move to california..So many little dogs pts daily..I would become a total hoarder lol. It's just insanity! I am already there with lots of rescues in my little house. I want to do a farm rescue too- I feel fulfilled when I help innocent animals.
I'm surprised with how clean the house was after I came home from my trip. My wife is the best!
Yeah_comma_ I hate messy places_comma_ I'm OCD and it drives me nuts
I recently got a new job in a city three hours away in an industry that I've never worked in yet. I'm a bit nervous_comma_ but at the same time I'm excited.
Thanks for confidence. Yeah_comma_ it's all overwhelming. The new job in a new industry and the move away from the town I grew up in. But I'm ready to take it head on!
She went in for a kiss but I declined.
I'm already with a girl_comma_ couldn't do it.
I try my best_comma_ I really do love her.
Okay_comma_ this is going to be a weird question_comma_ but did you guys ever have any Yo-yo sales people come to your school as a kid?
Why were they allowed to just come to the school? I remember they sold really expensive yo-yos of all things_comma_ and I got so excited because they made them look so fun_comma_ so I saved up my money and bought one and low and behold.. it was just a yoyo.
I just went a job interview. I feel it went really well. I really wish that I get it.
Its a Financial analyst position with a really great company.
I'm jealous with people who have a washer and dryer. Going to the laundromat stinks!
It's such a hassle_comma_ would be nice just to walk into the other room and do it!
I work from home
I do. My daughter has been talkong t me for abot 20 minutes. She knows that I'm not lisstening. yet she continues
I know! I can't wait untile she gets a job so I can go and talk her face off
I'm happy when I eat gourmet ice cream_comma_ but it's so expensive
I've definitely gained weight this summer from eating so much ice cream haha
I'm so grateful for video games_comma_ they have brought so much joy to my life in stressful moments in life.
Haven't heard of that one_comma_ I'll have to check it out.  Right now_comma_ I'm really enjoying Monster Hunter.
I have pretty bad social anxiety. Today while I was paying for my groceries_comma_ my anxiety acted up and I ended up giving the cashier the wrong amount of money TWICE. I felt like just running out of there!
Not at this one_comma_ unfortunately. I made myself look like I can't even do basic math_comma_ when it was just my anxiety acting up.
I apologized profusely. Probably enough to make myself seem even MORE awkward than I already seemed. Ugh_comma_ I need to stop thinking about it.
I am feeling good about my money making skills.
I work from home :) I am powering through and working on normal work then working on my business the rest of the hours in my day.
I'm pretty good right now in life_comma_ couldn't ask for anything more. I'm very low maintenance.
Yes_comma_ I'm very grateful for my family and friends.  I don't know how I would live without them.
Our new baby newborn pup here is getting bigger everyday!
Pitbull mix? Won't know until he is older :) I didn't know if he would make it_comma_ so it's really sweet and happy to see!
People are the bad ones. Dogs are fine :)
It's nice listening to old music.
Lots of old pop and punk songs_comma_ like a day to remember!
It really is_comma_ I'm cruising along the highway jamming out right now.
My youngest children are starting in a new school tomorrow_comma_ and I'm kind of nervous.
Them_comma_ easily_comma_ but that's what I'm anxious about. I'm expecting a phone call while I'm relaxing in my lounge chair that my kids are begging me to pick them up!
Here's hoping!
I'm so tired of being abused.
My girlfriend_comma_ she is talking to other guys now.

A couple months ago my 60 inch element LED HDTV randomly got white lines all over it while my fiance was at work. I didn't do anything to it at all_comma_ it just glitched up by itself and got worse as the night went on. I don't think it can be fixed.

I've started working with a lathe and I made this wooden cup with it. That doesn't sound like much but using a lathe is so hard! So everything I drink out of it tastes that much better_comma_ haha.
Do you know how you spin clay on a pottery wheel to make rounded shapes? A lathe is sort of the opposite_comma_ it rotates a piece of wood and you use instruments to shave or carve out pieces of it. You know those rounded parts of bedstands? That'd be the kind of thing you might use a lathe to make. Or baseball bats_comma_ ect.
I feel like the Eagles can win the Superbowl this year_comma_ I am not sure though

I usually just rely on the alarm
Ever go back and watch old movies?
I was watching old disney movies_comma_ made me nostalgic.
Someone asked me how me and my fiance met the other day and it had been awhile since I had even thought about it because it was over 8 years ago. While I was telling them about it I got that feeling you get when your remembering something_comma_ almost like adrenaline but in a calm way.

My sister is a hooligan I swear.
She plays pranks on me constantly is the issue.

Yeah_comma_ it was the orthodontist but my teeth are so straight and pretty now_comma_ it sure was painful and hard to put faith in someone over 5 years of surgeries and appliances in my mouth and all that jazz. I remember asking everytime_comma_ is this really going to be worth it?

Yeah_comma_ I was so embarrassed by it_comma_ even though I know how she got it.  We had to tell the mission trip group leader so that they could notify the rest of the group.  Overall 8 of the 10 girls that went got it.
Found a nice cooking channel on Youtube. I think its time I ascended from ramen
Definitely. Ramen will still have a special place in my heart though.
I have an ongoing bet going on with my friend that ends next week.  I am sure I am going to win_comma_.
It is funny to say_comma_ but it is a beard growing contest.  
My daughter graduated high school with a 4.0 GPA.
Yes I was and I don't want to say that I was shocked_comma_ but I know it's not easy to accomplish.
Had a laptop put on hold at a store. Drove at least 1 hour for it_comma_ and it turns out the employee sold it.
I could only leave a review. Nothing more than that.
I was heartbroken when my grandmother passed away_comma_ I could not handle that at all
I am_comma_ but it still stings_comma_ you know how that is
I couldn't go to dinner with my friends on time. So I ended up having dinner by myself.
That's ok. Yea_comma_ I hope next time as well!
I was heartbroken when my grandmother passed away_comma_ I could not handle that at all
I believe she had just turned 60
I don't know how chefs push out food so fast. It takes me an hour to make a meal.

Man this weekend is going to be SCARY
Going to the amusement park and going to try and ride the coasters!

I just watched the movie I saw with my wife on our first date.
While you were sleeping.  It is one of our favorites to this day.
I'm never usually home by myself_comma_ but a few weeks ago I was.  There were these men running up and down our street just screaming and yelling.
That's basically what it was_comma_ some sort of domestic issue.  The police came and arrested both of them_comma_ but you'd better believe I had all my doors bolted and all the outside flood lights on!
I was doing important work and my laptop died_comma_ even though I had it plugged in. Lost some of the work. Ridiculous.
Yes_comma_ it was about 3.5 hours lost.  I didn't know whether to scream or cry. ha ha.  Technology can be so good and so mean too!
We were late for the first day of school
I know. I stayed up too late with sunday tv
We all have to get back into the swing of school
I'm going on a blind date this weekend.
Yea. I don't know what to expect!
I am still shocked that Eli Manning didn't retire from football.

Too many kids and bills. no time or money
I was feeling bad about my son's activity.
Yeah_comma_ he scold me to cook well.
There's a 60 year old in one of my computer programming classes
I know. Most of us really admire him_comma_ but the professor was being really demeaning!
Im redoing my toddlers play room into more of a 'big boy' play room rather then a baby play room and Im really excited for him to see it. Hes going to be so happy.
He will be 3 in January_comma_ and Im trying to combine potty training with this so he feels like a big boy and will start acting like it. Lol
I eat a lot but don't get fat.
Maybe so. Although I don't get fat_comma_ it doens't mean I'm healthy. I'm just glad I don't have to worry about weight.
My mother's husband had alzheimers and went downhill really fast after the diagnosis.

I am_comma_  but I have to attribute most of it to my wife putting up with me for so long.  She is a saint!
There have been a series of breakins in our neighborhood recently.  We've turned on all our flood lights hoping to dissuade them from coming here.

Man I feel so bad about last weekend :/
I went to the bar and forgot to tip my waitress
Yeah she's there all the time.  My tab was pretty high and I was drunk.  I just forgot to put down an amount in the tip area.  Next time I see her there I'll float her some cash.
I lost my Grandpa 2 months ago. He died within a week all of a sudden and I miss him every day.

Times are tough but with my family_comma_ life is good.

Sometimes I get sad watching true crime shows
It terrible what some people do to others.

I see so many dudes hitting on my friend's girlfriend.
Yea. I think that's very disrespectful of them. Yea. She's real eye catching.

My dog died this time last year
I'm glad I had the time with her that I did.

My dad and I were talking about the past_comma_ just reminiscing a bit. I'm going to miss these times.
Mostly just my childhood and some of his.  His mind is going quickly_comma_ there won't be too many more conversations like that.
I can't wait for Friday to get here!
Yes_comma_ I'm going tubing down some rapids.  I love doing it every year and its supposed to me sunny and clear!
I cheated on my math test the other day. I felt pretty rotten about it.
I haven't yet - you're the first that I've told. I have a feeling I won't be able to sleep tonight.
My cat ran away and had been missing for over a week.
I did and then we discovered she had been ran over.

Its been a week and every day I am picking up their trash of the stairs

My friends are in the process of adopting a child through DFACS.  It's been going on for so long though!
No domestically.  It's been a pretty nerve-wracking adventure for everyone.
I told my friend that a guy didn't like her. I like him so I didn't want her to go after him. I feed bad though because he might have a thing for her.
I guess to make things right_comma_ I'll find out and if he says he does like her_comma_ I'll just do what's right and try to get them together.  If we're not meant to be then we're not meant to be.
I am currently in the process of building a computer.
No_comma_ but I am sure it will be easy.
I love my husband. We have been married for 22 yrs.
Well it is my second marriage.. but hey at least its a long one.

Its monday nigiht and my neighbors are having a freaking party
They are the worst
My work life makes me so stressed out due to work load. And I have no one to come home and receive emotional support from. Being lonely is the worst
I am not a believer in therapy sessions. They have temporary effects but cost much. The only solution is get into relationship. I hope to find that someone special
My oldest daughter is graduating high school this spring.

My neighbor in my duplex is still up at this hour doing some kind of sanding and sawing! I asked him to stop and he won't! 
He's my landlord's father-in-law_comma_ oddly enough.  I have let him know in the past and will let him know at a good hour.  Next time I'll just call him in the middle of the night and tell him its happening.  Its like he's an insomniac.

It's all the way across country from where I used to live!
It was for my work! :)
I spilled my coffee in the middle of a busy coffee shop. It was horrible!

My daughter went on a mission trip to an area that is really depressed.  She brought something extra back home with her though.
Lice - she brought back LICE!  I was so embarrassed by it_comma_ even though I knew she'd gotten it from the children she went to serve.  Of course then I was sad for those kids not having anyone take care of that for them.
I can't believe the content they post these days.
On youtube actually_comma_ the old videos were much better.
I stole candy from the store when I was a kid. I still think of it to this day.

My sister has been dating this guy for about 7 years and I wish she would drop him.
Yeah_comma_ he's a bum!  He mooches off of her_comma_ she works and he sits home and drinks.1
Scrolling through old photos of me and my partner_comma_ i understand how much of a mistake I have made to let her go
It has a been a year since our split. I think she has already moved on with her life without me. And I am still trying to move on
I was so scared going to sleep when I was a kid. I thought the monsters under the bed were going to nab me!
I know! I am still somewhat afraid too sleep alone to this day. I don't want them to snatch me up!
My kid broke my watch today...I was so mad!
He is but a toddler. I wasn't mad at him for too long because I really shouldn't have let it out for him to play with in the first place.
Man. This weekend might be fun.  But it also might be SCARY
haha no!   Taking my neice and nephew to the amusement park!  
No I wish!  I've never ridden a roller coaster EVER!!!
I lost the money pouch for the deposit at my job the other day.

I've been volunteering at the animal shelter as much as I can lately
I really enjoy it too_comma_ I love getting to take car of all the dogs and cats.
I am expecting a time sensitive package_comma_ but the tracking for the package has been all wrong!
It was supposed to be a birthday gift for my best friend_comma_ so I may have to tell them about all of this. I'm nervous!
My boss said that I was rude to a customer earlier this year and that is why I am not getting a raise.
I tried but he is a real turd.  He doesn't listen to anything his employees say.  The problem is that it is out of his hands because the customer complained to corporate.  It was a total lie_comma_ but they don't care.
So my dog is super spoiled.  I think she'd let us feed her with a spoon if we would comply. But the other day she did something I was shocked by.
Well_comma_ she saved our cat from near death by allowing the cat to fall on top ofher when the cat fell off the banister.  Stupid cat.
I went to the park and read a book yesterday. 
Oh it was! It was my first day off in so long. Everything felt right in the world.

No but it's just a hassle to take time and go pick it up... I wish the delivery guy would have knocked
I was so scared to go into my apartment building the other night. I saw so many roaches the night before!
I didn't see any on the way in_comma_ but I know they are still lurking out there!
I was coming home from work and there was a lizard by my door. It moved and that was all she wrote. I am scared to death of crawling creatures.
I wouldn't be talking to you if it had. I would still be laying flat out.
My son had all A's last year at school.

Yeah_comma_ they are saying that I will be the head lifeguard for next season.  I have never been so pumped.
I ate 10 pizzas all by myself last night.
Oh_comma_ at the time I thought I was equivalent to Zeus himself. Then the morning came and I felt like yung_comma_ powerless_comma_ baby Hercules. It was dreadful.
I had made a bad mistake on a work project_comma_ and my coworker took the blame for it. I felt bad for not speaking up to my boss.
I apologized to them later about it. It was tough hearing our boss scolding them about it though.
I ate 10 pizzas last night. I never felt so bad about myself.
I did! I satisfied it_comma_ but I never felt so shameful...
My father in law's heart surgery is next week

I have my final math exam tomorrow. Never felt so prepared in my life!
It is! It's my final exam for the semester too!
I know how much of a chore full-time employment is. What are you doing now?
I'm trying to do the whole work-from-home and be-your-own-boss thing. That contentment doesn't last long! Where have you sailed?
Oh? I don't understand the difference between serving on a ship and being deployed. What is it?
My dog ran away yesterday. I've never been so distraught in my life!
I have! And no one has turned him in. I do hope he finds his way home on his own.
My son said his first word today!
He said "money"! I couldn't believe my ears!

My lawn mower was broken and my neighbor fixed it.
Yeah_comma_ I am so thankful for him!
My son said his first word today!
I know! He said "alfredo"! How zany is that! 
I went to Panera Bread for dinner earlier.
No_comma_ just eating.  I was quite pleased with the meal!
I am feeling extra guilty about not sticking to my diet. I ate so much fried foods and a whole ice cream sundae by myself!
Yeah_comma_ I just feel so bad about it. I was trying to stay disciplined and good about my diet.
I went to the park and read a book today.
I was reading my favorite_comma_ A Catcher in the Rye. It was so nice having a day off and doing what I enjoy.
I ate 12 pizzas all by myself today. Never felt so bad about myself.

i think she did. It must have been smelly. She smirked her face once
My parents threw me a surprise party today!
They gave me a bunch of presents and doritos! I was so stunned!
I am really getting irritated with the traffic nowadays
indeed that's how it is now!! and horn sounds are just terrible. It gets on my nerves
Dangit!  They burned!!
YES!  LOL.  My brownies!!  All that time mixing and preparing wasted! 
I like the taste of home baked goods though.  Fresh from the oven.  YUM.  Now they're just black!
I saw someone blow their nose into their shirt.
No_comma_ I think the person had mental issues.  It was beyond gross.
I ate 20 Big Macs for dinner tonight.
It was indeed! While I was consuming them. Then I looked back and thought about the starving kids in Antarctica...boy did I feel ashamed.
Only about 3 weeks to go!
Going on vacation!!!!
We're going to Panama City!!  Wooot!  Taking the kids to the beach!
Someone lit a bag of poop on fire on my neighbors sidewalk last halloween.  The smell of it is something I won't soon forget.
I know.  I didn't even know that was something people really did_comma_ I thought it was just in the movies...Gross!
My son said his first word today!
It was indeed! His first word was "pistachio"!
I have my job interview today. I am quite hopeful that it is going to go well.
Me too! I really want to be the first millionaire that works at McDonalds!
My wife is  off to her Mom's for couple of days
yeah but i think i am going to miss her and feel alone
My dog pooped on the rug today.
Well_comma_ it won't be an issue anymore. I put it up for adoption. This was the last straw!
Seeing Republicans clearly and directly rejecting notion of climate change makes me terrified of our future as a species
Despite having overwhelming consensus among the climate scientists that human activity is causing it_comma_ they are still turning faces. Totally unacceptable for politicians 
I saw a man drink an entire gallon of chocolate milk.
He did! I was very inspired by the act!
No it was a friend of mine_comma_ I wish I could do that.
Every time I am promised a promotion they give it to someone else.  It just happened again!
It is really irritating.  It makes me think I need to go find a new company.
Thank you.
There was an internet outage for hours today_comma_ the day I decide to stay home because I don't feel well. What a day.
Yeah true_comma_ that would've been worst

It did_comma_ fortunately. But I am starting to get so fed up with his antics!

I'm not sure...he's been acting up the past few years. I wish I knew why. I've never been so disappointed in him.
There is a fly in my room and it is annoying the heck out of me!
Yeah_comma_ right? And it seems like they don't have an off button_comma_ they just fly around non-stop!
I was so happy france won the world cup. I was just so happy that England didn't.

Thanks! I am just going to a bar with some close friends. I do hope they get me a cake!
The cafe down the street used to be my favorite place to eat.
They are not completely shut down yet_comma_ but they have recently failed several health inspections.
I just can't stand it anymore. My partner nags almost about every detail of our relationship. Just yesterday_comma_ she criticized my taste for clothing
I did many times. She doesn't seem to understand or even consider my concerns. I think we will not go any further with such attitudes
My best friend moved away to another city.
Yes_comma_ I am so sad she's leaving!
I am getting married next year
Thank you but i am hopeful my future wife won't cheat on me
I just bought a battery pack charger for my car_comma_ and guess what happened to me today.
My battery died_comma_ but I was able to just step out_comma_ hook up the pack to the battery_comma_ and in 5 minutes I was on my way to my meeting.
My girlfriend always tells me what to do.

I just got a huge raise at work.
It is!  The owner of the company just decided to sell the company and he negotiated a raise and promotion for me before he left.  It was so kind of him.
I forgot what I was saying during my speech at work.
No_comma_ I felt so humiliated.
No_comma_ not for a while.
I let out a moist_comma_ warm fart today in front of all of my co-workers today.
Some ran away in terror. Others in disgust. I think I sent one to the ER even. At any rate_comma_ I was mortified and I am sure I won't ever live this tragedy down.
My new semester starts next week and I think it will be my best one yet.

They opened up this really cool toy store about a block from my house.
I got some scented gel pens and a few of those pens where you can change to different ink colors. Also_comma_ a few books for my nephew! 
Yep it was a mix of 90's nostalgia for me_comma_ classic toys that you just don't see anymore_comma_ and tons of nifty new age toys as well. 
I was always afraid of going to sleep as a kid. Thought I would wake up with bigfoot skinning me alive.
It does indeed. Just talking about it makes me believes he's hiding under my bed right now. Watching...waiting.
I was walking in the park when a stray dog chased after me.
No_comma_ I ran for my life.  I was so scared!
That would be the worst!
I stubbed my toe in the shower this morning...it felt like my world was coming to an abrupt end.
It does. It's all red and puffy. I am afraid that it's going to fall off any minute now!
My family forgot about me and left me behind at the house this weekend. It felt so weird to be all by myself in the house.
No ghosts_comma_ but I did order some pizza and had that delivered to me. A large pizza all for me!
Extra cheese and sausage_comma_ but I wish I could have shared a piece or two with my family.
Man I love my wife
Hopefully :)  We were high school sweethearts and got married 10 years ago!!
Thank you!!  I want to spend the rest of my life with her!
I'm disappointed in how my brownies turned out. They are so mushy!
I probably should have_comma_ but they smelled really good and I couldn't help myself!
I'm guilty as charged! :)
I'm not really sure if I am going to be able to find a gift for my wife's birthday.
I had ordered it about 6 month's ago because it was a custom made gift_comma_ but the company called me and told me that it broke in the final step.  I was supposed to get it tomorrow and there is no way that I will get it on time.  I just don't know what to do now.
I may have to push it till Christmas.
I start my new job tomorrow!
I'm going to be a fry cook at McDonalds! I can't wait to be raking in the big bucks!

I'm getting anxious thinking about moving in 2 weeks_comma_ I hope I like the city I'm moving to!
Yeah_comma_ exactly_comma_ I'm nervous but at the same time I like the idea of a change!
Yes_comma_ that is the prime reason we are moving so that's another positive.
My neighbor returned my lawn gnome today.
Oh_comma_ if you saw this one you would understand. I have won every Lawn of the Month award with it for 48 months straight. I was getting somewhat concerned because he is known from waltzing off on his own from time to time. But_comma_ I am thankful that my neighbor was quite vigilant!
Oh man.  The other night I did something GROSS
I ate some nasty mushy eggplant for dinner!!! 
No. It was something I was trying at a restaurant for dinner.  They were friend and almost made me gag!!
I'm afraid to move away from my home town_comma_ I've lived here for 26 years! I'll miss everyone!
Yeah_comma_ well my husband got a new job and it was too good to turn down!
My wife just gave me my favorite watch for my birthday.
Not a whole lot_comma_ just about $200_comma_ but I love the look of it.
I sure will.
I took a sip of milk at work and it was sour.
I am pretty sure.  I was really sickened by it.
I can't wait to go to the cinema this weekend!
The Meg. Shark attack movie.
I remember when fast food used to be really cheap.
Absolutely! Those were the good old days.
I was trying to win a gift card in the work raffle ticket contest_comma_ and I lost by one number!
Yeah_comma_ I bought a lot of tickets to try to win_comma_ so I feel sad about that.
I love the new apartment I moved into_comma_ but the only down side is I can hear traffic all night long. It's so annoying!
Yeah_comma_ right? It seems like they never stop_comma_ and not to mention the people who feel the need to make their cars as loud as possible.
A woman passed gas right in front of me at the mall.
It was loud and stank. I was really grossed out.
I ate the last piece of cake at the office party at work and didn't tell anyone.
Yeah it was too tempting. People are asking who did it_comma_ but I'll never tell.
Someone took my phone when I was at work.
It was at the office.  I have no clue who did it.  I am so mad about it!
I ate all the brownies I made. Let's just say I'm not too proud of my self control.
Yeah_comma_ they were delicious_comma_ I'm ashamed I couldn't control myself! 
I had a flat tire over the weekend_comma_ and the AAA guy changed that tire so quickly and professionally. It was very impressive!
When you have access to a service like that you are always grateful for it.
I have just started taking care of my grandmother.
She has dementia and I am the last of her family.  I hate seeing her languish in the nursing home she is in.  Hopefully I can get her doing better. 
I had to take my doggie to the vet
I hope so.  He had a seizure the other day.  Plus I had to get his shots updated anyway.
They just said to keep an eye on him and take him back if he does it again.  It was the first time he had done it in his 6 years of living.
I have to bake a chocolate cake tomorrow. 
It's for a pot luck dinner.  I am ready for the challenge. 
After visiting gym regularly for the past month_comma_ i have lost 4 pounds. I am very satisfied with my results
Reaching such feats truly makes you feel good about yourself and boosts one's self-confidence in him
I have to build a motor tomorrow. 
It is for work.  I am sure it will get done.
I just recently witnessed this guy dump a pile of garbage from his truck on the freeway. 
It was very dangerous and really messed up of the guy to do something like that. Too bad police were not around!
I'm feeling pretty guilty_comma_ I used my wife's razor's to shave this morning.
Probably not_comma_ but I feel weird about it_comma_ but surprisingly they work really well.
My favorite donut shop went out of business.
I am devastated that it's gone.
I will watch a film this weekend and I have my fingers crossed it isn't a stinker.
It's called The Meg. A shark attack movie.
I walked out the door this morning and saw a six-car pile up!
I guess one car didn't stop in time for the red light and everyone else was following too close.
You know what really grinds my gears?!
This STUPID printer that I have at work!  That thing NEVER does what I tell it to and it ALWAYS runs out of ink!!!!!
They are just as bad as this stupid printer!!
That one luggage bag that my passed uncle gave me as a present when i was about to start my college life away from home_comma_ i discarded it today as it became very old. It was the only reminder of him
It became unusable. I just decided it was its time to be thrown. I feel my uncle was here himself_comma_ not his reminders
I trusted my wife with taking my truck to visit her parents this week. I hope she takes care of it!
Yeah she is_comma_ but that truck is my baby.  Put all of time and effort in up keeping it.
I am looking forward to my new job.
Yes_comma_ custodial services.  I can't wait to start!
I can't even explain how much I care for this cat I have_comma_ it's like my best friend!
Nothing bad_comma_ just love that I have it and would be sad if I didn't!
So... I am tired of getting cold french fries every time i go to this fast food restaurant.
Should I try a different place?
Maybe I should be loyal to this chain and see if it improves.
From starting i told about my love to my family.they are not accepted after that handled more problems.finally we got both family permission.
thank you
yes i got married and now i have 8 months boy baby
My best friend is coming to visit me.
I am so happy to see her.
I went to a fast food drive thru and the cashier refused to give me my correct change or the receipt.
I was very upset_comma_ and I wanted to speak with the manager about it. Customer service is so bad these days!
I'm embarrassed that I left my car lights on all day at work. I had to get it jumped from my boss.
Yeah_comma_ you're right.  I just hate the fact it was my boss out of all people.  Hope he doesn't think down on me for it.
When I got through shopping there was a scrape on my car door where someone had banged their door into it. They didn't leave a note and I was enraged.
People just don't seem to have any respect for other peoples property anymore.
Hello there. How are you feeling today?
I'm a bit on edge. It's the anniversary of the day I had to drop out of college and I don't want to see my parents today. It brings up all the memories from the day I had to tell them. 
It really was. I know it's all okay now_comma_ but that fear is still alive inside. 
I took 100 dollars from my bosses wallet.
No_comma_ but I feel really guilty for doing that.
I just KNOW I got an amazing grade on my last test... Can't wait to see it.
Thank you! Yes_comma_ I am just feeling very sure of myself on it (for once haha).
I'm excited for tomorrow morning! I have a big presentation at work and I think my boss will love it!
Yeah_comma_ definitely prepared.  I've been working on this idea for 3 months!
I opened our bathroom door and to my surprise there was a snake laying across the floor!
I shut the door as fast as I could and ran to find someone to kill it!
My friend's new pet kitten tragically got hit by a car this past weekend. I felt so bad for her.
I know_comma_ I was crying for my friend. She needs the support right now.
I have to assemble a dresser from IKEA.
I am so ready to get it done.
I broke my favorite vase.
I was dusting and I knocked it over.  I am so upset with myself!
I was so happy to see that my little nephew made me a birthday gift!
He unexpectedly decided to make me a painting of myself with crayons. It was pretty funny.
Our toilet got clogged and we had to call a plumber to come fix it. It was actually my fault.
Nah I tried that but it was too far gone. It wasn't too pricey_comma_ but not cheap either. Oh well.
I'm sad_comma_ tomorrow will be the last time I get to see my friend before she leaves for college!
Yeah_comma_ we have a whole day planned_comma_ but I'll definitely miss her!
I am thankful that I am diligently following my saving habit. I feel in control over my urges for unnecessary spending
Emergency can always happen. Good that you had saved for that 4 months and were able to cover your car repair bills. Imagine if you haven't saved
Every time I park my car in my apartment's parking lot_comma_ someone parks way too close to me. It's annoying!
It seems to be random people each time_comma_ I think they just made the spacing way too close.
I never win anything but took a chance on buying a few lottery tickets the and I won $50_comma_000!
Considering I never win_comma_ it made it even more awesome_comma_ yes!
I'm in a new city and don't know what to do.
All of my co-workers are married and live in the suburbs.
I will try_comma_ but I'm such a shy person. Thanks for your advice.
A friend tried to get me to drink and drive but I didn't. 
I was happy with my behavior.
I watched this scary shark film this weekend. I had to cover my eyes throughout the movie!
Yes! The graphics look so realistic these days!
My co-worker makes almost double the amount I do and yet does about half the work...
Yeah I think so too. I'm really envious that he can pull that off while I have to do everything.
My favorite bakery is making donuts in a few hours.
Yes_comma_ I can't wait to get some!
The Olympics skaters are really good atheletes_comma_ I'm impressed
Some are very graceful and artistic and some are very powerful
I looked out my window this morning and saw a skunk staring right back at me!
It was a decent size. Maybe like a small dog. I didn't smell it_comma_ but I as still freaked out by it.
I dropped a mug and my coffee went everywhere
No_comma_ just a hassle to clean it all up
I was jogging a couple days ago and suddenly a bear came out of the woods!
Yeah_comma_ I just stopped in shock_comma_ but it crossed the path and kept going without missing a beat.
I am looking forward to the winter.
I can't wait for the cold!
I'm very happy with my baking skills_comma_ people tell me I make really good cookies
I make chocolate chip_comma_ but snickerdoodles are my favorite
My boyfriend can sing really well but I can't
Thanks_comma_ maybe I just need to warm up my vocal chords more
I want to do well in my next exams_comma_ I want to get my certification
I will_comma_ I have been going over the textbooks a lot
I never thought that I would be noticed. 
My employers gave me employee of the month and a nice gift to go along with the award.
Yes_comma_ they really caught caught me off guard. I did work very hard_comma_ but there's a lot of other good employees on our team.
I love my wife so much.
I always do.  I would never cheat on her.
I noticed that I had toilet paper on the bottom of my shoe at work. No one told me!
Yes! I felt so bad that no one was willing to let me know.
I split my pants while bending over at work.
Yes_comma_ I felt so humiliated. 
My favorite pizza place closed down late last week.
Yes_comma_ it sure was. Made GREAT pizza. I miss them already...
One time I tripped over nothing and landed on my face
I'm so clumsy_comma_ my balance is just terrible sometimes
We have a camping site booked and I got everything packed up. My family won't get out of bed so we can get going. I hate waiting.
yeah_comma_ I spend half my life waiting for my family. 
We could leave anytime. I'm an early riser. Do you get up early?
when my grandpa died i was so sad_comma_ i did not know if i could move on
i could not believe it
I was driving in a sketchy part of town to drop a computer off to a friend_comma_ and I did not feel safe at all
It was very run-down and it was dark out (plus low speed)
I am going to a concert later tonight.
Yes!  I can't wait to go!
Thank you for the kind words!
My hamster got out of its cage and I haven't been able to find him
So do I. I hope he's not hurt somewhere
The traffic was so bad this morning. 
It just makes me so mad!
I visited an old friend the other day who lives about an hour away from me in another town_comma_ and her 10 year son has this new puppy they got. He was showing me all things he had taught this puppy to do in the last week of having him. The dog could already shake_comma_ lay down_comma_ sit_comma_ roll over_comma_ run in a circle_comma_ jump_comma_ and sit still when a treat was put on his nose until you tell him okay.
I know! The puppy is a 12 week old Schnauzer_comma_ I guess they are super smart! 
Had a little bit of a hospital stay to have routine surgery. A co-worker came to visit me while I was there_comma_ which surprised me. Kinda nice to see something unexpected like that_comma_ for people to show they care.
I am! I'm back in civilization. It was just minor surgery but they had to keep me for a couple of days to make sure things went okay. Thank you for asking.
I expected a hike in my package.
Sorry _comma_ I mean my salary. But I didn't get it this time.
Yesterday I saw a guy leave the bathroom without washing his hands.
It was really gross behavior.
I got to quit my terrible job a few weeks ago. 
It was very much so. I put up with them for a year_comma_ terrible pay_comma_ constantly changing rules. They said they were going to promote me but didnt
I went thru my childrens old clothes the other day and its hard to believe they are grown up now. 
I think we probably feel it about the same! It was a nice memory to come across tho. 
I was going through some boxes in my moms storage unit looking for something the other day and came across a bunch of my great great grandmas momento boxes. We looked inside them and found some super weird stuff_comma_ like a ponytail full of my grandmas grandmas hair! I was so weirded out!
I suppose_comma_ it was in a plastic bag_comma_ and we were so surprised to see that it was the same color as my hair and my moms. I just felt kinda nervous around stuff that dead relatives had_comma_ like their hair.. lol
I failed to pass in my exam.
It's university final exam. It makes me sad.
I sent off a difficult email today and a bit worried about the response.
It was a personal email about some tough life things. They do better if I email versus face to face. I am very anxious about the response as they have a temper.
Sad that my partner is not making as much progress as he should be.
In his life yes. He is going to counseling but nothing is changing and it's been a month.
Moving my grandmother to an assisted living facility from her independent life has been such a transition for the whole family. Seniors can be stubborn and its been stressful to help her feel at home there and not hate it. Yesterday after visiting her however_comma_ she actually is looking more happy to be there finally.
Yes_comma_ before that all the time we spent with her was filled with caring for her basic needs instead of doing enjoyable leisure activities with her. 
I was running late for work because I woke up late. 
I made it on time_comma_ but didn't have time to pit my contacts in so I had to wear my ugly broken glasses
For my 21st birthday my friends threw me a surprise party. Friends that I hadn't seen in years showed up_comma_ it was great. 
Yea I was so shocked_comma_ they really came through for me. They are great people!
I have tried long and hard to lose a few pounds and i finally did_comma_ now i can wear that shirt that i use to wear and it fits me now. yayy
Thank you_comma_ i am getting older so living a healthy lifestyle is also in my best interest.
My parents didn't save enough for retirement_comma_ and now that they're retirement age_comma_ they're struggling a little. I'm still in college and am not able to really help them. I'm worried about how they'll survive financially_comma_ and I feel guilty about not being able to offer much.
Yeah_comma_ it's a growing problem and I think it's only going to get worse. My dad isn't in the best health_comma_ and is on a lot of medications_comma_ so that kind of hinders them a bit_comma_ too. I just wish they could actually relax and enjoy retirement like they deserve_comma_ instead of having to worry.
Went to a fast food place_comma_ and they messed up my order. I even repeated it twice_comma_ and had them double-check with me again after that! I know they're under a lot of pressure and work hard_comma_ but why is order accuracy so hard...
Oh_comma_ it doesn't really matter_comma_ but it was just McDonald's. Funny enough_comma_ they have those new self-order kiosk things_comma_ and when I do it on there_comma_ it almost always comes out right_comma_ since I'm doing it myself. Unfortunately_comma_ you can only do that inside :(
Hah.. that's a very interesting point
Before I met my girlfriend and friends I was very alone_comma_ that was not a fun time
That is for sure_comma_ it was not in a great place_comma_ but with some hard work_comma_ you can always improve
I won $100 on a scratch off today. I was shocked. I never win.
I usually go on our Tuesday break to buy one with coworkers.
Yes Tony Bennett sounded great at the concert in April. His rendition of "How Do You Keep the Music Playing?" was especially good.
It was fantastic! He belted out every song with power! Sounded very good for his age. He did "Fly Me to The Moon" without a mic at the end!
Yes! It was an experience of a lifetime! He still has concerts scheduled for later this year as well!
Super sad this past weekend without my significant other.
No not really break up. He is away getting help and he needs it so I have to tough it out.
I do! it is hard but that is why I am willing to do through it.
My son is sick so I am taking him some soup.
Mom_comma_ I enjoy being able to do little things for my kids like that to show them I care no matter how old they get.
Thanks for that compliment!
Yesterday I came across a huge snake in my back yard!
I think it was. I was too freaked out. Just ran inside.
I'm in Tennessee. Yeah_comma_ I would have a panic attack as well! That's a scary situation! 
It is a rough day_comma_ I am alone a lot lately. 
Oh yes I am normally busy but those pangs of loneliness hit. I hate them!
The mosquitos where I live seemed to be getting really bad! When sitting by the fire at night we get so eaten up even with bug spray and candles! So for this last time we did a fire I bought these two blue lantern things that attract the mosquitoes and zap them to death! Let me tell you_comma_ those mosquitoes didn't stand a chance_comma_ and no bug spray needed!
Yes! You can order them online from large retailers! It is a must have if you spend a good amount of time outdoors in mosquito prone areas!
My neighbor threw their nasty trash all over their yard and won't clean it up! It's sooo gross!
I did and they are crazy or something_comma_ they told me that I deserve to smell and see it!
Thank you_comma_ I didn't realize I could to that!
I am excited for the new super smash bros game coming out for the switch soon
I love how portable it is_comma_ I have played so many hours I would not have had time for otherwise_comma_ and the games are fantastic
I worked hard the entire smesetr only yo fail again!
stuoid math class_comma_ I try so hard and always have nothing to show for it.
"I got a new haircut the other day after not cutting it for years. It feels so good to have some type of change_comma_ and I feel so good about myself just from such a small change!
It only got to midway down my arms_comma_ but I never got it cut for years because I just have a fear of cutting my hair like it will never grow back or something. It was only 2 inches but looks so much better
I get emotional about my brothers_comma_ they are very important to me
Yes_comma_ they both live in the same house as me
The other night I was walking alone and a guy kept following me. 
I did not that night. You just can't let men or anyone get close to you at night...It's too much of a risk. I turned to go in another direction and he still followed. I ended up getting OFF the walkway and walking quickly so I could lose him. I have a small pepper spray now but I had forgotten it.
I am getting started on my work week. I didn't go out much this past weekend and instead worked in my garden. It was very tranquil.
I have tomatoes_comma_ peppers_comma_ corn_comma_ and summer squash coming up now. I just put down some winter squash so I'm good for when it's cold.
I think so_comma_ I have been doing it for awhile now.
I asked my friend to get some stuff for a party_comma_ I knew I could count on him though.
About 50 people roughly_comma_ I have no doubt he will pull through though.
I just received a job offer but I am not sure if I should take it or not.
The pay and benefits are great but the location is not ideal. So I dont know.
I took my best friend's sister out on a date secretly.
He would be upset.  I feel so ashamed.
I don't think so.
I am so mad that I lost my wallet last night.
If not I am in big trouble due to it having all my Id's.
Really not looking forward to having to pay student loans once I graduate. Why does it cost so much to get an education? How do young people survive right out of college when they get slammed with all of this debt? It seems kind of rigged
Well it's not necessarily that it was dumb to take out loans_comma_ it's just the amount you have to take out_comma_ how expensive college is_comma_ how much interest is paid on them_comma_ how you can escape them from bankruptcy_comma_ and how you have almost no time at all before you have to start paying them back before you've even gotten on your feet after graduating... Sorry_comma_ just stressful
My birthday is soon_comma_ it's always a wonderful time to reflect. It's a great time of year for me!
Thank you. I think you need to be a little easier on yourself. No one's life is perfect or just as they want it but we need to make the most out of what we have.
Feeling positive about this week. 
Well sure! I am alive_comma_ I have some of my health. A new baby puppy_comma_ money etc etc! Good food. Lots of positives :) Also Hoping my partner grows by leaps and bounds after a month in therapy.
My brother is having a baby_comma_ I'm shocked.
Cause I didn't even know he talked to girls.
I'm in the middle of breaking down some pork shoulder. I have to slow cook for an eternity haha_comma_ it's going to be so tasty.
I will mail you some_comma_ haha! I'm cooking a lot of it_comma_ I will be set for a very long time.
I get to go to Greece in a few weeks! 
I budgeted for a year to make sure I could afford it. Well worth it!
I am hyped for the new super smash bros game coming out for the switch soon
It sure will be_comma_ I am super excited for it_comma_ plus they will add more characters I am sure
I have an old truck that I enjoy working on and driving around.
That's cool. Mine is a 68 chevy c10
It's a family heirloom.
I've done it all myself. It takes a long time_comma_ but that's part of the fun.
My class is finally over and now I just wait for my grade to be posted.
I know I did very well.
I miss taking road trips with my friends
No fun riding fours hours with a bunch of kids. I think those days are over
Im am going to try to get a group together to do something soon. I think it will be fun
My roommate's friend comes over and just eats all of the food in our fridge without really asking. I don't get how people can have a total lack of self-awareness and can be so selfish to just barge in and eat other people's food. I cringe at thinking about being that rude to someone
I'm not really a confrontational person... I asked my roommate to say something since he knows him better obviously. He said he brought it up_comma_ but didn't seem to change much. Then I kind of said something too_comma_ but the guy just kind of laughed it off_comma_ like he thinks we're just joking. I dunno what goes through his head
Haha... maybe I'll take that into consideration
I get emotional about my brothers_comma_ they are very important to me
I guess not_comma_ I just do not want them to move away or leave
I hate seeing my friends take fancy vacations all the time.
It is_comma_ and with social media it's like we are bombarded by the rich and famous.
I've been feeling so horrible lately and I went to the doctor.
Yes! The doctor determined that I have a thyroid problem and started me on medication. I'm optimistic that I'll be feeling better soon!
I live out in the middle of nowhere and after not hearing them at all this summer_comma_ I heard a pack of coyotes the other night.
I try to set up natural barriers to deter them. I'm sure they are scare of me more so than I am of them but they can be quite the nuisance and scary to see on sight.
My sister insisted on popping a pimple on my back. I really didn't want her to do it.
She was sitting behind me and helped herself to it.
I am hoping the new super smash bros will be excellent_comma_ it looks the part so far!
In december_comma_ still far away to me!
My boyfriend is starting to get on my nerves.
He is always talking to other girls. 
This has been a long year.
Financial troubles mostly. I've been working my tail off to solve that.
I walked my kids all the way to school and then realized I had forgotten her backpack
I had to make a second trip. Its a long walk. I was so mad at myself
Yeah I may have lost a couple of pounds already
I have never lied to my wife.
I have been tempted to lie_comma_ but I never can bring myself to do it.
I'm feeling so concerned this morning. I lent my brother my car and he's a horrible driver.
Thanks_comma_ me too! He was stuck and needed it and it's only a car_comma_ right? Still_comma_ I know I'll be on the edge of my seat all day.
Before I met my girlfriend and friends I was very alone_comma_ that was not a fun time
Thank you_comma_ I am glad as well_comma_ life has improved a lot
I am mad at my job recently_comma_ they are overworking us a lot
More hours and also more work crammed in_comma_ so bad on both sides
It took a long time to do it due to a lot of hardships in life_comma_ but my wife finally graduated from a masters program over the Summer.
Her degree is in forensic chemistry. She already landed a job right after graduating too_comma_ we are both ecstatic.
I am hoping the new super smash bros will be as good as it looks
I have the Nintendo Switch and PS4
my ex boyfriend keeps trying to get back together with me
He gambles too much. He is starting to annoy me now
Thats the plan
I'm tired of this hot weather. I'm ready for Fall.
What do you think is your favorite part of Fall ?
Today would've been my little sister's 3rd birthday. 
She was killed in a car crash last year.
Everyone went back to college_comma_ I'll need to find new people to hang out with but I don't have the energy.
That could be an option but I'll miss my actual friends a lot.
I've got the rest of the day off and I'm just going to sit in the couch and relax.
Yeah_comma_ sometimes it's nice to just do a lot of nothing.
Yeah_comma_ I highly recommend it.
I didn't put my blinker on and got a ticket for it.
Yes_comma_ but he wasn't having it.
I am excited for the new super smash bros game coming out for the switch soon
They sure do_comma_ so many characters I cannot play with them all!
We're taking a family trip to the lake this Sunday to go fishing. I'm looking forward to it_comma_ since I really like fishing but haven't been in a while.
It's pretty relaxing! It doesn't require much out of you_comma_ so if you enjoy being out with nature (and getting something good to eat while you're doing it)_comma_ it's a fun time.
I waited and waited but I finally got my security deposit back from my old apartment. Took my landlord long enough!
Haha that's for sure. They always wait until the last possible moment allowed by law_comma_ if there is one. At least now I can put down on a new palce.
I think it's going to be another apartment_comma_ I lead kind of a small life.
My mom really helps me with so much_comma_ I can leave my animals in her care if anything happens to me. That is a relief!
Bunnies_comma_ turtle_comma_ dogs and loads of cats :)
For sure_comma_ I would do anything for them. I'm glad I have someone to rely on as well to take care of them if anything happens. I rescue everything :)
I'm ready for Fall.
Yes_comma_ and I'm looking forward to the changing colors_comma_ and cool breezes.
I am feeling nervous about leaving for my trip. I am supposed to go for three months.
I am going all over western Europe. Its a little daunting to think about. 
My boss gave me the afternoon off.
Just gonna chill.  The new warcraft expansion came out. I'll probably check that out too.
Thanks_comma_ I will :D
I was heartbroken when my grandmother passed away
Pretty close_comma_ yeah. It still stings sometimes_comma_ but she would not want me to harp on it
We had some limbs fall recently from storms and I've had to work hard to clean it all up.
No_comma_ but it has been a lot of work.
My partner/semi partner (lol) wants to come over next weekend..but I am not feeling comfortable with it.
He is in counseling and I don't feel he has made much progress yet. So I don't want to step back in too anything too quickly..where I end up getting destroyed again
I asked my friend to get some stuff for a party_comma_ I knew he would come through though.
Like food and decorations and things like that.
I saw a guy riding on the side of the road to the store in his scooter/wheelchair. 
He was very old. I felt bad for him that he didn't have any family to help! he almost got hit a few times. I mean..maybe he is happy? But I just felt bad :(
true! I would love that. I just felt bad he didn't have any family. I have lost a lot of people too and it would be hard to be all alone.
A man keeps asking me out on a date_comma_ not understanding that I would never cheat on my husband.
Yes_comma_ I have but he is relentless! Whoever taught men to never give up is the devil!
Hi! I've been pacing around all day waiting to hear from the vet. My cats are getting checked out right now.
They've been ill lately. I'm hoping it is some kind of stomach bug_comma_ waiting on the call from my vet is driving me up the wall!
Thank you for your concern. I'm holding onto a lot of hope for sure.
The other day I was driving to a street when I heart a explosion.
An electril pole have fallen and there was a lot of noise and spark_comma_ thank god it only fall on the fence_comma_ but I didn't leave until I saw people living there were ok and reporting it.
I was washing my car in my front yard the other day_comma_ and my 2 1/2 year old gets a hold of the hose and starts running from me. There are several people outside doing whatever theyre dong that see this. Everytime I got within 2 feet of my kid he would spray me in the face with the hose and keep running. This just went on and on while everyone watched probably laughing at me.
Yeah its just like they are a baby with no knowledge of what a hose is or what it does and then one day they just become so smart and know how to use everything and not for the greater good!
Got into a small car accident the other day. Everybody was fine_comma_ both drivers and passengers. It was totally my fault though.. and now I'm worried about the insurance rates afterwards. I'm a college student_comma_ and can't afford much more
Not exactly. My major in college requires an internship_comma_ and it's kind of far away.. it'd be hard to yo-yo around on public transportation and make sure I can be there on time. Maybe I'll just start selling my body on the street!
Haha yeah_comma_ got a little carried away. I'll look into that too. Anything helps I guess
I have been watching a lot of prison shows. It really sad
PEople do horrible things sometimes. Its just terrible
IT is interesting to watch but still a bit disheartening
I miss the 90s! The best music_comma_ snacks_comma_ and tv shows!
Double Dare_comma_ Rugrats_comma_ Doug_comma_ Figure it Out
I watched a man eat 3 pounds of canned tuna.
Yes_comma_ it was very gross to witness!
It can be interesting sometimes but not on this occasion.
I do not like being around cats_comma_ they scare me.
I was attacked by one when I was little.
My mother recently got accepted to teach at an ivy league college.
Princeton
I was once walking through a forest
It was a very thick and dark one at night time.
Some man was talking to my girlfriend at the carnival.
No_comma_ thank god. But I was extremely on edge. No one should be talking to her except for me.
I have two beautiful daughters.
10 and 13 years old.
I lied to my friend about something_comma_ I'm too ashamed to even say what.
It could_comma_ I guess I should come clean.
My neighbors had a really loud fight the other night at 2am.
Not quite as loud_comma_ but they have before. They break up about once a month. I think the police did come.
My friend and I are supposed to go to a water park this weekend. I've never been to a water park_comma_ so I'm sooorta looking forward to it.
Oh yeah_comma_ I love to swim! Especially when it's so dang hot outside.
I took out the trash last night and the can tipped over ontop of me
It did I felt so gross and couldnt get the smell off of me even after several showers
I have to go to the dentist's office tomorrow and I'm dreading it. 
No_comma_ I can't really take any medication right now. I wish I could though because everything about the dentist gives me anxiety.
My husband left me_comma_ I have no one.
2 weeks ago_comma_ I don't even have anyone to talk to. It's the worst.
I went to visit my grandmother since she had been very sick and bed ridden for a couple weeks.  When I got there_comma_ I saw her get up and out of bed!
Yup_comma_ she was down and out and we were not sure how long it was going to take for her to get better.
Why thank you_comma_ it was a surprise for all.
My cars auto locks went out on me. It is such a pain having to manually check them all the times.
It is. It doesnt seem cheap to fix either.
i was scared walking home last night
yes it was dark and a wooded area
I know that I will make the NHL next season.
I do have a backup plan but hopefully I won't need it.
My last school semester went pretty rough. I'm really wanting this one to go better; I'm planning to put more effort into studying this time.
I'm hoping it will help with my classes_comma_ since I'm taking some difficult ones this semester.
I went to the store and something bad happened.
The place done got robbed!
I am going to Disney next week!
I have never been before_comma_ I hope it's everything I dreamed it to be!
I felt pretty sad when I when I didn't get invited to the person's event. Mostly because we knew a lot of the same people.
Well I thought about saying something_comma_ but I feel like you can't force a friendship.
i loved taking care of my sisters pet
a bearded dragon
I think my car has quit for good.
Transmission not worth the money. This isnt a good neighborhood to walk in
Save for something new. Thats gonna ruin christmas
yep. gotta do what I gotta do
I'm so excited that school starts tomorrow. I need a break!
Mine are acting extra bad today for some reason!
Yeah I definitely won't forget!
I honestly don't understand the whole concept of homeschool..like why???
I accidentally stepped in dog poop the other day_comma_ ugh.
Fortunately not_comma_ but I was wearing sandals so I guess it's even worse really
I'm feeling positive about the newborn we have here and that he will make it! 
I hope so. I have had enough death this past year. He seems to be growing everyday and is very chunky and nursing well.
I am so happy to start my new job next week! 
data entry work in an office setting_comma_ its going to be great. i cant wait 
I am going to go see a cover band of my favorite band soon.
They're called Found a Job_comma_ they cover Talking Heads songs.
They were big in the 70s/80s. They did that song psycho killer. It is what they are most known for. Kinda pop/rocky
I'm tired of being harassed by this corrupt city. 
Everything from my grass an inch too tall (by the way I have abandoned houses all around me with all kinds of debris and grass 7ft tall) to..My car parked on MY lawn..They don't show up to gunshots all night_comma_ fire bombs_comma_ breaking in too abandoned houses_comma_ rapes_comma_ beatings..but they care if my own car is parked on a lawn that I mow????
I hear you! It's vampire city here at night
i think my son is addicted to screens and he is three
I have to. He like to have my phone and the ipad playing the same video
I dont want him not wanting to play physically when he is older
I have had extra money to save up the past few weeks!
Everything and anything. Because it all happens constantly in life
I had no prior experience going ice climbing! This was very strenuous and particular.
It was enjoyable! We saw incredible views of the glacier! I wish I had a go-pro filming the experience though.
 I had a terrible experience when I was out the other day with my daughter.. people can be so rude. 
These 2 women were standing behind us just laughing_comma_ and everytime I would look behind me they would do the thing like " oh shhh " and cover their face and laugh. 
My friend has a pet spider and they made me hold it the other day. 
Yeah it was huge_comma_ and I was scared to even move. 
i was happy when i got the weekend off
yea i do_comma_ i wanted to go fly fishing
My state sent me a tax bill for my newly opened business for $7_comma_000!!!
 I haven't even made $100 yet..and I have not used my tax exempt status...So that was shocking! I swear..everytime I open the mail..it's anxiety city! I called and they said it was just an estimate to make me file my taxes :/ I'm like...I didn't even make anything last year..My partner did- I was pregnant and sick! I was also on medicaid so how did I make 100_comma_000?? lol! Ridiculous.
They said I just had to file to re-assess that..Thank god..I thought...Thats way more then I ever made and I haven't even taken sales tax on anything yet..and I have PAID sales tax..taxed twice? So weird! I almost had a heart attack..as I already owe ENOUGH on property taxes..1200 a year..plus $100 extra a MONTH if you're late to live in the ghetto...Never move to Michigan ;)
I'm thinking I might have to find a different line of work. I'm a truck driver_comma_ and have been for a long time_comma_ but it's really difficult to do long trips now that I'm married.
That's the tricky part_comma_ I don't really know. I don't have a good college education or anything and truck driving pays well_comma_ it's just not healthy for my current lifestyle. My cousin does heating and cooling and offered to help me there_comma_ so I think I'll take him up on that.
Hi I went to a skating park.
Yes but sometimes they are also indoors.
Yes there are some very talented people that skate there
The garbage men had trash strewn all over and they just left it- It fell out apparently when they were throwing trash in the truck.
Nope! They never do here. I don't understand not doing your job and they provide a great service! but they should really do it well.
I found a old tool box with my grandfather's tools in it in the garage.
Sure did.  He was a carpenter.
It was cool just to look through them_comma_ eventhough I'm not much of a carpenter myself.
i was pissed when i saw someone had put a dent in my door
no cameras
i was pissed when i saw my gate left open
someone left the gate open_comma_ probably my energy company_comma_ and my dog got out
My friend can juggle 4 knives at once!
None! I have no idea how he can do that without hurting himself
I'm so mad at my neighbor! He blasts his tv outside on his patio all night long.
I've reported him to the association because it's against our rules_comma_ but he doesn't care. I don't know how people can be so selfish.
i was scared walking home last week
someone was following me
There was a turtle in my yard one day just panting and hot and all dried out.
I have her now. At that time I did not have a car and was not near a water source and it was like 120 everyday down south. Normally they stay buried- it's a box turtle. Much like a tiny land tortoise. Her name is mrs. Lee :) Sweetest turtle ever
I take great care of her. Supposedly they live 100 years or so_comma_ wow..So I have to make sure she will be taken care of if I am not around. They eat them down south anyway..all moving things.including little turtles :( so I felt better about having her with me. 
I think I can get everything I need to get accomplished before the end of summer.
Lots of cleaning. Cleaning out the garage and basement_comma_ repainting etc. All stuff that needs to be done before winter is over
Lots of cleaning. Cleaning out the garage and basement_comma_ repainting etc. All stuff that needs to be done before winter is over
I finally went on my first rollercoaster since I've never been to an amusement park. What's the deal with rollercoasters?! How is that fun_comma_ that's not fun_comma_ that's scary!
I think I might be done with rollercoasters already_comma_ haha.
I was so surprised when I found I was pregnant
oh no not at all but I am happy about it
Sometime around april I will be expecting to give birth
I stripped in front of the cute barista at the coffee shop. I dont think I can return. 
Whoops!!! I mean I tripped. What an inconvenient typo!!! I must be so frazzled. 
Im not that crazy but I do feel kind of dumb. I tripped over my shoestring and spilled coffee everywhere. What a moron. 
My baby can hold her own forks now and feed herself. :o So proud of her and happy for me. lol
it really is! :) im one happy mama thats for sure
i was happy to get the weekend off
went to the coast
I spent 5 hours baking a cake yesterday. 
I do it just as a hobby_comma_ when I finished this one my wife dropped it_comma_ I was so mad
I'm at a good weight and I'm fairly healthy_comma_ but I'm visiting my girlfriend right now and I always over-eat and eat desserts that I shouldn't when I'm around her. Makes me feel like an overweight slob
Yeah_comma_ the problem is I associate my visits with her_comma_ since they're few and far between_comma_ as times where I can let loose. But this summer I stayed with her for an entire month_comma_ so I let loose for an entire month.. not healthy
Yesterday at work during lunch I noticed my shirt was inside out.
I fixed it of course but_comma_ everyone must of seen and saw how ridiculous I looked with it inside out
Going to an amusement park later in the week_comma_ before college semester starts back up. A little scared to get on roller coasters since I don't like heights_comma_ but kind of pumped to feel the adrenaline rush and feeling of accomplishment after doing something scary
Not to this specific one_comma_ but I've ridden some before. None that will be as big as the ones at this park though. I'm a little intimidated. The anxiety that you feel while you wait in line always gets me.. But the high you get afterwards seems worth it
Im waiting on a nice sized check to come and cant wait to go spend it! 
household decor_comma_ food_comma_ shopping_comma_ fun :) for once in my life lol
Every Sunday I goto church.
Having something to believe in makes me feel whole
I was talking to my pastor the other day and i got all emotional and i cursed! I was so embarrased
i know he did but i actually don't curse_comma_ i don't know why i did that time
it was suprising to see someone eat a 3 lbs burger
yea he was able to eat for free since he ate it all
I am really starting to miss my friends and family. I have been traveling for a few months now.
I am on vacation. The hostel I checked into is really empty right now so I have been thinking of home a lot.
I'm going on date tonight after work. I think its going to go well.
I'm normally not but_comma_ I have a good feeling here for some reason.
That's the plan!
Super upset that my yard received a ticket for being too long yet all the abandoned houses around me have 5ft tall grass.
Once a week_comma_ makes it hard when I work two jobs like good people do- I am not retired just mowing my yard all do. Makes it hard when my mower was stolen as well..which the police do nothing about..instead of ticketing decent people_comma_ they should try and stop all the rapes and shootings in the area and deal with all the abandoned houses
They just want to make easy money. Blight people are supposed to do something about abandoned housing issues..Like furniture and trash all over.
My friend just got into graduate school
It's great! She really didn't think she would be accepted.
Economics. She wants to save the world with better economic policies.
I am not sure about going to this new mechanic. I have good and bad things
I have heard he overcharges
I was very sad when my company had left me alone the other day.
They had to leave on an emergency and so then I was all by myself..
First time I went to my very first Dungeons and Dragons get-together_comma_ I felt really overwhelmed with all the verbiage and rules and stuff like that. Had no idea what I was doing and felt dumb. Did my best to learn what I could this time around_comma_ and I plan to not drag everyone else down
I'm not sure yet actually_comma_ I think we're collectively making new ones when we gather up tomorrow. I usually play some sort of thief though_comma_ as unoriginal as that is!
I can't wait to see the leaves begin to change.
It is_comma_ I long for it all summer.
i loved taking care of my sisters pet the other day
its a bearded dragon
I lost my keys in the store and it took me 2 hours to find them! I was a mess. 
Someone found them and turned them into customer service luckily. 
I feel so isolated. I just moved to a new city where I don't know anyone.
It really is! I don't have any family or friends around. I miss them!
I'll do that! Thanks for the advice!
I just got some crushing news. I just got a call to tell me I did not get the job I really wanted.
Yea it was a really great opportunity too. It will be hard to find something similar.
I was insanely upset when our CAR got a ticket for being on my OWN lawn.
They said I had to move it within so many days or they would TAKE it...Are you kidding me?. They say it's city property yet I mow it and maintain it..and pay taxes on it..Yet I can't park my car on it?
Thats bull crap is what it is. Then they can mow it themselves and maintain it.
i was upset when my dog got out
or i let him out :)
I'll be getting a promotion in Feb. I didn't expect it.
Yep_comma_ and it's a 25% raise too.
I have been traveling for three months now. I am really starting to miss my family and friends.
Its really cheap in South East Asia. Its low season and there arent many people in the hostel so I have been thinking of home a lot.
Something terrible just happened to me!
Not really..
My friend done brought my new shoes back with the poo on them!
I like to wear my grandfathers watch that I inherited for luck. I can still picture him wearing it.
I like to think so. It just makes me feel a little better. Its like having him right there with me.
I ate some homemade ice cream the other day. What a wonderful treat.
No my friend has an ice cream maker and she was trying it out. She's got talent.
You sound like an enterprising individual.
i was happay when i got approved for the day off
you got that right
I found a big web in my bathroom window one day. I generally don't like spiders but I don't like to harm anything (unless its mosquitos or fleas).
Yes..I now have a bathroom spider. He weaves beautiful webs..but he does scare me when he comes out.
No way! - I don't use chemicals..and thats terrible. I am not going to harm nature when it does no harm to me. It's needed.
I'm going on vacation tomrrow and i'll be gone for the rest of the week.
I'm single so_comma_ My extended family isn't coming with me but_comma_ I've got no wife or kids to leave behind.
I always behave... mostly..
I think I will get my debt paid off sooner than I originally planned!
It's a huge relief but I need to make sure everything goes as planned or it won't happen.
I came across an old highschool photo book. Memories. 
Yeah a lot of good memories. 
i was annoyeed when i was told that i had to work last weekend
i wanted to go fishing
I have been working on getting a lot better at my job. It requires a lot of studying.
I have to read all the benchmarks that we use to do our work and read all the policies. It is so much reading.
i cant wait until next week!
the kids go back to school
it was impressive to see someone eat a 3 lbs burger the other day
well they got the meal for free and a free tshirt
This has been a very long summer.
It's been so hot. I'm ready for Fall.
My friend recommended me for a job at his company. I am so happy he thought of me.
Trust me. If I get this job I will be getting him a thank you gift.
I am getting a good business this year from office. 
thank you!! i can't wait to spend the bonus. So excited
I'm sad. My youngest son starts kindergarten tomorrow!
I mean i'm happy for the up coming peace and quiet but it's still sad all my kids aren't babies anymore.
I've got a 12 year old that's getting mighty close!
I had left my house for the day_comma_ and my neighbor called me and told me I had left my garage door open.  I was very appreciative because someone could have easily robbed me
My neighbor probably saved me from getting some expensive stuff stolen.  It is nice to have neighbors you trust
Girlfriend forgot her lunch_comma_ about to go bring it to her. It's going to seem like I'm doing something really nice_comma_ but I wasn't doing anything important anyway. Would rather her not have to inconvenience herself since she's at work
Yeah_comma_ I was thinking the same thing. I feel a little guilty getting easy credit for something that isn't a big deal_comma_ but whatever I can do to help out_comma_ I guess.
it was suprising seeing someone eat a 3 lbs burger for a free tshirt
yea it was_comma_ and it was kinda gross towards the end 
I'm so angry! I lent my friend my expensive_comma_ designer dress and not only did she stain it_comma_ it's torn!!
I wanted to!! I'm never lending her anything ever again!
I moved into a new state recently_comma_ and there's a lot to do_comma_ but I don't have any friends in the new place I stay at.
How late were you?
 My brother pulled a mean prank 
 No. Afterwards_comma_ I realized it was pretty funny_comma_ actually.
My brother snapped my skatebaord
Shortly after_comma_ he had it coming.
i was upset when i couldnt get the day off
yea_comma_ didnt matter.
I really wanted to go with my family on vacation but I couldnt go and it sucks. 
No I cant you know how work can be! ugh adult life right. 
I don't think I should drive in town today_comma_ I have a bad feeling.
Nothing yet but I'm sure something bad will happen.
i was pissed when someone put a dent in my door
no they did not
Im going to the beach after work_comma_ and I am so excited_comma_ cant wait.... counting down every little second. 
2 more hours and i am outtie! 
I'm making guacamole for the first time.
Oh I definitely google'd it. I hope it turns out well. It does have a lot of good reviews.
Got a box of ramen. Should last me through the week.
Oh yea. I don't think I know one person who doesn't like ramen!
I am starting a scary type of new job today.
Yes_comma_ it is hazardous because of chemicals. And also my friend told me that the people working there are not fun and also not very nice.
Thank you!
I have a big test coming up_comma_ I wish time would hurry up so I can get it over with.
Next Tuesday! 
I have been waiting a few weeks for a bird cage to come_comma_ and it was supposed to come today but it hasnt. :( Bummed.
Yeah to no response of course. I am upset about it. 
The new job for me is going to be great!
It is the field of technology
Thank you!
I have never cheated on a person I have been in a relationship with.
No thankfully_comma_ I feel that would be wrong to do
Well_comma_ Fall is almost upon us at last.
Yes_comma_ it certainly is...and winter my second favorite.
I was in the city last week_comma_ I saw a homeless man picking through the garbage
No I was grossed out by him digging through the trash and eating it.
This dude keeps blowing up my girlfriend's phone
Yea_comma_ he knows she's with me. Dude is just rude.
I start my new job tomorrow.
I will be working as a consultant_comma_ I am extremely nervous
Thanksgiving is almost here. 
I plan to spend the holiday with my family and eat lots of good food. I am so appreciative of this day.
I just recently applied for my dream college
Not yet_comma_ but I hope i do!
We had a tornado touch down near our house_comma_ only about 1 mile away. It ended up being a deadly one too. 
a lot of damage all around_comma_ minor damage to my home but it was real bad 
Have you ever felt alone in a crowd.
I sometimes feel this way. It's kinda sad.
My brother has developed a habit of prank calling me.
Yea_comma_ occasionally it is funny but most of the time it is bothersome.
Hi_comma_ I bought myself a new gadget today
It is a touch screen computer tablet.
Well this one didn't even work for me!
I got a call from my friend.  Him and his wife are expecting their first kid and were just told they are having triplets!
I have no idea.  I do not think they have them picked out yet.  They are still trying to wrap their head around having three kids.  
The other day I found out that my sister is having twins!
Yeah she is very excited_comma_ she's having twin boys. I can't wait to be an uncle!
I spilled some sweet and sour sauce on my friends couch while I was eating chicken nuggets.
Yea I think so I put some rubbing alcohol and then rubbed it with force.
It is my friends birthday today and we had lunch together.
I had a hamburger with a large black hair in it!
I hope I will win the contest I have entered!
I have entered to win a ticket to my favorite amusement park!
I got promoted to a line cook and it couldn't have gone smoother.
It's a Mexican restaurant but they also serve fast food type stuff there too.  It's' a very complex menu_comma_ it's a lot to prepare.
I've had some time to observe how the folks in the kitchen cook and prep. Also there was a new manager and she allowed me to start helping more.
Thanks. I have had a very strict manager before and she seemed a little stiff and reluctant to let me do anything but prep food and not cook. It was frustrating_comma_ just watching but also being paid and feel like i was cheating them.
I'm due to get a raise.
a couple of years.
I decided to steal a candy bar from the store.
Oh I think it was totally worth it! I got my favorite kind.
I was going to buy it but then I decided to buy one the next day. But for that day I wanted to just eat one right away.
My child hit their head really hard the other day_comma_ and caused the lip to split open. ugh 
yeah he is okay_comma_ but it was so scary. I freaked out when i seen blood. 
I heard a loud crash sound outside my house last night_comma_ I thought someone was trying to break in.
Well it turns out a bird flew into a window and died_comma_ pretty weird.
I'm so humbled by all the gifts we've received for our new baby... totally was not expecting it
Yes_comma_ we moved to a different state in the middle of my pregnancy and wasn't expecting much.
Today I am going to meet some old friends from school.
It is been ages since we see each other.  I hope I.m not that changed.
My son hit his first homerun last night.
I am so happy for him
I cant believe my daughter performed so well in the recital.
It was a dance recital_comma_ I am so happy.
I just moved out to the middle of nowhere. Sometimes when I'm home the loneliness gets tough.
That's a great idea. I should spend a little bit more time outside of the area as well.
Thank you for the advice_comma_ I'll take you up on that.
I barely passed my english class.
I talked all the time
I always like to eat at my favorite restaurant a few times a week and encourage others to in the hopes it can stay afloat.
oh they just seem to not be busy enough somedays
I was trying to cross over a fence but ended up tearing my jeans
Yea. A lot of people saw unfortunately.
Last week my mother passed away
I was not_comma_ I am so devestated
I went to church with a friend recently.
It was good_comma_ there were many people singing and stuff like that!
Yes I did.
My mom threw away my Nintendo_comma_ I was pissed.
No_comma_ I was away and found out when I got back.
Today I learned I was given a raise.  It was out of the blue_comma_ I was not expecting it.
Yes_comma_ indeed!  It is not the time of the year when raises happen.
My daughter has a cold today_comma_ so I'm taking care of her.
No_comma_ not too bad. She'll be fine in a few days.
I bought a new recliner last week_comma_ and I am so glad to have it.
It's crazy comfortable. It has a power headrest_comma_ so I can adjust it to fit me perfectly.
I just got a bunch of bills in.
 I am worried I wont have enough money to pay for them all
I went bungee jumping this last weekend for the first time.  I am not so good with heights.
I will probably not.  I have had enough nightmares since to make we want to go back
I recently went to a race at the local track
It was dirt track racing_comma_ I was astonished by the skill of these drivers
I can't wait for Halloween this year. I have so many ideas! I don't even know where to begin.
I know it's kind of early_comma_ but yeah_comma_ I'm already planning it out! I have a three year old now too_comma_ so he's finally old enough to actually realize what's going on and enjoy it as much as me.
Thanks! He loves costumes_comma_ so I think he'll have a great time.
Today I had a lot to do on my job_comma_ I thought I was never going to finish on time. But then a coworker helped me with it.
Yes! thanks to her help we were able to finish before the dateline!
I was at my local coffee shop this morning. I spaced out and ran into the door spilling coffee all over myself in front of the cute barista.
Guess I had work on my mind. I made myself look like an idiot. Im not sure I can return there. I feel dumb.
Someone asked me to come pick them up at a specific place at a specific time. I was a little busy at the time_comma_ but I relented. Then they sat there and took 30 minutes longer than they said they would_comma_ and I had to sit around waiting in the car. How are people that inconsiderate?
No_comma_ not an Uber driver. That'd be a little more understandable. It was just a friend who was running an errand and got stuck. Last time I do that for them any time soon.
It was kind of a halfway apology_comma_ something they did in a rush. Then they just carried on like normal. Oh well.
I am visiting my college kid soon!
Thank you_comma_ noone in my family has ever been educated past high school.
I'm happy with my health right now. I'm at a healthy weight_comma_ I have no aches or pain_comma_ and I'm still pretty young. I think young people take for granted their ability to not feel physical pain
Yeah_comma_ I'm just so focused on maintaining it_comma_ because both my brothers were in really great shape_comma_ and then all of a sudden once life caught up with them_comma_ with work and family_comma_ they got chubby. I don't want that to happen. We'll see how hard it will be to stop it
I like to wear my fathers watch that I inherited. Its a nice reminder of him.
It really makes me feel like he is right there with me sometimes.
I was trying to go a week without eating any sweets_comma_ to improve my eating habits. Didn't even make it three days before I started indulging. It gets nerve-wracking. Maybe I'm putting too much pressure on it.
Yeah_comma_ you have a point. Thanks. I know they say everything in moderation though_comma_ so I try to be sensible. But then I get mad at someone or something at work and it makes me just want to grab like three packs of M&M's
I'm very happy that summer is almost over and fall is around the corner.
I like the summer some_comma_ but really love the fall and winter.
The other day I was in a building and I was heading towards an elevator. I was rushing towards it because it was closing. I tripped right as I got in and slammed my head into the wall inside_comma_ and then had to hang out with everybody afterward as it slowly went up. Felt so dumb
I mean yeah_comma_ a little. People asked if I was okay_comma_ which was nice. But then it was silent after that_comma_ and you could kind of tell people were probably thinking that I felt embarrassed_comma_ which I did.
Yesterday I went to the garage to look for some tools and found a dead rat instead!
Yes_comma_ I hate rats! and it was already smelling really bad.
I'm doing a pretty good job balancing work and school right now. School is about to start up again_comma_ and I've managed to maintain my savings and pay off my student loans a little bit while still in school. I don't feel like a lot of other students can say that_comma_ and I'm happy
Yeah_comma_ but I'm glad I'm doing it this way_comma_ since it's kind of grounding me and teaching me the harder things I need to learn about not spending too much. I'm still drowning in student loan debt no matter how hard I try_comma_ though
I can start to see my mother showing early signs of dementia. I feel really helpless about it_comma_ since it shows how vulnerable they are. I try to help with small things_comma_ but it's sad knowing I won't be able to slow down the effects of it.
I heard that too! I try to do some of those here and there_comma_ but I get kind of tired of them after a while when I'm not successful. I'm really just dreading her getting much worse and not recognizing me_comma_ and having it seem like the past never happened. 
I just told a friend I couldn't attend her birthday because I have a headache_comma_ but the truth is I prefer to stay home and finish watching a series on Netflix.
Yes_comma_ but now I feel bad that I did that.
I thought I did poorly on a job interview. They called me today with an offer! It feels like it came out of nowhere since I wasnt expecting to hear back from them.
Thanks. Im blown away. I never expected to hear from them again.
I'm transferring to a new job and it's just beena  headache getting the paperwork done. I called my new boss to ask when I come into work_comma_ and they said they'd call me back. It's getting pretty late and I've been guarding my phone_comma_ but they still haven't called me back.
They've been obviously annoyed with me because I've had to finaggle them to get me transferred already. I hate to call again but I think I might have to.
I hate having to buy presents for other people.
I just don't know what I should buy. It makes me nervous.
Cool I didn't know that!
I ate at my favorite restaurant earlier and everything was tasted better than ever!
indeed some places go down hill with time but things turned out even better today
Making decent money with my new job_comma_ enough to afford to pay off all of my bills and put some into savings at the end of the month. I guess this is what it's like being an adult. Kind of weird to be on such a stable track for once
Well at the very least I'm not feeling worried_comma_ I guess. Can't ask for much more than that_comma_ when I know usually peers at my age are worried about student loans and all of that. So_comma_ I'm grateful
I was watching my kids soccer game last weekend. I was floored at how much they have improved. They are passing and challenging so much better.
Yeah my daughter wants to go pro one day. I think she has what it takes. She works so hard to improve her skills.
I found a baby kitten outside one day.
Yes_comma_ I took it to the local kitten farm.
While playing baseball with a few friends in my backyard_comma_ I knocked the ball over the fence and heard my neighbors window break. We all ran inside and acted like nothing happened.
I haven't heard from him yet. Maybe he doesn't know it was me? Gosh_comma_ I feel terrible now. I should probably have gone straight to him and offered to pay for it.
If I tell him it was me_comma_ I think things will be even worse now_comma_ since I didn't go right away. He'll know I considered not telling him!
My best friend took my daughter for the weekend so that I could have some alone time with my husband. 
She's awesome I'm so thankful for her. We are going out! To see a movie and to eat dinner!
My niece just grated from high school with honors!
Yes I am! And she is also a very talented athlete!
We've had so much rain lately. The ground got saturated and knocked some trees over. They took out a lot of my neighbors yard
Yeah they are fine_comma_ thank you. What's amazing is the tree removal service were on it immediately and got much of the debris up.
I ate at my favorite restaurant earlier and was feeling better than ever afterwards!
It's a tiny little thai place
My parents bought my wife and I a new dryer the other day. We had complained to them about our old one_comma_ and then a delivery guy showed up with the new one a week late. I was quite surprised!
Yeah_comma_ it was great_comma_ and totally unexpected. I feel very lucky to have parents like them!
I was going through a box with old papers in it and I found some old letter my Grandpa wrote me when I was a child. 
It did! He has since passed away so it made me really miss him. 
I have been studying all week for my upcoming Geometry test. I still feel like I am going to fail. I feel so unprepared.
Yeah maybe I am too worried. I will call my math genius friend to see if he can help me.
Family went out of town today. Since I start school soon_comma_ I couldn't go with them. House is empty_comma_ just hear some outside noises of passing cars and some birds. Feels a little like I was abandoned_comma_ even though no one had any other choice to do anything other than what they did. Oh well
That's not bad advice. Maybe I should do something to take my mind off things. And yeah_comma_ it will eventually. Nobody's fault_comma_ so I shouldn't be brooding
I just spent so much money on my car and now a week later something else broke. 
I honestly don't know where to get money to fix it_comma_ i'll probably try to fix it by myself
My husband and I recently decided we are going to get a puppy! I was really excited when I put the deposit down_comma_ but when I went to tell my mom about it she got really negative and talked badly about our decision. It was really frustrating and made me not feel great.
The dog breed we decided on is a rather large one and she was worried that we hadn't done our research. We have young children so she was concerned we didn't think about them first.
I was supposed to take a flight tomorrow_comma_ but there is supposed to be a storm at the time
Well I am more worry about not about the delay_comma_ but about flying with a storm around.
I was outside playing with my dogs today and felt wonderful enjoying the nice day!
yes playing with them is such a good time
I just had a nice lunch... i feel good
I had some chicken alfredo... now i feel like im ready for a nap
I tried Red Bull before skiing recently.
I was able to go about 1.7 the normal speed. It's like that stuff gave me wings or something.
Yea_comma_ I might start keeping them on hand anytime I do a sporting event!
Life is pretty good. I have a wonderful family_comma_ a good job_comma_ and a decent house. Can't complain!
Well I am not expecting anything else. Everything feels great for me now.
It was really cool to see that my old high school still looks the same. I had some great times there.
I havent seen it in about 10 years. I was visiting my parents and just seeing it really brought me back.
I stepped in some dog poop while taking a walk the other day_comma_ ugh.
I'm glad you were responsible_comma_ not everyone is!
My boyfriend recently made me a very nice meal while I worked late. I was so grateful.
It was very sweet. He actually cooks a lot but it was a day we were both very tired.
the toilet got clogged and there was poop everywhere_comma_ and I had to clean it up.
Yes! there was a bunch of coworkers watching me and laughing
I baked a bunch of cookies for my neighbors. Unfortunately I ate them all instead. I have no self control!
This happens way too often. I think I may need to find a 12 step program for my cookie addiction.
I went on a bunch of job interviews last week. I have a good feeling I will get an offer soon.
I really hope so. I felt I did well on a few of them. I guess we will see.
My mailman didn't make it by my house today and failed to deliver my order. He's usually never even late.
no I haven't called yet there's still time for him to make it by but it's a little odd to be sure. Nothing important at least!
I was flipping through looking at all my baby pictures.
They were! I was such a cute baby_comma_ I dont know what happened! lol
I just moved to a new city. i am looking forward to having a new start. 
Yes it is. im so optimistic that things will be better for me now that i took a chance and left my old life. 
I was walking down my street and a big fly flew into my mouth. I tried to spit it out but it wouldn't leave. It tasted so nasty.
Yeah it was a bit crunchy but I wasn't going to let it live rent-free in my mouth. At least I got my protein for the day!
My birthday is soon!
I plan to receive a present from my wife of this drone that I like.
She better!
I was walking home the other day_comma_ and ran into a stray dog. It chased me for quite a distance.
I climed over people's fences to get away from it_comma_ it finally lost me after a few of those.
I really really need that check to come_comma_ in the mail.
Yes its been about 4 weeks now
I just started a new job and I noticed a lot of the people gossip about each other. I'm not sure how long I can keep working here.
No not really. But especially at work. It makes things uncomfortable. 
I protect my little brother like my life depends on it_comma_ I have to
Yes hes about 5 years younger.
Guess what I got for my birthday!
I got lots and lots of presents!
I will never tell..
My mom has been out of town for weeks_comma_ I hope she comes back soon.
I hope so_comma_ She is always going on trips.
I was upset when my favorite TV show was canceled. Now I don't have anything to watch.
I will look but I hate it when they cancel good shows. It seems to happen too often.
I was driving home from work and a driver cut in front of me and made me almost hit another car.
I flipped a lot of birds and spewed some pretty angry words too. People drive so stupid sometimes. 
My teacher said If i do what she says she can guarantee ill pass
Thats right_comma_ I am very greatfull for that indeed.
Today was the day I had been practicing for years for.
I did amazing_comma_ I know I did_comma_ I had to
I went a bunch of job interviews last week. I have a good feeling that I will land something soon.
I feel like I did. I should hear something soon.
I was at the store the other day and I didn't notice when my wallet fell on the ground. Luckily a man picked it up and found me! I was so happy!
It was so reassuring to know that there are still good people in this world
I cant believe it_comma_ 3rd try and stilla  fail.
my college entrance exam_comma_ again.
Sometimes my daughters have too much homework.
Yes_comma_ but there's not enough time in the day for all we do.
I spent a ton of money on computer upgrades and purchasing a new game I was excited for. Turns out it's actually pretty boring.
Yeah. While I'm pretty bummed out_comma_ the only wasted money was on the game. It's always nice to have a power and fast computer.
That's awesome! So you're a gamer as well?
So I had really good job interview. They just called to say they went with someone else. Im a little bummed about that.
I do but I was really hoping I got that one.
Recently I had a shift at work cancelled. Often that can mean that the rest of the week gets cancelled.
Sometimes it is nice but loss of pay for 20+ hours definitely made me a little nervous. Thankfully only the one was cancelled.
I was at the mall the other day and I smelled some cinnamon rolls. It reminded me of my childhood and was such a good time!
It was! I bought 2!
I finally saved up enough money to take a trip to Alaska to see the northern lights.
In October. I have been waiting so long. I cant wait!!!
I was talking crap to this guy for like 10 minutes and he all of a sudden just knocks me out
hahah thats right_comma_ I guess I learned the hard way.
Even if I were filthy rich I would have no problem ordering McDonald's at a drive-thru.  I'm a man of simple taste
Well good for you buddy
I gor home from work the other day to find my cat had peed on the carpet. The smell was horrible.
It really is. Luckily_comma_ I had some cleaner for pet urine_comma_ but I was gagging the whole time I was cleaning.
The ride I was going on went upside downs three times in total.
no I was scared out of my witts!
My life is going pretty well at this time.
No_comma_ and that's why it's pretty good.
I got in a wreck today. Someone cut me off on a wet road and slammed their brakes causing me to wreck. It makes me furious someone can drive so dangerously.
Yea enough to have it get fixed. I was so mad. I had a big meeting at work that I had to miss.
I dropped my allstart team trophy and it shattered everywhere
some sort of ceramic material.
I was laying in my bed last night and I heard footsteps walking down the hall. I was frightened because I live alone.
Yeah I looked but didn't see anything. I did some research on my home and it turns out there are no records of it being built. Now I am terrified.
I finally made the full climb_comma_ I mastered to cargo rope.
Maybe 30 minutes or so_comma_ for my first try
I am going to see a band that i have wanted to see for a long time.
Postmodern Jukebox
I thought my son was doing good in school. When I got his report card I found out he failed his math class. I wish he had told me he was in trouble.
He was ashamed but I told him I was only upset he didn't tell me. I know how hard it is to admit failure.
"I've been working at my job for several years and I'm very comfortable here. 
Not especially. Also_comma_ I feel bad for getting so comfortable here because this is really not where I want to spend most of my career.
I was all alone in my house and I heard something in my living room.
It sounded like something breaking. I wasnt sure what to do.
This year has been going pretty good so far.
Not so much. Just the fact that I still have my job and everything is going just as good.
I packed my bag in advance_comma_ and really thoroughly_comma_ when I went to the hospital to have my baby.
I was so happy that for once_comma_ I didn't forget or miss anything
Let me tell you something_comma_ i never win anything but yesterday i won 75$ in a lotery! i know it's not much but i felt so lucky
that's why i was so surprised when i saw i won some money. i kept checking to see if it's really true
I work in finance and just got a raise and new office.
Yeah I'm so happy!
I haven't been liking the hot weather lately.
I'll be glad when Fall arrives.
MY neighbors have been really nice since my car broke down
they are letting my kids carpool to school. I will help them out when my car is fixed
Two weels
Last week I baked a cake for my kid's birthday party. Somehow the dog jumped on the table and started scarfing it down. I was furious with him.
Yeah I made him go outside and didn't give him any dog treats for a while. Luckily I had enough ingredients to make another cake.
I rip on my friends and make mean jokes about them alot.  But that doesn't mean I hate them in fact I look out for them like they are my brothers
Yes we all do lol.  It's all love
I'm really good at my job. My boss can always count on me. 
I work in sales. I'm a great closer. 
I am making my wife dinner with this new rub I bought for the chicken.  It
Yeah it's got coffee grounds in it... I'm pretty sure she's gonna hate it though.  Wish me luck!
I got a new phone a few weeks ago.
It's an iphone.  It's sooooo much faster than my old one!
ITs almost my birthday
MY boyfriend says he has a surprise for me. I am so excited.
Me too! I don't want a party or anything just something I know he really thought about
I was at a gas station with my friend and we both bought a lottery ticket. She won a little bit of money! I was a little mad that I didn't get anything.
I feel as if that is the way with me. I never win anything!
I just saw the most gross and disturbing thing running down the street. It was a backed old man.
No a naked old man. It was so gross.
I'm pretty stoked because I'm putting together this business idea in my head.  If done right with my friend we could rake in a ton of cash
It involves splitting up some freelancing work and maximizing productivity.
My boss was diagnosed with cancer earlier this summer. I've been trying very hard to work extra to make things easier for her.
We are very confident she will! Thankfully they caught it early_comma_ but the treatment is just really difficult.
That is wonderful! Luckily for her_comma_ because of her chemo site she won't loose her hair. 
Thank you! 
I really miss watching Saturday morning cartoons
I don't really know. It just reminds of when life was easier.
I tripped and fell in front of the cute barista yesterday. I dont feel like showing my face there again.
I dont know. I usually see the same workers there. Im sure they got a good laugh at my expense.
I quit my job recently_comma_ which was great. But I didn't have time to tell my good friend before leaving. I feel so bad now.
Well she sent me an email checking in. And I responded but I think it filtered to her junk mail_comma_ she hasn't responded back.
I couldn't believe it when I saw my dog had jumped in my baby's crib. I don't know how he got up there.
He was just licking her and she was laughing. I guess I need to look at moving the crib somewhere the dog can't get to.
I was on my way home and I saw a little cat! It was so cute I just had to take care of it
I did! I also posted around to see if it was anyone's. Nobody has responded yet
It sucks seeing others make more money than me.
That's true but social media makes it hard to be okay with my best. 
I thought my job interview went well last week but I just found out I didn't get the job.
Yea I was a little bummed out.
I won a bet for $50 I had forgotten all about.
Nope_comma_ put it all in the bank.  Saving for a house.
Yep_comma_ Gotta love honest friends.  
I have been talking to this girl that I like for awhile now.  I think that I am finally going to ask her on a date
I think she will.  We have been having good conversations.  IM going to do it tonight!
I was at the store and I dropped my wallet without knowing. Luckily some nice man gave it to me later in the trip! I was so surprised!
It is! That has never happened to me before!
I just ordered delivery from a new vegan restaurant
It hasn't come yet. I'm not vegan but I've been told its really good so I can't wait
It's new so I'm branching out. Cant live off of burgersa and fries lol
I had to give a speech in front of a few people I have never met. I was a little scared
It was about a new idea I had about work
It went ok
My friend is pretty smart and reliable.  I think I'd have enough faith to go into business with him
I wouldn't trust all my friends with this role.  But dude's got a clean record_comma_ no kids or nagging baby momma and he's pretty financially stable haha
My girlfriend was cheating on me and I didn't know. 
She left me. I believed she would never cheat on me until she told me she was dating another guy

My cat just died. I have had her for like 20 years.
Yeah  had to put her down because she was in so much pain. I don't know what to do without her.
Looking back at my older self I've come a long way.  It's pretty amazing really_comma_ I was such a bum now I'm a real man_comma_ living on my own self-employed with my own car paying my own bills. Like waking up from a nightmare haha
Yes a lot more than back then for sure.  Still striving for better every day though
I was at a cell phone store last week talking to a girl who worked there and she was telling me a lot about her life.
Yes it actually was because it turns out she manages that location and has managed another location as well. So she has that experience.
Even more awesome is that she is only 22 years old_comma_ I was highly impressed_comma_ but she must have been at the right place at the right time!
I stepped in bubble gum in the parking lot at work.
Some people just have no common courtsey.
I watch youtube videos all day because I'm so bored

She really does and I'm so happy she is following her dream to become a doctor.
We were all so proud of my nephew the other day
He got his first credit card the other day. He has a Limit of $300 
I was shocked a couple of days ago when I made over $100 without even trying.  But then I remembered money is just energy and flows to whoever is open to it
That's right you're getting it!
I had a job interview recently and I think I did great. I am pretty sure I will get the job.
Yeah I just know I will get a call any minute now with a job offer!
I really like my friend's Chanel bag_comma_ but I would never spend that much money on an accessory

The neighbor was teasing him.
My neighbor just purchased my dream car and parks it in his driveway everyday.  I feel like the car is taunting me.

I forgot to make my student loan payment this month.
I'm scared it will affect my credit score.
i was pissed when i saw someone put a dent in my door
they didnt leave a note_comma_ just a dent :(
I should really stop expecting so much from people in this game. I get a good partner convo going_comma_ thinking that every conversation will be the same...then I get some idiot and lose all hope in humanity

I'm been preparing my lunches with a bit more effort for the last couple of months_comma_ and I'm noticing some weight loss because I've been taking extra effort in making them.

"I have been working to lose weight for 4 months now and just weighed myself! I'm 30 pounds down!

it was impressive seeing a guy eat a 3 lbs burger the other day
yea 
I'm sad when  I use a clever one-liner from old pop lyrics...and it goes right over people's heads..waste of genius really
Right_comma_ some guy was complaining about how this old playground he used to play at was being renovated...and I said "don't it always seem to gooo.." and the counting crows reference just went up in flames
You've restored my hope in humanity.
My family is always bugging me to do things that I dont have time to do. Yesterday they wanted me to stop my work day_comma_ come home_comma_ and go to the old folks home to visit my grandma when i already go every weekend.

I am but it feels even better knowing I don't need to stress over my luggage.
I stole a sandwich from one of my students. 
I took it from his lunchbox.  I feel so guilty for doing that.
My parents raised me like a king and I'm thankful for that.  Because although I was introverted for most of my life I was pretty confident and successful in my abilities and always did well no matter what I did
I sure didn't do it on my own...well I did but if I was raised horribly I know I wouldn't be the man I am today.
I have so many ants in my kitchen_comma_ no matter what I do_comma_ I can't get rid of them and they are everywhere.

Not as unfortunate as what I just heard but thanks. I had to run home and take a shower right away. Now I walk around with an umbrella!

It was the only weekend we were all off together.

I finding it difficult to say no. He is putting pressure on me. So I can't say no.

I went on a date tonight. I was a little upset with how it turned out
They were just not nice and did not want anything to do with me

I am! I am pretty darn hopeful that I am going to crush this interview.
My neighbors drive me crazy and they're so weird. The bring huge Cloud chairs onto their tiny front stoop and lay back side by side together. It looks like they might fall off if they move at all.
They also sit out on the busy road by the curb and play the trombone.  Its almost like some crazy reality show. ha ha.
This mexican place now has a bakery. Can't wait to try some Mexican sweets

I don't know if you have a group like this_comma_ but I've got a group of lady friends that I get together with about once a week.

my pants dropped last week from getting hooked on a table
yea i was so mad at myself
I was on my way home last night when a large speeding truck came flying under a red light as I passed under it. Damn near nailed me!
I was shaking after it happened. I nearly had to pull over on the side of the road just to calm down.
I'm still a bit nervous about driving under lights too. It's a shame how people drive these days.
My girlfriend at the time seemed to be so much more passionate when talking to one of her friends.
She just seemed to be so much more energetic and engaged when she was talking to him.

yea i was so mad
i have a box of baby stuff from my twins that i have kept since they have been babies. they are 25 now

I went through the drive thru at a fast food place_comma_ and the cashier would not give me a receipt!
That's what I did actually. The manager was apologizing to me. It was just frustrating.
Recently I knew that my friends were going on a trip and I really wanted to go.
At first I thought that there wasn't enough room_comma_ but then there was!
I was outside playing with my dogs earlier. Throwing the ball around_comma_ they got so playful and ran around as fast as they could!
They are the best! Cats are also great though
my cat vomited on my rug today
not sure but it was really horrible
When I was pretty young_comma_ I witnessed my cousin fall and break her arm. It was completely disfigured and bent in odd ways. It grossed me out so bad I nearly vomitted.
Good thing she had no permanent damage though. But that memory is scarred into my brain!
I really do not like being around rats_comma_ they scare me.
I once was in an elevator and a rat was in there. I thought I was going to have a heart attack.

The venom that can kill worries me the most.
My husband is out of town for work. This sucks

I know that I will be the youngest billionaire ever.
I am starting a business.
Have you noticed the trends with engagement proposals and save the date YouTube videos?  I find them to be so romantic.
No and have no intentions of getting married.  However_comma_ I don't have any problems with celebrating with those who make that choice.  
They have become really creative with the videos where they are almost like watching a movie.  You should check them out sometimes.  Are you married?
A storm came through earlier and lightning struck very close by and the power went out! I was worried as sometimes the power can go out for days but luckily it came back on an hour later this time.

I felt so bad when I got home from work because I saw a huge mustard stain on my shirt!
Yes! I couldn't believe that none of my coworkers were willing to let me know about it.
My friend was quite the nobody until he got a job and a girlfriend seemingly out of nowhere!
I guess he just decided to get his life in order and it worked so well for him!
My friend used to be such a nobody until he got a job and girlfriend out of nowhere!
Absolutely_comma_ I'm glad that he is happy!
I am so ready for the Life Is Beautiful Music Festival
It is a music festival in Las Vegas.
I pray that America will be great again.
Yes_comma_ and I am worried Trump won't win reelection.
My grandmother is in the hospital after being in a car accident. The doctors are taking good care of her so I feel she is in good hands.
Yes_comma_ she is a strong woman and I am confident that she will recover well.
I swear as I get older I need to take my time in getting dress. I'm afraid I'm going to be on one of those Walmart meme.  I've left home and before you know it I realize I have something on wrong.
Funny you say that.  I just told my mom she needs to pick out her clothes for the week and church on Sundays to avoid being frustrated.  I think I should take my own advice.
That's interesting.  I usually don't have too much issues getting dressed.  Just on very rare occasions_comma_ I have left home with 2 different pairs of shoes_comma_ but at least on the right feet.
I am embarrassed that I skipped school to go to the concert.
Yes but now I have detention for a month.

I was mad at the owner for not paying me for my work.
My partner took my car last Sunday morning to visit her friend. She did not even ask me or let me know. I had plans too with friends. And I was stuck at home
I did. But she does not listen to my concerns at all. She lives like she is the only one in that house
I recently was worried about a job interview even though I think it went well. I hope I get it.

At one point last semester_comma_ I realized I really needed a B in one my classes to get the GPA I wanted!
Yep! I knew that if I studied like I did that I could do well!

I always keep my word to my children.
Yes_comma_ I have to teach them right.
My brother is in the Navy.
He has been there for five years.
Do you have a favorite music era?
That's a great era!  I went through a rock n roll phase around 1984-1986.  My favorite music era is the 70s.  I love the bands. Old school music is the best for me.
I'm a 70's baby not old at all but I find myself longing for my childhood days.  They were the best of days even in the world.
Anytime I hear Hillary Clinton talk_comma_ I feel sick to my stomach.
I love Trump_comma_ I could listen to him speak all day.
I've long been married and living on my own_comma_ but my mom still cooks up delicious meals almost every night and invites me over to eat. I appreciate that more than she realizes.
I usually go and visit her_comma_ but she does come over pretty often too. We have a close relationship. I really have a lot to thank her for.
That's a great idea! I do enjoy cooking. I learned from her and my grandmother. I'm from the South so we know how to cook delicious cajun cuisine!
I really wanted to get an A in one of my classes but I barely didn't which is fine.
It was physics_comma_ which is my least favorite subject.
I won the lottery_comma_ its party time.

I have to agree that they usually are a waste of money. But this time I'm happy I bought it! Made back some of the money I wasted in the past.
I'll definitely take that advice! I think I'll stop after this one.
I recently applied for a new credit card with Chase. My application was approved and i was given $8_comma_400 credit line. To be honest_comma_ with my low credit score_comma_ i was pretty surprised to be given this amount
That is what I am talking about. From my other cards_comma_ I only have $3_comma_000. How come with my low credit score I was granted such amount. It was just unbelievable for me

I am so sad about the bridge collapsing.
This occurred in Italy last night.
I really wish they would do more in the schools to stop children from being intimidated by others so they can focus on what's important.
I'm not sure about all_comma_ but I do see a rise in those being home schooled to ensure the safety of the children.  However_comma_ not all parents are equipped with the ability to home school. 
That's interesting.  I wonder if the teacher's salary would be impacted by implementing your idea.  It's already a challenge to pay teachers what they deserved.  I think that good home training is necessary so that the child will know how to act when they are at school.
I tried a new taco place in town yesterday and I really liked it!
Yeah they also have burritos_comma_ tamales_comma_ and lots of other yummy stuff.

I am amazed that no one died in the plane crash.
The one that occurred in the Alps last year.
My co worker is always sucking up to the boss and doing good work. I think he is trying to get promoted. 
Well_comma_ I do my work as well as I can. But he just seems like he's trying to be better than everyone else.
I am so ready for my birthday party.
Mine is July 1st. Did you have a party for them?
It's feel so strange going from a household of 8 and now down to 5 with 2 almost ready to leave.  My youngest just started high school. I imagine 4 more years and it will be just me.
Definitely_comma_ you have a good point there.  I love my peaceful moments.  I just have very brief moments when I think of them all at home.

i cant wait. im taking my mother with me too. he will love it im sure
A bird crashed right into my window today.
A bluejay I believe. No_comma_ it died on impact unfortunately.
No the window was fine thankfully. Just gave me quite the startle.
I was driving and saw this guy dumping garbage on the side of the freeway.
Nah_comma_ I was hoping a police officer could deal with how gross and wrong it is to do something like that.
my brother moved out of state 6 months ago for work and randomly showed up yesterday at my moms house_comma_ unannounced for a visit!
we were all very happy. even tho i talk to him every day_comma_ it was awesome seeing him
I am really into giving and receiving good customer service.  It's something about excellent customer service that really makes a different in your day.
You definitely got a point there.  I know we all have our bad days but that does not give you a right to take it out on someone that is trying to patronize your business.  I have my favorite companies I buy from just to make sure that I leave away with a happy experience every time.  What about you?
I'm going to watch a film this weekend_comma_ but I am not sure if I will like it.

My best friend unexpectedly gave me a gift the other day. I was very appreciative of their gesture.
She actually made the gift herself. I really liked it a lot.
I did not get to go to out with my friends last night
I was too busy so I had to stay home instead
We separated and she now  remarried 
I was full of surprise 
Thanks For the advice 
I am expecting a call from the doctor any day now. I am super nervous about it.
Yes_comma_ and it could potentially be serious. I don't know what I will do if it goes bad.
I went backpacking a week ago
I did a bit of the Appalachian Trail. Luckily_comma_ I had over-prepared as my flashlight had broken and it would have been difficult if I didn't have a spare

I am so trying to find a creative way to make my son remember to take out the trash.  I'm wondering if it's just a man thing_comma_ a generational thing because I remember hearing my grandmother and my mom fuss about it.  Now it is my turn and I'm so over it.
Well_comma_ he's 20 almost 21 now and I thought that as he grew older it would become automatic.  I don't want his potential wife to be frustrated by what should be automatic.  
can you imagine how that made me feel
I was siiting beside a girl on the transit bus and she expelled gas and it stunk so bad that the person on the other side of her vomited _comma_5 minutes later she had the nerve to try and flirt with me and tried to get my phone number.

My boss has been giving me hours I really want lately.
They definitely like me there.
Everyone does get along well.
So when I was younger_comma_ my aunt lived in California. We lived on the East Coast. My aunt invited my sister out to see her.
Exactly. Even though I was just a little younger_comma_ I didn't get to go_comma_ too.

Yes they do. In a way I'm grateful because it is peaceful.
My manager is wasting my time with stuff that is not related with work. I can not make progress in my work.
I am having the same issue. Then my manager is asking me to respect deadlines.
I was helping my sister to look for her card_comma_ even though I knew she wasn't going to find it 
It was her credit card_comma_ I borrowed it without telling her
I wanted to purchase something and I did not have any money_comma_ so I used her card.
My son ran over my neighbor's cat on accident the other day. He's only 16_comma_ learning to drive still. I think my neighbor is going to try to get physically abusive with him. Not sure what to do
We think he might have some sort of mental illness. He doesn't really want to listen to reason. I'm a single mother_comma_ can't exactly physically intervene in this situation with the best of results. Don't have any family I can call to have them come around either. Can't exactly have the police on-call for something that hasn't happened yet. Don't know what t do!
My mom made a chocolate cake the other day and it reminded me of the one I had at my 8th birthday party.
I agree_comma_ it really took me back.
Really tired of the person in my life continuing to repeat the same mistakes.
I have no idea..but they have behaved as if they would in the past and never stuck too it! I don't know how much more I can take of this.
I was overcharged on my water bill by 200%_comma_ during a time I was on an especially tight budget.
Yeah_comma_ they admitted it was a problem on their end and reversed the charge.  I had to waste literally hours on the phone with them!
Really sick of going through the same thing with a person who is in my life.
yes_comma_ I have. They have been thrown out..and they have to change to ever even get a moment from me..However...I let them back in for a second and they did the same crap again... It's making me quite angry when they lie to me.
I was really excited to see that an ex coworker of mine moved back to town as was working with me once again. 
Yea! They had moved away to take care of a sick relative_comma_ but the relative was doing much better and they missed being here so they came back.
I recently changed jobs for a better opportunity with more pay. I'm very pleased with the new job_comma_ but I did feel bummed about leaving my former co-workers behind. We had a good time and I liked those kids.
Oh yeah_comma_ it's been good so far. Plus_comma_ we have social media to keep in touch.
My cat jumped up on the mantle and destroyed my mothers old vase. I am so distraught because that vase is over 50 years old.
It broke apart into many pieces. Its been in the family for so long.

I don't drink lol. I was VERY exhausted. I have fibro so every move can hurt. I just didn't care and I always care..but was in too much pain! I should've done it anyway though
The medicine is very dangerous generally. I am just trying to figure it out with herbs and diet :) Some days are worse then others.
I start a new job tomorrow. I'm feeling really good about it.
Can't wait. I hated my old job so much. Nothing can be worse than the managment at that old place.
ME TOO :D
I am getting a motorcycle tomorrow since I just finished my motorcycle endorsement class! I feel really good about hitting the road!
I just bought it and pick it up tomorrow!  I finally feel comfortable enough with my skills to drive on the roads!

Seeing my momma dogs newborn puppy grow everyday is sooo precious!
Sorry? What does that have to do with my momma dog?
Your conversations are not making any sense. Please stay on the subject.
"I am so appreciative of how tight knit me and my friends are as a group.
The most unfortunate part is as you get older you tend to have more distance between you and your friends just because of college and job locations. I try to communicate through text or calls as often as I can
I woke up this morning and found my truck had a flat tire.
Not sure I just aired it up then I had to jet to work.  I've got a small compressor. I'll deal with it later.

My partner is being a big fat jerk.
What does that have to do with what I said??? I really don't think I can deal with his childish crap anymore and lies.

my favort team won the foot ball macth
I was very positively surprised by the work made by a co-worker.

I spent hours yesterday going through old photos from my childhood.
Yes_comma_ it did. I felt so nostalgic because I remembered those wonderful days_comma_
I fell asleep at my friend's house and they shaved half my beard off of my face while I was sleeping. Now I look stupid and have to shave it all off! I've had one for the past 10 years. So stupid
Yeah_comma_ but I had been growing it for a long time! And I feel like my face looks so stupid without one.. I guess I only have to wait a few weeks before I at least get a little coverage. But more importantly_comma_ not sure if I want to hang out with these people anymore_comma_ and I don't know if I'm overreacting
It could be.. These are guys I've known since high school. Unfortunately_comma_ they haven't really grown up since then.
My sister threw a party for me a few months ago.
My bridal shower. I thought I was just going over to have dinner there.

My friend just bought a really nice house that he can barely afford.
Ah it's no big deal.  I'm super happy with my humble dwellings.
My bag split open at a coffee shop other day. Everything dropped loudly onto the floor.
No_comma_ I just had to pick it all up and... obviously I ran out as fast as I could.
My friend gave me flowers and chocolate
No it wasn't and I wasn't expecting it because we are just mutual friends.
Yes_comma_ and that day I was feeling rather sad. It cheered me up.
Lately_comma_ I've been feeling enthusiastic that I have good things coming my way. I'm a Christian_comma_ and I've been praying about it a lot.

Did I tell you about the time I lost my wallet.

I was so proud this morning when  my little boy got on the bus with no problems.
He is 5 years old.
He is starting kindergarten this year.
My friend was sick the other day and I made her soup.
It is my trademark... Cream of celery... It is sooo much better than the canned stuff.
So my husband left yesterday on a work trip_comma_ and I miss him a lot more than I thought I would.
He will when he gets time I think. I thought I'd enjoy the time alone_comma_ but I'm just lonely.
One of my cowokers is always talking to me about stuff that is not related to work. I can't make progress in my work.
We have the same manager. I don't want to make trouble. I need to find a way to tell her nicely.
I've been trying to lose weight for a while but I think I've finally gotten to where I can make lunches that are healthy but I still want to eat_comma_ and I don't feel like I'm starving literally all the time.
I've never tried Keto_comma_ but my roommate actually is on a keto diet and it's been doing very good for him. And for lunches I like wraps a lot since you can change up what you put in them but they're never going to be that bad of a lunch.
When I found out I was betrayed..it was like being shot in the stomach...there is almost no worse feeling besides losing someone
My partner. He has impulse control issues...and there is just nothing worse...especially coming from someone you love!

Yeah_comma_ and it doesn't help that the news seems to be reporting on plane accidents all the time!
I walked around the mall for 2 hours with my fly down.

Over 20 years ago_comma_ when I was a cashier_comma_ I used to take money from the cash register and cover up my tracks. I was never caught. Sometimes I feel bad about it_comma_ other times I don't
Well_comma_ it was just a minimum wage job that I was working as a young punk kid trying to make some spending money during the summer. I just didn't take it or myself seriously_comma_ and didn't really think about repercussions. One of the only reasons I feel bad is that the owner of the store was a nice person

My dog has to go stay at the doggie daycare for a couple of days so I can go to a wedding. Im scared that she will think I am leaving her there and never coming back and I dont want her to feel that way.
I know I just wish I knew if she could understand what I am saying to her. No I have never left this one before_comma_ shes 3 years old. I know it would be better if someone she knew could watch her but I couldn't find anyone.
My son is in his last year of high school.

My brother took SAT test lately and received 2000 as his final score. I was very surprised and was not expecting it from him at all
Generally_comma_ he is not that much an attentive person. And for him to receive such a high score is quite unusual
Overtly superficial people tick me off.  They're nice to you in person but talk crap behind your back that's what you call a two-faced friend
Yup exactly.  Especially when you're keeping it real.  The least you could do is return the favor

Many years ago_comma_ I fell in love with a beautiful woman with whom I was totally entranced. We were together for about three months_comma_ then she suddenly cut things off. She had told me she loved me. But in our final conversation_comma_ she denied ever having said so.

No_comma_ never. I

I robbed my grand parents once because of my addiction to drugs. They didn't notice but I feel bad about it.
I still have issues with my addiction. I didn't get rid of it even with help. It is a terrible thing to leave with.
I'm scared to show love or get close in a relationship. I once mistook pity and infatuation for love and ended up being miserable. Am I gonna let that happen again? Hell no

Yes one was a $1000 TV. I am beyond devastated because I worked hard to afford it.
For some dumb reason I used to think that hobos were mystical and wise and believe everything they said...now I take everything I hear from a person broker than me with a grain of salt
I never said they were dumb.  I just don't trust them
I've been calling my coworker the wrong name for the past three months. They finally decided to say something about it today. The worst part is I wasn't even close with the name I had been calling them. They're so nice and I felt so bad
That's a funny way to put it. Yeah the problem was I just got introduced to so many people at once_comma_ and it was my first day_comma_ so I was nervous and wasn't really paying attention. Eventually learned them all again over time_comma_ but I guess that one got lost in translation somehow. They were cool about it though
I was at the store and I saw a 5$ bill on the ground_comma_ I was so happy!
No_comma_ it was tucked under one of the shelves in an empty aisle
I am so pleased with the way things are right now.

I feel bad I didn't get as much accomplished in the past week as I should!
True but it's only me here. I have fibro and I work a lot and frankly even to move my hand has been painful_comma_ so it's hard.
I FINALLY get my lawn mower fixed on thursday.
This time yes_comma_ you can get good priced parts online.  I am strangely excited to use it and have my yard nice again!
I have a three month trip planned starting in September. I have been counting down the days until I leave.
I am going all over Europe. I got my route planned and everything. I cannot wait to leave.
I am always the man and I repeat it as a mantra. When someone tries to get me down I just harden up and remember that I'm probably smarter and tougher than them.  Because I'm a M*****N BAWSSS

I just came to college and have no friends in my dorm and no one to eat with.
Yes I think I will have to do that because I don't want to feel lonely and cry in my room all day. 
I am confident in my own judgment.  Because I am not just a man---I am THE MAN like that 50 cent song...I'm not perfect but I'm always confident that no matter what I do_comma_ the only person who knows what's best for me is ME and no one else
Nope because trusting people has gotten me mugged_comma_ stabbed_comma_ heartbroken_comma_ robbed_comma_ and rendered homeless.  Every since trusting myself I've become fully self employed_comma_ make 1200 a week_comma_ drive my own car pay my own bills and find time to hit the gym 6 days a week.  So life's pretty gravy tbh
There has been this sinkhole in my yard since the hurricane hit last year and it is the cities responsibility to take care of it. I called it in about a week after the hurricane and it is almost a year since then. Yesterday someone came out and marked it with flags and Im certain that means they will begin to work on it soon.

Not a drinker ;) lol. But I will feel accomplished. I would pop a piece of sugar really lol
People...No way! I will gorge myself and eat in_comma_ in front of my favorite show :)
I went home over the weekend to hang out with some old high school friends and things got a little crazy
my ex wanted to do some stuff_comma_ but my wife wouldve been mad about that
I am figuring out my health issues_comma_ I feel through lots of research_comma_ I can fix it. I am getting things solved and finally feeling better.
I know right! It can be very complicated to figure it out. I got very sick during pregnancy...and doctors messed me up SO badly..I am finally chipping away at what they did and getting better. Slowly but surely. Amazing what herbs and organic stuff can do..and also frightening what other things and chemicals can ruin
I was on a scientific mission to mars when a massive sand storm hit.
The only person stopping you from realizing your dreams is you. But yeah my crew thought I was dead_comma_ and they left me behind. Really sucked
Never did get back.  Figured I'd hang out here and start a coffee roasting business.  I'll be the only one_comma_ so success seems likely.
My dog has cancer.
I guess not because the surgery didn't work so we have to put her down.
My neighbor was robbed at home last week.  Since then_comma_ she has been too scared to stay by herself.  We let her stay with us for a couple of nights.
She was a nervous wreck and we felt like it was a good idea for her to have some friends around for a while.
i was upset when i had to miss my son's game
i wasnt able to get out of work on time due to being way too much work
My mommy dog does not want to leave her cage even to go potty. 
Can't pick her up with how low the cage is and how big she is_comma_ I just have to pull her out- She goes to the back of the cage. It's getting on my nerve a bit to have to take all my strength to drag her out everyday. Phew :( Good for my arm muscles I guess
Nope- She has a baby in there.She does not want to go- She fights me the whole time. So frustrating.
I went out to eat at what used to be my favorite restaurant last weekend.
This time the service was terrible and the food was gross. It was recently taken over by new management. 
My car was stolen last night!
No and the police have no leads. They are worthless
I was cleaning out some old boxes after moving and found pictures from my prom
Yea_comma_ I messaged my ex and we were talking about those times.  It was crazy talking about those old times
It made me miss her...
I was a dog on the side of the road that got hit by a car_comma_ and I was so sad
I was_comma_ I just hope that it was a stray rather than somebody's pet
I was walking home one night and I saw some guy standing next to a wall_comma_ luckily he didn't have any bad intentions. I was freaked out
I was walking home from the store it wasnt far but I spent some time in it
My daughter was in a ballet recital. She danced so beautifully. I was so impressed. 
They looked so nice. And it was in a real theater so it seemed so professional. 
I ordered a meal from a restaurant yesterday and it had a hair in it!
I did_comma_ they took it back and gave me another plate and it was free
My mother died last night my friend. I am pretty out of it right now.
That is quite a interesting statement hmmm.
My best friend is moving far away.
I am going to be so miserable
I went on a 4 hour roadtrip the other day and i hate when people play on their phone when I am driving
Yea_comma_ if im focusing on driving_comma_ i need someone else to keep me company.  its like when someone sleeps when you are driving
I just applied for a job.
Yeah_comma_ I'm really nervous that they won't hire me. 
I will try.
I felt bad because I was texting with my ex the other day
I do_comma_ I didnt want her getting mad. Especially since I really enjoyed talking to my ex again.
Thats not a bad idea :)
it was supring to see a guy eat a 3 lbs burger the other day
yes and he got a free shirt
Last week I was at the park with my kid and got distracted by my phone. I looked up and my daughter was gone! My stomach dropped and became really scared. Luckily I found her in the tube slide.
I feel fine and have definitely learned my lesson.
I was walking down the street and I found a 20$ bill! I was so happy
It was just sitting in the grass_comma_ what am I supposed to do?
I need that money at the moment_comma_ plus I donate on the regular
My brother just asked me to be his best man. I'm so psyched!
Thanks! I can't wait for the bachelor party!
My friend wants me to go hiking with him this weekend on some sort of scary trail where there's thin walking trails along some dangerous ledges... Not really my thing_comma_ but he's been kind of lonely recently
Yeah_comma_ I hope so. I have a fear of heights and I'm not much of an outdoors person. But I'm afraid of losing another friend by continuously declining to go out and hang out with them. I'm determined to change that_comma_ since I've lost a bunch of them in the past like that
Going to see my long distance girlfriend this weekend_comma_ and we're going to have a movie marathon. I only get to see her every so often because of the distance. I'm excited
Haha_comma_ yeah it's rough sometimes. We live like a thousand miles almost exactly apart. So_comma_ we only get to see each other a few times a year. But when we do_comma_ it's great. really adds to the excitement of everything
i knew i shouldnt have left my dog with my brother
my dog ran away
I was at the store and this guy was carrying 20 bags! It was amazing!
This guy looked so unathletic yet he was so strong
My neighbor passed away a few days ago. She was a nice older lady who'd always greet me when I saw her in the hall. Didn't know her that well_comma_ but she seemed lonely. I feel kind of bad for not getting to know her better when she was still alive
I know! I think she was just a widow and most of her friends had passed away_comma_ or something. I felt like I should have gotten closer to her_comma_ but I also didn't want to intrude. I don't know_comma_ that's probably just a lame excuse. It would have been easy enough for me to do
I am so excited! I am going to Hawaii next week
I cant wait to go.  I started packing already 
My new cat wont stop knocking over the plates from the counter top
It is! I have to clean it up afterwards so I really need to start training her more.
I never win anything cool :(
my friend at work won a free trip that we were both going for.  i really wanted to win
I'm really gullible. I used to believe that a magician could pull coins out of my ears.
It was six months ago. I will believe anything. 
I have been in a relationship for a few years and its alright but its nothing terribly special
Im fine with it_comma_ it could be a lot worse
my brother is doing so well at his rehab. i'm so proud of him
he was able to stand for the first time today. i'm so happy
he went from being dead for 28 minutes to standing on his own today. i could moonwalk
Last weekend I had a plan to go to the springs with a couple of my friends and camp out. We ended up not going at all because the weather got really bad. I was really upset because everyone took off work and we probably wont be able to all get together like that again this summer.
Yeah. I should have thought ahead more about the weather_comma_ I didnt think it could totally ruin the entire thing
My co-workers were really sweet to me a few days ago.
They unexpectedly gave me a birthday cake during our weekly meeting a few days ago. It was really cool!
I'm always ready for anything
Yup! Although I carry a lot of stuff around just in case.
I asked a girl out on a date the other day.  It didnt go the way I expected
she said no.  I was bummed
So my friend got evicted from his apartment recently and he has 2 dogs.
Well i took in his two dogs for the moment. He got evicted due to his roommate not his expenses mind you.
So I just got promoted to manager...
It kind of is_comma_ the other one got fired because of low profit. I can't make the store busier.
Yeah_comma_ got to think of something or I am doomed.
I started bleeding when i poo.
I'm concerned they will tell me something i do not want to hear.
As a teenager my family moved around a lot. I never looked forward to entering a new school.
You just get settled in and then you go again. 
I was on my drive home from work today and this guy started following me.  It was kind of scary
I was worried he was going to follow me home.  eventually he went a different way.  but it was scary
i miss my familly so much
they live 800 miles away and it makes it so hard when i miss them this much.
sometimes. it's hard because i have a ton of nieces and nephews and most of them are too young to have their own phones.
i walked in to the bathroom at work after someone used it 
oh no it stunk and they clogged the toilet. 
oh no i turned right around and walked it. it was awful and i wasn't going to deal with it.
My wife and I were taking a break for a little while_comma_ but we found a spark recently
Yea I was shocked when she came over the other day_comma_ but then things really started clicking.  I think things are really turning around
i went on a date last night
lol. no a friend. it went really well too
it could be
Last year we won our football league when we were actually underdogs_comma_ it was a fantastic moment! 
We all went out for a night out_comma_ you could say alot of alcohol was drank haha
Beer for sure! Yours?
I was at Taco Bell and someone paid for my food! I couldn't believe it!
I was tempted to pay for the person behind me_comma_ but im a little short on money. I shouldn't have been there anyways
So i was taking a friend home from work one day and it started to rain as we got to his place. Like a down pour.
Nope because the umbrella he forgot a while back was in my car.
My new Tesla has a new autopilot and it drove autonomously for 4 miles!
Yes its really impressive with all its technology that I wouldnt have even dreamed about!
My parents took me out to eat at a fancy restaurat last night. 
Yeah I did_comma_ and it was a really kind and generous thing for them to do. 
I was at the fair and I spilled my drink all over me. I was soaked
No_comma_ I had to go home and change
I walked through my old neighborhood this past weekend. All sorts of memories came flooding back.
I know right_comma_ I love the blast of nostalgia which makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside
I am so mad! I just got charged double for something I only got one of! 
The check out person didn't look the brightest and I should have known to check before I left.  The place is like 30 minutes away.  Now it's not worth wasting the gas to get it fixed.
I work in a restaurant and I spit on a customers food yesterday. 
He was being really rude_comma_ but I still feel a little bad about it. 
So I heard a strange noise coming from the kitchen late at night
Yea_comma_ turned out it was just the wind. It was terrifying nonetheless 
I probably shouldn't have_comma_ but I let go the wheel and let autopilot steer my car for 2 miles
I just had so much faith in my new Tesla that I thought I would let it drive itself
I recently purchased a new car_comma_ and within the week got rear-ended in traffic
It was. The dealership didn't believe it when I called them to ask for repair.
I was at the mall and I smelled the sweet smell of cinnamon rolls. It reminded me of home
It's in a country called Bulgaria_comma_ my mom used to make homemade cinnamon rolls
i am on some meds that are making me feel totally off
physically_comma_ mentally_comma_ and emotionally just all over the place.
i'm trying to get better so i'm trying out different options.
I had a surprisingly good meal last night.
No it was at a restaurant. It's not something I usually order but my friend convenienced me to do it. 
Yeah I was pretty suprised!
 I saw a strange figure in the woods whilst camping last weekend.
It was actually and terrifying! unfortunately I only had a potato camera on me so no one believes me I show them the picture
I have been without water all day at my house.
I have been waiting on the plumber all day and he still hasn't shown up!  Im upset!
I'm really good at my job
Yeah my boss can always count on me to do my job well. 
Our teenage son drove his car for the first time today
Its a gently used Honda Accord. He had driving lessons first lol
We finally trusted him with this huge responsibility
I asked my friend to water my plants while I was on vacation but she didn't and they died. I was so mad
No_comma_ but we have always been good friends. The plants were not that expensive_comma_ I really wasn't that mad. She had a minor fender bender and forgot about it
I really did not want to go on the rollercoaster. It looked so fast and scary
It was in canada's wonderland. I was afraid and ended up skipping it!
I took the wife to lunch today for our anniversary.
You would think so_comma_ however_comma_ I caught her flirting with the bartender.
I smelled the perfume my ex used to wear in the mall today
I hope so because I felt so nostalgic about being loved and sharing the joys of life
My sister just told me that she is having a baby!
Yeah I'm so happy for her and her husband!
I certainly will!
I have been training for the football match all week. The hardest I have ever trained
I think I have pushed myself enough_comma_ I feel prepared and think my team is going to win the match
I remember when I was young_comma_ if your parents wanted to know where you were_comma_ they'd go looking for your bicycle lol
lol not that old. :) It's just before we had cell phones. The playground was OUR Playstation 
it was quite fun_comma_ but we had worries too. Like no seat belts in cars !
my boss has been taking advantage of me being a hard worker
what does who do?
she makes me work alone and doesn't do that to anyone else. it drives me nuts.
I meet with my boss today thinking I was getting a raise. I didn't get a raise. 
I don't know. My boss never asks to meet with me so I thought we we're going to talk about me getting a raise. 
We saved up all year to take a nice beach vacation.
So worth it!  It was our first family vacation_comma_ so it was really special.  
Just got my marks best for the test
It was in math_comma_ I got an 95%.
i really want to lose weight but keep just binge eating.
under 200 so i can go horseback riding.
none really. i like to excercise and be outdoors.
I took my wife to one of her favorite restaurants_comma_ and apparently today was their anniversary so they gave us a free (small) desert. It was kind of nice_comma_ really.
It was cheesecake and the wife LOVES cheesecake_comma_ so I'd say her clean plate counts as a yes.
Wow just got chased through a haunted house.
A person pretending to be a ghost.
Oh they were_comma_ but I got the last laugh.
My sister just got laid off from her job. I'm so angry.
Yes_comma_ I thought the company did so very unfairly and it was due to their inability to balance their budget.
I am so glad to have good friends
They are always there when I need them. I got rid of the bad apples long ago
It is. They are llike family
I'm scared of the dark_comma_ but I have to walk home from work in the dark.
Yeah it makes the walk home pretty nerve wraking
I don't make enough money to do that
Proud of my friend! He recently made a hockey team.
It's his first time trying yes_comma_ junior hockey./
Just got ditched by my friend for the third time this week_comma_ when trying to make plans. Wish people weren't so flaky these days. Why does it feel like I'm putting in more effort to hang out with people than vice versa?
Not sure how to approach it. On the one hand we used to be good friends_comma_ and hung out all the time in college. Now after we graduated_comma_ they've grown distant. I don't want to be annoying_comma_ but I want to be available too_comma_ you know? Cause friendships are hard to maintain/create as you get older
My husbands open heart surgery for Monday was postponed. We have to deal with Kidney related issues now
Thank you. We have to treat the symptoms of the Chronic Kidney Disease first_comma_ and then tend to the heart surgery next. We have a long road ahead.
i really enjoy family traditions

I got a speeding ticket today and did not realize I was speeding. The look on the policeman's face though_comma_ was as if I robbed a bank !
I was going 44 in a 30.  I was late for work_comma_ and I guess it just slipped my mind. 
I get my final grades for last semester this week and I am sure I did great.
It's going to be electric engineering.
This guy at work is really annoying me.
Nothing. Thats the problem everyone else is doing the majority of the work.
The problem is_comma_ He is super close to the manager and she loves him because they have "a thing" going on and thats even more frustrating 
I am going back to school after 15 years
I was a psych major before. I am going to see how well that goes first. I might be too old to remember all that stuff
I am because everyone will probably be younger_comma_ but I am determined to get a degree.
Thanks
I had to keep faithful at the party.
A beautiful young blonde girl_comma_ she wanted to kiss.
I am really happy with life right now. Things just seem to always go my way!

Me: I was driving to work and saw a black guy with dreads doing a wheely on a bike that looked like it was for a 12 year old. It was pretty impresive
It was just a regular pedal bike
I was like dang that dude is getting it much respect
I really love disney.
My favorite is 100 dalmatians. The movies from the 2000s were so nostalgic.
My cat keeps knocking over my card sculptures.

It is very hard_comma_ but i know one day it'll turn around
I went on my first roller coaster last month! I was scared out of my mind and was sweating bullets!

I visited my old high school yesterday
I was suprised. It really brought back a lot of fond memories. 
My coworkers are really annoying. 
Yeah they talk like they know it all but they are terrible at their jobs. 
Feeling quite confident going in to this exam.
It's a calculus exam_comma_ I need to score over a 60%.
I cant wait to take some time off of work. I have an awesome beach trip coming up next week.
That would be the worst. I cant wait to just lay around all day drinking cold beers on the beach.
I went to my high school reunion the other day and got myself into some trouble
Yea_comma_ and I cheated on my wife with my high school girlfriend.  I dont know if I should tell her.  I feel bad about it

I got a divorce a few years back. It was pretty rough
Doing much better. It took about a year to finally get it official but life goes on you know?
This ref had the gall to call off my goal.
It was_comma_ he couldn't see the angle it went in at.
I'm a patient guy...but if there's one thing I can't stand it's a stupid person who is stubborn about their own stupidity
Like a friend turning down my advice_comma_ even though I've been down that road too many times to count...go ahead_comma_ keep throwing yourself in the fire I'm not the one getting burned buddy boy
I miss when I was younger. 
Yeah_comma_ back then I was able to stay up all night an be just fine!
I was on vacation last week and for the most part the trip was good.  except for one small part
I saw a ghost at the hotel.  After that I couldnt fall asleep.  They told me the next day it was haunted.  I was so scared
Before I got my dog_comma_ my life felt empty. He's my best friend now !
My life is now complete. He's so trustworthy and listens to everything I say to him lol. 
Other people always have more food than me.
I just can not even think about them right now!
I feel good about my applications.

I spent the whole day trying to help my friend find his dog
nope.  i was really upset that we couldnt find him
Greetings!  A while back we had a groundhog make a little den underneath our deck to have it's babies.  We were going to call animal control but decided to wait because I thought it'd be more human.  After a couple weeks they left on their own.
Excuse me I meant humane*!  Sorry about that.  But yes_comma_ I felt bad for it.  I read that sometimes relocation can be very hard for the animal and it may die because it's so disoriented.
I do indeed.  Currently two cats.  They are very therapeutic.
When I hear 80s instrumentals and it reminds me of my family's Christmas karaoke nights_comma_ good times :))

Yea I think He will continue to improve. It feels great knowing he can achieve if he tries.
I was at the store the other day and some old man offered to pay for my drink! He said he didn't want anything in return_comma_ he was feeling generous!
It was! I just wish I could do something to repay him. I hope I see him again.
i was scared walking home the other day
there were werewolves following me
My coworker got a raise over me. 
I don't think we need to go that far. I'm just jealous because I do much better job than her. 
Expecting the worst and hoping for the best has always worked out in my favor.  
How so
The garbage collector did not take my trash today.
I should!  I am so upset about it!
Just got home from class and she's gone.
My cat sally. she is my true love I'm hurt right now.
i hope to be able to get my finances in order by the end of the year
i'm working on it 
thank you so much i'm really trying.

I downloaded some old Nintendo games last weekend. I havent played some of those games since I was a little kid.

I am shocked that it isn't rained today.
We really need the rain_comma_ my grass is turning brown.

Yes it is and I don't like it at all.
I got pulled over by the police earlier.
No_comma_ I am so thankful he didn't give me one.
She just drove off after hitting my cat.
No she passed away I'm so sad right now.
Detachment from the outcome is key to my personal success. Because even though I don't get my way one time_comma_ I know the odds will be better the next couple of times around it's how lady luck works
Thanks.  I've just learned the hard way so many times that I've had to flip my paradigm on it's head and eat humble pie
I spent some time with my middle daughter by taking her to ice cream. She is so sweet and lovely. We had a very special time. 
It is hard_comma_ but my kids are happy and they know I love them. I think that is the most important thing. 
I'm worried about the end of the world
Because it's coming! I'm ready for it though because I have bunch of supplies to survive. 
Not just an emergancy. THE END OF THE WORLD
Last night I saw Shin Lim's new performance on AGT!  Right before his performance he put out a video on YouTube and let everyone know it was about to happen.  It was great.
Yea it was really good.  I was also really happy to know that he may start doing regular illusions and not just card magic.
I will indeed.  I think he is the next David Copperfield.
I was walking out of the store the other day and walked right into the glass pane! It was so clean_comma_ I didn't realize the door wasn't open! Talk about humiliating!
Yeah_comma_ there was no "cool" way to play it off either.  I swallowed my pride and left as quickly as possible.
Stupid stubborn people are....the worst. Like_comma_ Stupid people still have hope_comma_ you can convince them if they are humble enough...but a stupid person with an ego is like trying to wash dishes with cat piss and horse sh*t
Yes there has to be a balance
i really miss my family

that is true_comma_ it is not to be taken for granted
We had a car alarm go off at work and I started getting upset that no one was turning it off.  Then I discovered it was from my car.  
Just a false alarm like most other times.  I felt pretty stupid getting mad at the others
Some dude..because I live in a ghetto city..thought it was okay to pull up on my property beeping until I came out..smoking his cig with ashes in my driveway
 Makes me so angry at how UNCOUTH people are here. NOPE I live in michigan
I am trying. Takes awhile to save up a down payment. So over the ghetto people here. Never experienced anything like it
I dropped my son off at daycare for the first time this week.
Monday.  It was the first time I've been away from him for more than a couple hours
It went better than expected!  The lead up was honestly worse.
My landlord didn't want to repair the ceiling. He take the rent but he doesn't want to make any reparations.
I can sue him but it can be a very long process. I am looking to move to another appartment. This is making very mad.
I make a lot of money at my job. 
Thanks! It feels really good to provide for my family and give them everything they need. 
I have to make a cheesecake later.
I am so ready to do it!

That's my line of thinking as well! I'd never cheat on my wife. I couldn't hurt someone I love like that. And if he didn't love her_comma_ why not tell her first?
Absolutely! If you can't stay dedicated to someone_comma_ just break it off before things get out of hand and you hurt them more.
I finally got some food today. So happy.
I'm totally! I haven't ate all day and was getting lightheaded.

I don't know. I am trying to cope with these challenges. I am not sure how far i can go on like this
My pet toad died_comma_ I am so sad.
I have had him for five years.

I intend to. I am going to binge watch one of my favorite shows and snack eat all day.
My little child is dancing now.
Yeah_comma_ I'm doing. I just amazed with her dance.
I really like the new Nike shoes.

I came home from work today and found my dog dead
Definitely!  He was my best friend for 11 years!
No I don't think so.  Not right now :(
I am so mad that my window broke.
A bird flew into it.
I am really excited to get this package that I had ordered a few days ago.
I had ordered this gift for my nephew_comma_ and it should be here tomorrow. It is those magnet tiles that are popular now.
Anywhere from as low as $15 to about $30 for a good set.
I really wish I get into law school.
Yes but I know I can do it.
I am so upset my girlfriend dumped me.
She said she needed a break.

My dog will have a surgery soon
Someone ran over him
Even if it does_comma_ the vet said he wont walk again
I finally saved enough money for a used car. It was a lot of effort but I'm glad I finally can drive again.
It took quite a while! About four months of extra cash.
A Honda accord. I really like Hondas for used cars. They seem to be built to last.
My grandma was just transferred to hospice care.
Her and I have always been so close. I am devastated. 
I really do not like pigs_comma_ they scare me.
No_comma_ I do not even want to be within a mile of one.
I can't wait for the summer to be gone.
I can't stand the heat.
Man.  You know what really grinds my gears??
This STUPID printer we have at work!!!!  I hate it hate it HATE it!!! 
I might!!! I might also take it out in the field with a baseball bat!!
My weekend plan is cancelled due to the weather. It sucks
Yeah i got to do that. but  it was so frustrating it got cancellaed
I'm feeling a little down since my wife will be gone for the weekend.
I don't really have anything to do! I will be all alone here_comma_ so I probably will sleep in.
Me and my friends are going on a road trip. I think it will go well
Gold coast. I don't anticipate any issues though
I am so ready for the football season.
I am a Falcons fan.
I really wish my fish was still alive.
He died two weeks ago.
We almost lose our house last month
My wife didn't paid the bills with the money I gave her to
She bought a purse
I really appreciate all my friends I have.
Yes_comma_ I prefer them on the happy days thou
Sometimes my partner can sleep for over 24 hours_comma_ it is so crazy.
No_comma_ he just does that like once or twice a month.  I can sleep up to 16 hours straight if I tried.
It is for sure but I guess normal for us.
My exams are next week and i have prepared very well. i think it will go smooth
Yeah i know. It just the intuition i will do well. Exam's are scary though
I was watching an old movie and when it came to the sad part it made me cry.
Yes I am. My family always makes fun of me. I can cry at the drop of a hat.
I am trying to decide if I want to move in with my fiancee before the wedding.
We have talked and I probably will so we can save money_comma_ but I am not sureof it is the right choice.
I went to my friend's house recently and it was horrific. 
It was just so dirty inside. Like he never cleaned it at all.
So I just got a check from a family member who just passed. For 100_comma_000 dollars
Payoff my credit cards_comma_ invest some of it. I don't know how taxes work on this stuff so I don't want to spend too much
Better safe then sorry aye?
I was so upset after I discovered that half of my take out order was completely missing from the bag!
Yep_comma_ and it was so frustrating because I had to drive back twenty minutes to the place.
No_comma_ they just were apologetic about it. Very frustrating.
The phone company almost charged my wife 500 dollars for a broken phone she had to return.
They fortunately worked it out and there was no charge_comma_ but the worst part was that she tasked me with returning it on time and I totally didn't. I really screwed up.
Yes indeed_comma_ that would've been quite the financial ding!
When I was about 12 years old_comma_ I went into a guitar shop and stole some strings. I always felt bad about it. They were cheap_comma_ but still_comma_ I hate that I did it.
Haha that makes me feel better_comma_ thanks!
I had to cancel plans for this weekend. I got really sick last night. I feel bad.
I feel okay now_comma_ with a lot of sleep. But I dont want to risk going on a roadtrip.
I don't drink anymore and I'm careful about new medications.
I wish it was for health reasons.
The doctor warned me but I ended up making a fool of myself. 
A couple of years ago_comma_ when I was in college_comma_ I needed to move several heavy things from my apartment but I didn't have a car.
I did_comma_ actually. I didn't know him very well_comma_ but he was in my class and very generously offered to help.  I wasn't sure he would come through_comma_ but fortunately he did!
Yep_comma_ we got everything into storage without a problem.  I was super appreciative_comma_ since I definitely couldn't afford to hire anybody on a college student's budget.
You ever browse through old photos on a friend's Facebook page? Kinda weird right?
It is when it's an attractive friend...and it's obvious you're creeping on them. Man that's embarrassing.
We do dumb stuff when we're young. I don't think I'mma live that one down tho
After failing inspection_comma_ my friend offered to repair the required parts of my car with his own tools_comma_ I was confident he could do so for significantly cheaper than the garage.
Only for the required parts. He did the labor for free! I tipped him though_comma_ of course. 
He took the car to his own mechanic and it passed the inspection no problem. Probably saved about $500. 
Last night I finished reading one of my favorite books from when I was a teenager.
Clive Barker's Abarat. It is incredbily good but a little dark.
I lent my co-worker $200 today so she could pay her rent. 
I was happy to be in the position to be able to lend her the money. I'm really hoping she pays me back_comma_ though! Money's always a bit tight for me too!
I am so lucky to have such good kids. I can let them do what they want and not have to worry much.
It is really nice to think I have done a good job teaching them. I hope they keep it up and keep making good choices. Being a parent is a scary thing.
I'm just getting older and older. I feel so far away from my childhood when things felt so very open ended.
I try to_comma_ but it just gets so hard sometimes. I appreciate you giving me the space to talk this out thank you. I just wish times were just as simple as they seemed when I was younger.
SOMETIMES IT IS SAD TO SEE SOME POOR PEOPLE .. DO YOU AGREE
YES.. WORSE YET.. SOME ARE STRUGGLING TO MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS.. 
I've been taking martial arts classes. 
no I'm really bad at it. I get so nervous and uncomfortable there_comma_ but I want to learn it.
Exactly the other day I had to do a demo in front of the class and I was partnered with someone who doesn't like me. 
I got this email about winning and iPhone and fell for it_comma_ I sent them the information they asked for
Well first off I started getting super weird emails and then I got an alert from my bank saying my account had been hacked!
They got all of my checking account_comma_ but my bank is looking into it as a fraud investigation_comma_ so I really hope they can recover it for me_comma_ I should not believe everything people say so much
My first dog died a year ago. He was only 4 years old.
He had to have surgery because he ate something he shouldn't and it got caught. They told us he only had a 5% chance of survival and even then he would be in a lot of pain for a long time. We put him down to keep him out of pain.
When my son was born_comma_ the doctors thought he was having seizures. He had to stay in the NICU and his life was in the doctors hands. Thankfully_comma_ he has been fine ever since and perfectly healthy.
Actually_comma_ they think he was just a really big baby and had low sugar.. 
Thank you! He's been doing great!
I'm feeling a bit nervous today. I'm selling an appliance on Craigslist and I have someone coming over to look at it.
Nervous about the person! It's always a risk having a stranger come to your home!
So_comma_ I was in Barcelona a month or so ago and had an early flight to Rome. I was catching a bus at 4am and this car comes out of nowhere and offered me and the other 3 people there a ride to the airport for 12 euro. It didn't even look like a cab. Sketchy.
We did. This British chick convinced me it was worth the risk. The Chinese tourist couple just went along with it. I refused to put my backpack in the trunk and rode up front with it in case I needed to tuck and roll hah. Had my phone out with the GPS to make sure he was actually going to the airport. It all ended up being fine...aside from the speeding.
Last Monday I lost my keys at  the mall and couldn't find them.
It was_comma_ but I prayed and made and promise to go to church if I found them_comma_ and I immediately did
We just had a giant storm roll through this week. So much rain and lightning. The ground got so saturated that a tree fell down in my yard.
Unfortunately it did. It fell right on my shed and absolutely flattened. I have insurance but the shed had a lot of tools in it that held kind of a family heirloom value to me.
Thank you for your concern. It hurts to see that stuff go but at least I'm not at a total loss.
I left my ID in a friend's car a few days ago.
Yea I told him about my mistake and he said he will try to return it as soon as possible.
I took in a kitten 2 months ago. I have been bottle feeding and raising her by hand.
Well she was abandoned by her mother. Usually kittens are not so much work
I'm feeling so regretful today. I went shopping and spent way more than I should have. I think I might have to return some of the things I bought.
I feel so badly that I bought a bunch of junk! I don't know what comes over me while I'm shopping! Ha!
I am thinking about giving my savings to a friend who is opening a business to manage investments.
It was a friend from high school and I believe he is a reliable person.
My recent relationship_comma_ I wasn't concerned about my partner cheating.
Yea it was
They wanted to move and I didn't.
I need to learn to be more calm and understand that there around people around me who love me and are supporting me.
I'm just really nervous about a lot of stuff_comma_ because I'm originally from Florida_comma_ but I'm not in Florida right now and I would really like it if I could go back. But I don't know how to make it work out.
I just had to move_comma_ but my landlord couldn't let me bring my pets in. I left them in the care of a friend. Theyre very trusting but I am still worried.
Yes I love them so much and I'm going to miss them. It takes a lot for me to put trust in someone like that_comma_ I hope it works out!
Thank you for giving me the space to talk!
I forgot to get my girlfriend a birthday present.
Definitely mad_comma_ but I'm trying to make it up with a romantic dinner and stuff. I don't know how I overlooked this.
When I lay in bed with my kitties at night. All of my problems fall away.
That's really sad. I'm allergic to them if they aren't brushed or if they don't clean themselves. It's an awful feeling.
I almost killed my poor little betta fish one time.
 I was really sick and couldn't clean the bowl. he got fin rot. he is good now though.
yes_comma_ thank you. that was rough
I had to put my cat to sleep last week. It was so hard.
I'm so heartbroken! He was old_comma_ sick and in pain_comma_ so it was time. It doesn't make it easier though! 
I don't know where my life is heading right now_comma_ but I believe that God knows the desires of my heart and he will get me there.
I've gone through a lot of hard times in life_comma_ sometimes I feel as though I've had more hard times than a lot of people_comma_ and I just feel like I'm going to be blessed.
Someone brought me flowers this morning. It was very nice but I don't have a vase or anything.
Oh! That's smart. I'm not crafty_comma_ clearly lol
I finally have some stability in my life for the first time in a long time. It feels very good to be able not to worry about much... For now.
Yes indeed. I just found a new place to live_comma_ got a car for a good deal_comma_ and have been doing well at my new job. I am sorry for bragging_comma_ I just feel really good about things.
Thank you for the well wishing I do appreciate it.
My boyfriend want to buy a house but I think the housing bubble is going to burst again.
yeah_comma_ I just don't want to be one of the unlucky one's 
You are right. Thanks!
I have a friend who helped me a great deal when my husband and I separated and I could not deal with him.
Thanks_comma_ she helped a lot in that situation.
I am going to see a concert at the end of the month.
They are a coverband of a band from the 80s. 
My son really wanted a bow and arrow_comma_ but I could not afford to get him one
Well he is only four_comma_ so he does not know a lot about money yet_comma_ I feel so bad for him
That is very true_comma_ hopefully we can raise him to understand money is not everything
I recently started seeing a lady and I want to be committed to her to help build our relationship.
I have made fumbles in the past_comma_ but I'm working on self improvement. Also I'm trying to keep an open mind.
I've been feeling a bit nervous about my next decisions in life. How do I know what the right thing to do is?
I think the right thing to do is_comma_ if people around you know what you should be doing or where you should be going_comma_ they should tell you plainly. To not do that is providing them plausible deniability if you screw up.
Sometimes I feel that I have more people around me that want to drive me like a horse rather than love me as a son. But_comma_ I guess that's not true. It's just my feelings.
In many circumstances_comma_ I feel as though I'm confused by situations in my life. I hope that everything turns out for the best.
Oh man I can't wait to give my mother in law her house back. I just got a new place but have to wait a week to move in.
A little slower than I want but at least it's going to happen. I'm getting very antsy though haha.
Yes! Thanks for listening! It's making me more excited! haha
I miss my old dog_comma_ I was thinking about getting another one but I'm not sure.
It's been 2 years_comma_ so I'm out of the habit of walking_comma_ cleaning_comma_ etc.
I recently quit a really bad job_comma_ but I didn't have another job lined up
It definitely is. It took a huge leap of faith
In the past_comma_ I was given a loving home with parents that helped me and a career path I could have succeeded on_comma_ and I blew it.
Maybe you're right. I just need help in so many different areas of my life...
My storage unit got robbed while I was moving to a new home. They took all my family antiques and precious items.
I know_comma_ thought about selling those things. wish I had done that. at least got money for them.
That's true. still have a few things for memories.
I know it's very petty of me but it is starting to bug me. My family has been very generous towards my adult sister as of late but have not really paid much attention to me.
This has happened on and off for years_comma_ and I always try to talk to them. I usually get no response. It's led me to be self-sufficient fortunately.
I have in the past and it didn't seem to work. I'm hopeful they will open up to me one day though.
I remember a time where I was asked to help out with a kids camp as a volunteer and it was about 2 months ahead of time_comma_ so I completely forgot about it and ended up not going
no idea_comma_ I was too embarrassed to respond
no worries_comma_ I was having a bug either for some reason
My wife's out of town right now on business. She has to go on these trips a few times a year. I miss her a lot.
Yeah I do. I usually go out and catch up with friends a lot. Plus I know she's working hard to help provide for us_comma_ so I greatly appreciate it.
She should! Thanks for hearing me out_comma_ it helps a lot!
I was able to find some Blue Bell ice cream on sale the other day.
Yea I love the brand it has almost a home churned style taste in my opinion.
Oh boy I am livid! I just got this new couch from my family and my cats have already shredded an entire side of it.
No_comma_ that's what's very shocking about this! They're decent cats. I know they're animals who don't know better but I really liked this couch.
Agreed. We forget that they're small animals. Their brains aren't that big!
I let my boyfriend make all or most of our decisions.
He would much rather it be that way. he is more calculated and experienced in life than I am.
Yep_comma_ I get to learn from him too.
I got really down this morning. I saw a treehouse on the side of the road and it made me remember mine.
I outgrew it. It was a long long time ago back in my childhood.
Yeah that's all we have sometimes_comma_ I guess.
It's been a rough day! My water heater is busted. Fortunately I got a plumber coming in that can fix it over the weekend.
Yeah_comma_ it's rare in my area to get work done over the weekend. I'm thinking it could be done by monday_comma_ fingers crossed!
I don't know what will happen in the future if Global Warming is not stopped.
And the fires too_comma_ there have been a lot of those lately_comma_ seems that worse than ever.
I really screwed up today! I was working on a big pot of pit beef_comma_ followed the old family recipe_comma_ and it tastes like garbage!
Could've been a seasoning issue_comma_ I'm not too sure. I was so determined to make a good batch of this stuff! Oh well_comma_ I can always try again.
For sure! I think I'll nail it next time!
Kids grow up so fast_comma_ It seem like yesterday when mine were babies.
The oldest is 14 and is beginning high school next week.
Oooo I was not feeling that good earlier in the week. I made some egg salad and I guess I didn't cook it right because I got very ill.
I'm almost there. It's a lot better today than earlier in the week. I think "ill" would be an understatement.
It might been a good old American case of generic food poisoning.
I remember when my grandma was sick and we the grandchildren took turns keeping her company and helping her with whatever she needed.
I believe so and it was a very sweet experience for us.
Hi_comma_ I went on a road trip this summer.
It was great! It was a long drive_comma_ but my husband didn't get lost.
It was a very busy week for me_comma_ but now that the weekend is here I'm looking forward to relaxing at home.
With work the kids and everything else_comma_ but I feel relieved that the weekday is over and plan to watch some good movies over the weekend and do nothing much.
Yesterday I went to the supermarket with some old clothes I wear around the house not expecting to meet anyone I know_comma_ but I met my boss and his wife.
Yes_comma_ but it was to be expected after all_comma_ it is what happen when you dress like you expect to meet no one_comma_ I guess.
Last week I ate my husband's leftovers_comma_ even though I knew he was looking forward to it.
I kind of pretended I forgot it was was his_comma_ and he believed me.  Or acted like it lol.
I had a job interview yesterday and it went great_comma_ so I'm expecting for them to call soon.
Thank you!  I look forward to working for that company because it seems really nice and they pay good salaries.
In two weeks I'll be back teaching with a brand new group of kids.
I am_comma_ but slightly nervous too.
I just dyed my hair for the first time by myself. I had to watch a lot of videos to make sure I knew how to do it.
It was_comma_ I did the back last. A youtuber gave a good tip to treat it like shampooing your hair. That really helped
My cat tore apart my favorite book this morning
It a copy of the shining.
I recently rewatched on of my favorite childhood movies.
Mystery Men
I went skydiving a few weeks ago. It was certainly an exercise in trust.
It was! And my tandem partner was great. I'm still alive_comma_ which is a testament. :)
I got a lot of hours at work for next month. I hope I can use it to move to a new apartment
I work for a company that releases standardized tests in the US
The first time I went on a motorcycle_comma_ I was scared. But I knew my husband wouldn't do anything to hurt me. I trusted him with my life.
Yes_comma_ It was so much fun. I didn't want it to end.
I start a new job in a few weeks and I'm nervous_comma_ I hope I'll like it. 
Thanks! Change is always hard. But I am looking forward to new challenges. 
What do you do for work?
When I was a kid_comma_ I watched Psycho at a sleepover on Halloween.
I actually avoided the shower for days!  lol
I'll watch them now because my husband loves them_comma_ but they're not my favorite
I had to borrow money from my parents to pay the mortgage. I am having trouble making ends meet.
Thanks I hope so too. I recently took on a second part time job so that should help. These are tough times for a lot of people. 
I just keep buying lottery tickets! A girl can dream!
A friend of mine recently met George Clooney at a restaurant and posted a picture with him on Instagram!
Yes she even spoke to him for while!  I wish it was me_comma_ I love the guy!
We are really wanting wanting to buy a newer and bigger vehicle_comma_ but we're not sure if we can afford it.
Problem is we don't have a car payment now and going back to having one would be a struggle. We are trying to figure out and pay off bills now.
I ate a whole gallon of ice cream by myself in one sitting and now I'm not feeling too happy.
Yeah_comma_ I'm telling myself that its okay since it was just a one time thing. I'll walk it off tomorrow! 
I can't believe I was so stupid to believe this...
My boyfriend.  I knew he cheated on me but he said he wouldn't do it again. 
True. Makes me feel so dumb though!
Agreed!
My uncle volunteered to fix my car. I was going to take it to the dealership.
I thought so. Though I wondered_comma_ should I risk not going to the dealership.
I'm glad I let him fix it though. Car works great.
Yeah. I saved $300.
I love looking at old photos. Makes me miss the good old days.
Yeah_comma_ even ones from 5 or 6 years ago! Especially ones of the kids. 
It's true! You can really see the passage of time. I try to take lots of photos but it's easy to forget when you're in the moment. 
I'm in a wedding party tomorrow_comma_ and I've been called upon to give a big toast during the reception.
I am deeply touched and I've got everything laid out_comma_ but it's in front of a large amount of people and I'm sweating bullets over it.
I keep pacing back and forth going over everything. I hope it works out!
I was thinking about a friend of mine who passed away a few years ago.  Then I found some letters that he had written me.
It did_comma_ but it made me smile while reading them.
I can't believe I thought I'd get away with this...
I'm doing awful in math class. We had an assignment and I found some of the answers in the back of the book. 
I did! It was awful. I got called out in front of everyone_comma_ too.
You got that right.
So_comma_ I went to a bachelorette weekend with my girl friends. All of them were doing things their husbands would NOT be happy with_comma_ but I stayed far away from anything like that.
They were kissing and dancing on other men. My husband would have been so upset if I was doing it_comma_ too!
I know! Some have them have told me how guilty they felt. I am just happy I didn't take part in any of it.
Doubt it!
I was at work assigned to a project on a team.
Well. I ended up taking someone's work and passing it off as my own.
My spouse had a brief affair last year. It ended and we are still together.
A co-worker. 
Both of them!
Oh I was so shaking in my boots. I was sitting outside on my patio and saw a shadowy figure inside my house!
At first_comma_ I jumped and ran in because I certainly wasn't expecting visitors. But it was my wife! She was home from work early!
Yeah we had a good laugh over it_comma_ but I swear to you I was very scared!
My son got in big trouble at school.  He was very mean to his best friend_comma_ and I had to call his mom and explain what had happened.
He wasn't even upset with his friend_comma_ he was upset with someone else.  I felt so bad having to explain it to his friends mom.
She was fine with it.  She knew he was in big trouble at home.
New neighbors moved in this week_comma_ and they have a dog that looks almost exactly like my childhood dog.
When I first saw it I felt like I had time traveled for a second.  So weird.
Oh I wish I could clear my closet out but I just can't part with these things.
I don't use it but I've collected so many little things in memory boxes. It's really grown to a few boxes now. 
They really are. Maybe I should put them into a scrapbook!
My father sent me a photo of a letter I wrote for his birthday when I was a kid.
I wrote about how much I appreciated him picking me up from school everyday and helping me with my homework. So adorable to read it!
Yeah_comma_ I'm glad he kept them because it's always amazing to find it later in life.
Me too. I will keep every little drawing and letter they make me. It's worth it.
I signed up to do a lot of food for a family reunion next weekend. I have to start getting supplies now for sure!
My family's reunions are incredibly memorable. I volunteered for a lot of desserts so I think it's fair to get started this weekend. I want to be ready.
I'm glad you asked! I make a mean german chocolate cake everyone raves about. It makes me feel good to help out.
I love cheesecake_comma_ I should do that as well.
I am a nurse and I take care of people in the last stage of their lives.
Yes it is. It's really tough. I never stop caring about the loss. It's hard. 
That's the best part. Some people are in so much pain it's a relief for them to go. Hard on the families though. 
It's rewarding but also pretty high burn out. I take two really good vacations a year!
I went to make a patty melt today and my bread was moldy.
I know! It was a super specific craving I was having too.
I just had a salad.
So_comma_ my mom invited me and my kids on a road trip. 
Kind of. I was worried because my husband wouldn't be coming along and my kids are very young_comma_ 3 years and 6 months.
I definitely had my doubts_comma_ especially with the trip being so long. 16 hours in the car!
I was totally comfortable last night watching a movie with my boyfriend and eating popcorn.
We both agreed on Fight Club.
Yep_comma_ thanks
Man I had a really cute girl hit on me
I told her I had a girlfriend but was flattered 
This has been such a great summer so far. I just got a new job in June and I bought a new set of wheels this week!
I put money down on a Toyota Tacoma. It wasn't my first choice but it gets the job done for sure.
That's why I went for it_comma_ that engine will last me a very long time. They're very dependable.
I was talking to my boss and used a word that I didn't know the real meaning of. made a total fool of myself. lol
Totally. at least I know what the word means now so I can use it in the future.
We've moved a lot of the past decade for my husband's job.
yeah_comma_ change is so hard for me!  but it's been worth it
I just put some snow tires up for sale on the internet. I stopped using Craigslist awhile ago because of some bad experiences so I hope it goes okay.
That was my mistake in the past. I always went to weird locations to exchange things. I have to be smart about it nowadays.
That is true! Thanks for your advice. I want to be more open to selling stuff on the web to strangers for sure.
I've been married to the same person for over 34 years
Yeah_comma_ be fully committed_comma_ communicate about everything & let petty things roll right off.
Thanks! You can do it! With the right person_comma_ it's not as hard as it seems. So I guess the real secret is to find the right person from the start. ;)
My heart sank when I heard about my favorite teacher from elementary school passing away.
I hope so. I heard it was cancer. He was always such a happy man. It's a shame.
Thanks for the kind words. He was a lot older than me so I hope he lived a great life. 
I need to past a test next week but since I am well prepared I believe I will have no trouble doing it.
I am feeling pretty good about it since I think I am very well prepared.
My husband and I decided we wanted a night to ourselves_comma_ but we've never let our son stay the night anywhere. I was pretty nervous. 
He's 3 now_comma_ but at the time he was about one and a half. We decided to let him stay with his grandparents that night.
I've spent at least an hour a day on overwatch for the past 3 months. Altogether I have roughly 90 hours this season
I would say it's my favorite fps now by a mile. Cod became fecal matter 5 or 6 years ago. I'm hoping I can finally stop being a pleb and hit diamond next season
Overwatch is a team oriented game_comma_ just try your est to communicate and use strategies_comma_ while also self improving and you will climb.
I recently renovated my home and it's so nice to be done with all the work!
We painted_comma_ bought new furniture and installed new tile and light fixtures. It's so relaxing to be able to sit back and enjoy the new space we worked so hard to create!
We are going camping next weekend and I have all the equipment to do it right_comma_
Yes I have all of that plus everything else we will be needing.
I just moved back near family_comma_ and I'm feeling overwhelmed with how close knit everything is again.
I'm very lucky to be back and around them though. They are truly generous people.
I can't wait. They can really help me get through some tough times. They're always there.
I have to go get my tooth pulled soon. I hate the dentist
It's an impacted wisdom tooth_comma_ it is stuck under my gum line
I have a distant relative that's been abusing their dog_comma_ and I have to rescue it from their property.
I'm bringing some backup with me to start off. I'm going to just be direct and take the dog. If that doesn't work I'll have to get animal control involved.
It is a staffordshire terrier. It's a lovely dog and very sweet. The dog certainly doesn't deserve this treatment_comma_ no dogs do.
My brother told me that he won a 75" TV from work. He says it looks good with his new Xbox!
No_comma_ I have no where to put it but I'm going to his house to watch football for sure.
He better!
I am old enough to remember the times before internet and social media when people you spoke over the phone or in person.
That's it!  I guess I miss having what I believe where much more  meaningful contacts with people on a daily basis.
My wife's grandmother passed on a couple weeks ago. It's still eating at me to think about it.
I had become close to her as of late. She was a very strong and respected woman.
I think she did. We got along very well and she was always happy to see me.
My daily life consists of getting up_comma_ going to work or going to college. I miss being young and spending my day playing videogames and playing outside
If im not studying or working I usually go out for a run_comma_ practice piano or do surveys online to make some extra cash
Its hard at first_comma_ but with practice comes perfection.
Even when it has been a rough year_comma_ I am now feeling that things are beginning to go my way and I can expect good thing for the future.
Sure_comma_ there are a few things...
That one I can't tell...
I haven't slept well this week at all. The county has been drilling outside my house for 12 hours a day.
They're ripping up the road to just re-do. I'm not saying it's unnecessary but it's sure driving me nutty!
I'm not sure! Nobody has been able to give me a clear answer_comma_ not even the workers outside.
I really though I was going to be accepted in med school_comma_ but I wasn't.
I don't know and now I don't know what I am going to do with my life either.
I'm waiting to hear back from the nursing program I applied to for my degree
I think I will get in since my board exam score is good_comma_ and my GPA is high. I don't want to be too confident though! I heard the program is competitive.
They really are. Thanks!
I'm much better off now but I just got out of a time of my life where I was isolated out in a rural area away from a lot of people.
At first I felt that way_comma_ but over a period of time it can get very overwhelming.
I did try to keep busy to keep it from setting in but it got to be too much sometimes. I'm glad that I am away from that.
My boss is coming for dinner tonight with his wife. 
Yes I am. Many things could go wrong I hope they don't or I probably won't be getting a raise and worse still I will be to embarrassed to ask for it.
We just got a new puppy_comma_ a real water dog. We have been trying to get it to swim and today he did for the first time!
At first_comma_ he was curious about the water but had a scared look in his eyes. But he did it!
I love this dog_comma_ I think I'm going to keep him haha!
Last night I was running in the road in a very lonely place and a car began to follow me slowly.
Yes_comma_ thank god I just took a picture of the car and pretend to be sending it and the car just went away quickly.
My daughter snuk out the window last night.
Cops brought her home this morning. She was still drunk from the party she went to.
I agree_comma_ needless to say_comma_ she is grounded til Thanksgiving.
I want to lose wait and I'm trying to eat less_comma_ but just a few minutes ago a had some sugar cravings and ate a whole package of cookies.
Yes_comma_ and now I feel awful about eating those cookies.
Last year I was about to run my first 50 mile race.  I had broken my toes a few weeks before and wasn't sure I was going to make it.
It did_comma_ thankfully I had listened to my doctor's recommendations and it healed up just enough.  It was still a pretty nerve wracking start though.
When I was a kid I threw a rock at a boy. It hit him on the forehead and made a big gash. I felt so bad about doing it.
It's hard to believe but I didn't. I honestly didn't think it would hit him. He had been fighting with my little brother and I was just trying to scare him off.
I was looking through my old family album and realized I had a really good childhood.
Me too. Makes me really miss my family.
A reunion is possible but we all live so far away.
I was at the store and some old guy bought my groceries for me. It helped restore my faith in humanity
No_comma_ he just said he felt like doing something good!
I hope  it does!
I studied endlessly for my biology final_comma_ and while I was taking the test_comma_ I felt good about my responses
Yes! I got an A. It was definitely satisfying to see that my hard work paid off.
My family is finally settled down in one place after moving around a lot.
Very happy!  It's so nice to be able to put down roots_comma_ to finally feel at home.
I love walking my dogs on these late summer mornings. It's still cool_comma_ the sun is shining_comma_ and I still have two more weeks off.
A boston terrier and a chihuhua cross. 
Most of the time_comma_ until we see another dog. 
Yeah_comma_ I use that too! What breed do you have?
The new school semester starts in a few days and I have all of my supplies ready!
I'm very excited. This year is crucial for my degree's program and I want to make sure I raise my GPA.
I saw a dog on the side of the road that had been hit by a car_comma_ it was so sad
No
I believe that most people are good people_comma_ deep down.
I am a high school teacher and it's hard to keep that in mind sometimes
On the best of days_comma_ yes! I love it though. 
yes_comma_ definitely. I keep in touch with a lot of the kids as they become adults. 
A bad storm with a tornado almost went through my town_comma_ I was so scared
No_comma_ I live in an apartment
I am saving up my money to buy a home next year sometime. I think it can happen.
I am so excited. I'm thinking of all the things I want to do to it and I don't even know what it looks like yet.
Thanks_comma_ I will!
I return to work in September to a new role. I'm excited but anxious. 
I got the new role in June_comma_ so not too long. It's within my organization. 
Thanks! I'm sure I'll love it. What do you do?
Oh cool. That must be quite liberating. 
I woke up this morning to find that my dog pooped on my brand new rug!
It was too late. He did know I was mad at him. I could tell he knew he did wrong.
Aww I like those. He is a little shitzu. 
yep_comma_ spoiled little brat he is.
I was at the fair_comma_ and I spilled my drink all over myself
Yeah
I am a very committed spouse. I have been married 15 years.
DO you think you'll ever want to get married? Marriage can be hard. 
Yeah_comma_ I guess it depends on meeting the one. 
I felt so badly today because my son overheard me yelling and cursing out his dad because he was late picking up our son.  I didn't mean for him to overhear that but I was really angry. 
I haven't had a chance yet since he's still with his dad.  I hope to call him later tonight. 
We're waiting to see what size my husband's bonus will be.  This is the first year he's eligible for anything bigger than a Starbucks gift card lol
haha true_comma_ prices are insane there!  We're hoping to be able to afford a new roof this year
When I was younger_comma_ my best friend and I worked together.  She ended up getting the promotion that we both wanted.
I'd been working there longer so it really stung.  Our friendship survived though!
My neighbours just bought a new car and put in a pool. I feel like I just can't get ahead- I can barely pay the bills.
For them it is_comma_ I guess. 
Well_comma_ I guess I'm envious. They are better off than me I guess. 
I had to walk bare footed to a point
I was looking for a shoe mender
Someone at my work missed part of their shift due to a personal issue_comma_ but requested I withhold any information that would reveal they missed such time
I did my best to speak around the subject to anyone that may have otherwise brought it up_comma_ Luckily no one ended up being at all the wiser
They are too good to me
My frisds
I had the chance to look through my girlfriend's phone while I was in the shower_comma_ I decided not to because I felt I could respect her privacy
i hope so i hope i did the right thing
We have to make an expensive repair to our car.
We do technically_comma_ but it's really frustrating because we also have to replace our roof :-/
I wanted to go out but I couldn't take my small kids. I hadn't ever had a babysitter but I knew my sister would take good care of them. 
They did great. I knew I was worried for nothing!
All my friends signed up for horse back riding lessons but I'd never been before and was scared.  They convinced me to sign up and take them!
I wouldn't say it was a good time but I'm glad I tried it!
If we can believe and trust in each other_comma_the world will be a better place
Is not an easy task but we can try
I had a c-section scheduled to have my baby. I was very excited about seeing her but very nervous about the surgery. 
I had the surgery and everything went great. I was glad it was over! 
Some of my collegues wete sacked by the management
Honestly_comma_i was just lucky not to be among
I had an okay job_comma_ not a great job but it paid well_comma_ working as a commercial truck and trailer repair technician. After a few weeks on the job I fell into a deep depression after getting injured at work.
No_comma_ it was minor. I had a previous injury to my arm_comma_ not sure what is messed up in it really... Doctor said it was just a sprained wrist but it was obivously more serious_comma_ the doctor didn't really care.
I haven't gotten it looked at since_comma_ it doesn't bother me enough to warrant spending the money on the doctor visit. It's alright for the most part now_comma_ thank you for your concern. My shoulder and elbow pop consistently but it rarely aches these days_comma_ though using the computer mouse can give me fits if I don't watch it.
i farted in a barnes and noble once and someone smelled it.
haha I guess so. But they knew it was me...
yeah you're right I shouldn't feel so bad then.
I was looking through pictures of when my kids were young. I can't believe how tiny they were. It made me remember the times when they were tiny. 
They were so sweet and little. Time passes so quickly. 
I am worried about going back to school_comma_ I don't know if I should do it. It can be hard.
you're right! I guess I am just very cautious you know.
I spent 2 hours helping my daughter with her homework. I found out today she never turned it in.
She just didn't bother. She won't even get credit for turning it in late. What a waste of time.
No_comma_ your right. That is so true. I just wish she put more effort into school instead of talking in class.
I had just went on my break after a long morning at work_comma_ so I got chipotle. As soon as I stepped out of my car with my food_comma_ I dropped my bowl on the floor
It was pretty heartbreaking honestly_comma_ I really looked forward to my steak bowl. I just ended up getting some chips from the vending machine to fill my stomach at least a bit
It is good to remain faithful if you are married. Faith and trust are important in a healthy relationship.
I have been married for 14 years now. We've had our ups and downs_comma_ but a good relationship takes work.
Compromise an important part_comma_ too. It can't work if someone insists on being right all the time.
I broke my glasses so I had to wear an old pair that had visible scratches on the lenses from being stored in a drawer.
Well_comma_ it felt so self-conscious knowing that people could probably see the scratches.
That part sucked too. Guess I care too much what others think.
I am going through a breakup_comma_ we were together for five years I am heartbroken
it's horrible. I know you felt the same way. I just want this terrible feeling to be over.
You ever have a situation where you help someone out and just end up regretting it?
Yea_comma_ I once let this guy crash on my couch rent free for 3 months_comma_ and the entire time he was taking money out my room and eating my snacks without saying anything. I knew things were missing_comma_ but he'd always deny it.
Thanks_comma_ I guess some people are just scumbags. I don't understand how you can take advantage of someone who is helping you.
An old friend wanted to get together. IT was a guy_comma_ and he was someone I was involved with. I knew it would bother my husband so I didn't meet with him. 
I didn't want to make my husband uncomfortable_comma_ even if it would have been nice to catch up. But I have to respect him. 
I have to go to the dentist really soon. One of my teeth are really sensitive lately.
Yes_comma_ that is true. I am one of those people who hate the dentist.
I will make myself go. thanks!
I have meditated nearly every day this year. It was my new years resolution.
Yes! It is surprising how much it has helped me considering how neurotic I can be.
Wow_comma_ I'm not sure if I could do that. Did you feel scared?
Of doing a trust fall_comma_ I guess I forgot to mention that part.
No worries_comma_ was just thinking back to when a group of my friend when to scout camp and were doing trust exercises. 
I dont like borrowing from people
I like to manage whatever i have
I asked my son to clean the kitchen. He left dirty dishes in the sink and garbage on the counter.
He's 10 but definitely messy. We are working on it though.
Do you like theme park rides? I used to enjoy them a lot_comma_ but one time my ride got stuck.
It really was_comma_ I was freaking out_comma_ but I also felt confident that we'd be saved. It didn't take too long_comma_ maybe 5-10 minutes before they were able to rescue us.
Jeeze_comma_ man. I wonder how many other people have gotten stuck on rides before. Is it that common of an occurrence? Well_comma_ we're both here to talk about it. 
When he was little_comma_ my nephew was so adorable. He was the first child in the family for a long time_comma_ and he was so cute. I loved to spend time with him. 
Oh he's still nice. He has some issues_comma_ though_comma_ but I love him very much of course.
Intuition can be a key tool to a seasoned nurse. 
Those are very beneficial tools as well but sometimes experience plays a large part in patient outcomes. 
Skills can be difficult to learn from a book. Hands-on practice is what it takes to perfect those skills.
It's always such a great feeling whenever I get home and my dog is there waiting for me at the door ready to greet me.
I have a little havanese named Yoko. 
Hi_comma_ I want to tell you about one time my faith was tested. Have you ever had a time when you had to just put your faith in God?
I can understand that. That's why I said my faith was tested...when my husband and I were younger couple with small kids_comma_ we were living on a small budget. My husband was still in college to be a teacher_comma_ so it was pretty tight with just my income. Well_comma_ long story short_comma_ I wrote a check for $40 as tithe at church and that was pretty much all we had. A few days later I received a care package from my mom out of blue and she even included some cash. It was not something she usually did. What do you think of that?
Yup_comma_ sometimes you just have to believe_comma_ I think. But I did feel convicted to do so. I'm not saying everyone should do it. You know what I mean?
It was nice talking to you. Have a great night. Best wishes!
my cat just recently died and I am very shaken up about it.
it is I am just so sad and heartbroken
We went over my grandmother's house one holiday. Everyone was spending quality time together and cooking and it was just so special. 
Yes_comma_ it was. My family usually is far_comma_ but some people came into town. It was just nice to be together. 
My friend lost an expensive phone.
Yeah she even cried about it and I had to comfort her.
I joined the Army when I was 18 because I didn't know what else to do. I was so nervous!
Physically it wasn't too difficult. It was mentally difficult though. 
I am glad I did it. I wasn't glad at the time though. 
Ugh. My boss called me into his office today...and he didn't even give a reason. 
Something lame -- he wanted to see if I completed a poster he wanted. Why couldn't he have asked that over the phone?
My mom became very ill recently and had to be hospitalized.
She's doing fine now. But that was the first time I've seen her ill. Scary.
Thanks.
I worked so hard on my science project in school. I thought I was going to get first place. I didn't and was so upset.
I got second place_comma_ but I was so upset I didn't get first_comma_ it might as well have been last. I was young.
One time when i was young and i didn't know how to swim I jumped in the pool knowing my dad was watching me.
A little. I remember being choked up some but he jumped in there and got me out quickly.
totally hope not!
Last week I was cooking dinner. I dropped a hotdog on the floor and ended up giving it to my child.
I rinsed it off. No one saw it but I feel bad about it now.
My husband is very trustworthy_comma_ he's good at keeping a secret when asked to
True_comma_ we've been together for over 20 years. Feeling comfortable in a relationship is important
That is so true_comma_ it's sad to see people break up whether they are married or not or have children or not.
I as not invited for unknown reasons_comma_but i wish to be there
Its my friend's birthday
When I was in high school I borrowed my parents car_comma_ and got into an accident. Of course like most human teenagers I tried to cover it up but they found out.
No I was fine_comma_ just my pride was wounded. Of course_comma_ being a human being and not a robot I was overwhelmed by the lie. I fessed up to them eventually.
No I was grounded for a very long time and couldn't hang out with my friends.
My husband used to tell me to go to sleep at night when my daughter was born. I didn't want to go to sleep because I didn't want to miss a moment with her. 
My husband didn't get it. He thought I was crazy. Oh well..... 
Yeah_comma_ thats true. He still thinks I am crazy. I am okay with that. Crazy does not always have to be a bad thing. 
I have a job that requires me to work out of town.
Yes _comma_ but its nice to have some one at home who will handle things while you are away.
They don't make do with what they have
Envious people
There is no better feeling than being greeted at the door by your dog
You bet. As soon as she hears the door horn when I lock my car_comma_ I can hear her barking from inside
She is a very sweet girl
This weekend i'm going to the beach. It's been so long!
Oh_comma_ I plan too. It's one of my favorite places to have fun.
My brother went out of town last month and asked me if I would water his plants for him while he was away.
he lives only about 5 miles. I got so caught up in myself I forgot to water his plants and they all died.
Oh yes_comma_  it was an embarrassing moment
I got a hot slap from a lady
Hi! So recently I applied for this barista job. I've been waiting forever for them to get back to me!
They just called me back today. I didn't get the job. :( I was trying not to be overconfident. I guess it worked this time lol.
I hope so! I was actually really surprised. I think they like me there. I just hate not knowing what I'll be doing next!
So I've been having an issue with my neighbor. It's not super hairy yet but it could be. They constantly back into my mailbox on their way out almost every day.
It's been knocked down a few times yes. Police have been involved but they don't do anything. My neighbor is so carefree about it too_comma_ it's bonkers!
We've "chatted" about it for sure. Like I said_comma_ the guy doesn't really care. Very unnerving.
Ahaha that sounds tempting_comma_ but I try to take the high road on this one because it's already driving me up a wall.
I remeber once I had a job where I worked on a farm. I did a lot things their I had never done before in my life.
Well once I was asked to check a hefer to see if it was pregnant. And this required some skills I didn't have.
I have a son who's 8 months old! I get so nostalgic about how quickly time has passing_comma_ and it hasn't even been a year!
Yes they grow so fast! It really motivates me to make the most of the time we have though.
I recently had a baby! It was such an incredible feeling seeing his face for the first time.
Thank you! His name is Ronan. He is such a sweetie! I've never loved anyone so much in my life.
Hi! I'm so excited! My husband and I decided to temporarily relocate to Arizona this winter!
You should! Have you?

Yes I did . But ignored my instincts and sure enough some thing bad did happen _comma_ can you imagine how I felt after that.
Hey dude! I'm so pumped. I just got a beautiful new dress for my friend's wedding. 
It is! It's in just a few weeks! Do you ever get a piece of clothing or something that just makes you feel amazing?
Hi_comma_ a few years ago_comma_ my husband got a job offer in Hawaii. We LOVE Hawaii_comma_ but we didn't know anyone there and you know how expensive it is to live there. We really had to think about that move...
Yeah_comma_ but we did move and it ended up the best decision ever! We had so much fun and really loved living there. At least beaches are always free!
my friend joined the airforce and became an air traffic controller.
I'm not sure but then they got out and became a police officer and is now a detective!
Yes_comma_ I believe they have already. I'm so proud.
A guy asked me on a date one_comma_ knowing I was married.  I denied_comma_ of course_comma_ but was shocked that he didn't care that I was in a monogamous relationship.
Or boost his ego? Either way_comma_ he didn't succeed.
I had my first professional interview recently! 
Pretty well I think! I had a solid resume_comma_ and I practiced ahead of time. It still isn't the same though when you're right there in the room and they're looking at you lol.
Do you ever feel like time is just going by way too fast?
Exactly! I have an 8 month old son and I feel like he is growing up so quickly. It's like he was just a noisy little bean yesterday.
I have been wanting to buy a massage table for my business. 
Kind of. I'm a Reiki therapist and I got good news! my mom gave me a huge gift card for my birthday and I can now afford the table!
Oh_comma_ I am. Can't wait to get my first customer.
Hey. How are you?
Oh not much. I got a crappy text from a friend the other day! I never have friend drama so it's really sucky.
I just moved to a new town recently and I finally made a new friend! I was starting to feel really lonely so it's nice to feel like I might fit in.
Aw_comma_ thank you! Do you live in a small town? It's very hard to make connections!
So! My husband's cat pooped and peed in the bathtub today. That was rough.
Haha! Nope. Never again.
I'm so bummed! My best friend is moving away to Brazil.
I don't know... I hope not for her sake. I was really hoping she'd stay here but I'm also really excited for her.
She is starting a missionary school!
When I was 13 I was baptized. In water_comma_ not milk. But if I was baptized in milk it would be whole milk.
Honestly? Not fat.
I just celebrated my 2 year anniversary! I've been reminiscing about my wedding a lot lately lol.
Sorry! We eloped anyway so it wasn't that exciting lol!
Hi! Have you been to a rodeo?
Do it! It's so fun. I'm so impressed with the skill of some of the riders!
I don't work or really go anywhere. I feel like I'm always waiting.
Usually it's for my boyfriend to get home so he can spend time with me. poor guy. lol
Good evening! I moved to a small town recently. It's been tough.
I'm sure it will. I've already made some friends_comma_ but it's definitely difficult to make connections.
I feel soo far away from my family.
No_comma_my mom even live here in town. we hardly ever talk anymore.
It's ok. I'm gonna let them know how I feel. maybe change things.
I'm so excited to relocate to AZ for my husband's work (temporarily)_comma_ but kinda scared!
I don't know anyone there and all my family is a 22 hour drive away

oh no_comma_ no that one. The other one does sleep right next to my head though
It was such a nerve wrecking experience when my son was first born_comma_ I really was so scared that anything could hurt him!
I know_comma_ right_comma_ and I had this nurse tell me the first week he was alive_comma_ that babies have died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome right in their parents arm! It was so scary
My friend recently told me that she couldn't have kids_comma_ I tried my hardest to be there for her
She is not at all_comma_ I have really been there for her_comma_ I have two boys of my own and could not imagine not being able to have kids of my own
One night my cats were chasing a fly in the house. All of a sudden_comma_ one of them started acting weird and then he died. He was only a kitten. I was so upset.
Yes_comma_ it was horrible. It just happened out of nowhere.
The vet said it was likely an anneurysm.
I am so happy with my life currently_comma_ I am able to stay at home with my children and watch them grow_comma_ I would not change it for anything
I have 2 little boys aged 2 and 4_comma_ soon to be 3 and 5 and ugh it can be challenging at times_comma_ but totally worth it!
I went out to the bar recently with my girlfriends and it was kind of an annoying experience. 
It's just so frustrating going out when you are in a happily committed relationship and getting hit on. Especially when you tell the men straight up you are involved with someone else!
My grandma was diagnosed with dementia a few years ago. She recently moved in with my dad. I went and stayed with them to take care of her.
I went to school to be a CNA. So the actual taking care of her was not difficult. I think it was more mentally difficult. It was all day and all night. Very exhausting.
Unfortunately she wont get better. She will be moving into a nursing home in a couple of weeks. I think it will be good for her.
The other week_comma_ I was talking about a co-working of mine - okay_comma_ I was gossiping..  
Pretty awful_comma_ actually.  Especially considering that the coworker of whom I was speaking was in a room just next door with the door open.  
Absolutely.  I really am disgusted with myself.  I don't know why I open my big mouth!
I have never cheated on a girlfriend
Yes im kinda proud of it
I felt so ashamed the time that I took money from my parents. I couldn't look them in the eyes for weeks when I was younger.
Yeah... I don't know. They still support me and help me_comma_ but I still feel incredibly guilty. Not sure what to do to make it up to them.
I took the kids to visit the residents at the Veterans Home. We made some special treats to take to them.
A variety of things that they liked. I checked ahead of time to see what they would want.
I called in sick to work_comma_ so I could go Christmas shopping...they were having a great sale at the mall.
Well_comma_ yeah_comma_ it's good to plan ahead_comma_ but I kept looking over my shoulder...I felt so guilty!
I made a big pot of Vegetable soup. After eating a big bowl I was completely satisfied and just wanted to nap in my chair.
Oh yeah_comma_ It felt so good. 
My girlfriend is always worrying if I am as happy thought I would be after we decided to go from just good friends to be in a relationship with each other.  I always am honest and tell her the same thing.
well really we have deeply involed for along time now . And I am very happy in our relationship and couldn't ask for anything more out of it.
My friend recently lended me their car so I can go out of town
They did not hesitate to lend me the car at all which is nice. No_comma_ I did not have any problems with the car. 
My car was getting repaired. 
When my nephew's car broke down and I loaned him my car_comma_ I know that he'll be careful with it.
Yeah_comma_ 18 is an inherently irresponsible time_comma_ mine is 24 and getting married soon so that makes a lot of difference.
The culture that extends adolescence deep into their twenties doesn't help much either. 
Long time ago_comma_ we saw a driver throw a kitten out of his car window. We picked him up and brought him home.
He was such a sweet kitten. We had him for years. He's gone now and miss him still.
My husband has a job interview coming up and we re really hoping he'd get the job.
It's for health care company. It'll be a better job for him. Thank you.
I had my eye on a pretty new shirt that I wanted to get. My sister got it and it looked great on her. I was so envious.
I wasn't nervous I was envious. I had really wanted it.
My friend is on her third vacation this year and now she's on a Hawaii cruise!
A big fat ZERO! I need one now! Haha!
Have you ever invited someone over for dinner that you liked a whole lot? Well I have and it didn't go to well.
Well I made them dinner fixed their plate gave it to them and a folded napkin. When they unfolded the napkin a big fat and I mean fat cock roach fell out and ran across the table at about 50 miles a hour.
once i pooped my pants at walmart
My mom was there and i had to ride home with her so yeah she knew
I was on the edge of my seat watching the local election results. I was hoping my candidate would win.
No I was quite happy with the results. But the waiting for the results was so nerve wracking.
The weather forecast called for tropical storm force winds. I made sure that I checked the yard for loose items.
I live on the Gulf Coast. When you get the warning you have to be ready.
I got caught by the train and it made me late for work. I was so mad.
That's just it though. You never know when the train is going to be there.
it sucked i was heartbroken but i let her go
its okay and thanks it was 2 years ago_comma_ she texted me that she wasn't interested in a relationship and then i found out a week later
thanks man! i hope you do too
I knew my wife's family would help us financially for our marriage_comma_ turns out it was right_comma_ I appreciate it so much.
Yes well we needed money in order to get married in the first place. All the expenses and fees and paperwork.
There was a time when I really messed up.
Some folks were counting on me to buy some things_comma_ but I never did.
What?  I ordered the items later_comma_ but they came later than folks had hoped.
I behaved immature during the fight lately and lied_comma_ later on I felt remorse.
It was my wife_comma_ sadly. I explained to her later and admitted my mistake. 
I quit my job without having another one lined up.  I'm hopeful and optimistic that I will be okay and that this was the right choice.
I'm doing some work-from-home stuff and it's actually pretty fun!
I don't know why my boyfriend lied to me about seeing another woman. I thought he loved me.
I'm not sure_comma_ but I'm hoping that he will realize he's messed up.
Thank you so much. Hopefully_comma_ it all works out_comma_ and he comes back to me.
 really shameful was that I would be the same as I would happen the same
nothing forgot I wanted to tell you that today I was upset with my sister
 because I take money without asking permission
Don't you hate it when you are not sure you can trust someone?
My son went on a field trip and needed some money for a snack and drink.  Unfortunately_comma_ I only had a $20.
I was nervous_comma_ but had to trust him.  I was afraid he would spend it all or even lose it.
Hey_comma_ guess what_comma_ you will not believe what just happened to me. 
I let a stranger borrow my cellphone to make a phone call_comma_ but he ended up dashing off with my phone
No_comma_ I have lent my phone out to strangers before_comma_ and have never had someone run off with it. Luckily track and field training paid off and I was able to tackle him down
Lately I was sharing memories with my wife from before we got married and it was heartwarming.
We met online actually! And we were across the ocean from each other. That was a journey.
I miss the good old days when we would be given pancakes on Tuesdays at school. I loved pancake Tuesdays. 
Haha yeah_comma_ but it doesn't feel the same because I miss being able to enjoy it with all my classmates. It was always a great time full of laughter and chatter
Have you ever tried skydiving before?
I thought I was going to pee my pants until the instructor told me how many years of experience he has under his belt. 
yeah_comma_ it is. 15 years and over 500 jumps helped ease my anxiety lol
How old were you the first time you ever drove a vehicle?
That's ironic. I was 13. I decided to take my mom's van for a joyride.
Unfortunately_comma_ yes. Never got in trouble with police_comma_ but I still get reminded of it from time to time_comma_ even 10 years later.
I let a stranger borrow my cellphone to make a phone call_comma_ but he ended up dashing off with my phone
No_comma_ but what was even more devastating was that there was a forest fire in the area_comma_ so I also ended up losing my house :( 
I went out with the girls and didn't cheat on my bf
well he
I know but I'm so proud of myself
I've been anxious because I think my new landlords don't approve of dogs in the house I'm renting and I have a dog!
Really? I did not know such laws exist but it's awesome. Where do you live?
My mother has been diagnosed with diabetes_comma_ so I have been taking care of her diet. I am worried about her health
Yes she is_comma_ I really love her because she has brought e up all on her own
The spilled soda echoed so loudly  in the library it was embarrasing
a few I could have  melter
this is true
I'm so annoyed_comma_ a coworker of mine was asking me questions about an argument that happened between me and another coworker and I told her what was the problem and then we talked a bout it_comma_ I thought she was concerned because I seemed upset but the next day she started telling everyone to make me look like a bad person
Yes and I learned my lesson I won't confide so easily to people !
When moving out of my old family home_comma_ I came across a few bags of stuffed animals I had as a kid. Probably 20 animals total.
I'd say so. I had a big imagination as a child_comma_ but that was replaced by other interests as I matured.
I am so happy_comma_ my son has just got into med school!
Yes he sure did_comma_ 5 years of hard work at university completing his masters degree in biology!
Few years earlier_comma_ I was almost going to end a frienship with my frind after hearing that he was talking bad things about me. It was a bad experience after all. Sometimes I share that experience with you guys
no. I did not believe that and I continued my friendship. 
Thank you for your kind words. Friendship is very important after all
I am looking forward to my wedding date! Of course you are also invited! :) 
Yes it sure is_comma_ I have know Chris since we were 5 years old. I can not believe we have finally come this far and are getting married! 
I tripped over my foot and landed face first in front of a group of hot jocks. I am so embarrassed!
Haha_comma_ yes you are totally right! I am sure they will forget about it soon :) 
My best friend is  keeping all of my life's savings at her house
i spend way too much money
I do
My grandfather passed away_comma_ and when I found out it had already been several weeks after the funeral happened.
Unfortunately it's a very long ways away. I hope someday too_comma_ though. It's important_comma_ if only for closure. 
I saw my boyfriend with another girl yesterday and they were sitting shoulder to shoulder next to each other...it made me so jealous
Yes me too_comma_ I did not want to seem like a jealous stalker so I didn't stay behind to find out what happened afterwards.
I know I can pass my calculus test today!
I want to shoot for at least a 90-100%.  Can you believe all I needed was a tutor
I am totally going to win first place tomorrow in the biology contest! I studied for months for this! 
Thanks_comma_ I am only worried about missing my school bus to school 
I always sleep through my alarms
My mom passed away it's still so hard
Thank you just one day at at a time
I am trying to get to that poin
I have all my ingredients ready for the baking contest tomorrow! I am so excited to cook against high class chefs
Yes I have I can decorate a cake in less than 30 minutes! :) 
Hi Bob
I had an issue with a friend the other day
Yeah_comma_ i don't know if I can trust him anymore
I am so mad_comma_ my dog ate my homework that I spend 2 hours on_comma_ so now I have to redo the whole thing! 
I guess I will just have to redo everything if my teacher does not believe me :( 
I have been married to my husband for 40 years and still love him with all my heart
Yes I totally agree_comma_ we are celebrating our 41 year anniversary tomorrow :) 
Hello
I am doing fine.  How are you?
That is is true.  I am up thinking about my relationship with my deceased wife.
The first night I finally moved into my new place was very nice. I finally had my own spot_comma_ to myself_comma_ and the means to afford it comfortably.
It's pretty liberating. Would be hard to come back from that freedom though. Hard to imagine it.
I accidentally took my friend's food and felt very embarrassed after.
Nothing_comma_ I had just mistaken it for my food but when I realized it wasn't_comma_ I became red in the face.
I am hopeful that I will get into law school this year. I studied really hard for it. 
Yes I did_comma_ I spent 4 hours every day for a whole year studying for this test to get into law school. 
Today I needed to take my dog to the vet but I couldn't so I asked my sister to go. I am sure she will be able to handle it.
Yes she is fine_comma_ it is just for a check up. I am sure my sister will not have any problems.
I just ate the most disgusting thing ever! 
I ate meal worms! They were still alive and I could feel them crawling in my mouth
I misunderstood what someone said to me_comma_ I tried to help but in turn it all turned out awkward and the conversation went wrong.
They kind of went off on me ad disagreed. What I said wasn't offensive_comma_ just irrelevant though lol.
I was throwing away my old stuff when I came across my old toys but I could not throw them out because they meant so much to me.
That is true_comma_ they have survived staying with me all these years because they brought me so much joy.
I am feeling anxious about my test tomorrow 
No i completely forgot about it so I have been cramming all night :(
I am terrified of spiders_comma_ one time I saw one on my wall and stared at it for hours to keep track of where it was 
It's all their legs and eyes...*shivers* just imagining it gives me chills up my spine!
When I was in middle school_comma_ I remember seeing a question on the board and feeling positive that I knew the answer. When all was quiet and the teacher asked if anyone knew the answer_comma_ I confidently spoke up_comma_ only to be incorrect
An odd combination of wanting to die_comma_ and not wanting to exist. Like_comma_ I basically wanted to reverse time. 
I wanted to try out a new brand of headphones but instead stuck with the good old Beats. I was loyal to them.
Tried and tested is safe!
My son was extremely sick but I had to be at work that day so I had to leave him with my mother in law
Much better_comma_ and I knew she would take good care of him
I feel so guilty_comma_ I promised my friend I would come to her birthday party but forgot about it
You are brilliant! I can't believe I did not think of that_comma_ I will definitely get her some sweets to make it up to her 
 I am so happy I just got a new puppy! 
Yes of course! He is the cutest pup_comma_ and full of energy! 
I saw someone who was making much more money than me doing a the same thing as me but a very bad job. But I still wished I was on their place and paid as much
Yeah well I'm online entrepreneur so it's more complicated. I don't want to charge as much at the same time. They're kind of scamming people but I still felt envious_comma_ then got over it.
My grandmother became sick recently so I have taken some time off work to nurse her.
Thank you_comma_ slowly each day she is getting back onto her feet.
I had a cancer scare last year.  My doctor found a strange mole. I had to wait a week for the biopsy to come back.  It was a long wait!
Xanax!  Just kidding.  I didn't have much help dealing with it because I didn't tell anyone.
In retrospect!  I was pretty freaked out.  My family was mad at me for not telling them_comma_ but I didn't want them to worry.
I felt really guilty when I had to tell my parents I decided to drop out of school.
How did you guess? I was told a lot of things that day.
My brother got such a nice Snowboard for his birthday when we were teenagers. I wanted one too_comma_ but didn't end up getting what I wanted
You know_comma_ he played it up like that_comma_ seemed really invested in the Bass guitar I got. He sure did enjoy the hell out of that snowboard_comma_ though. 
I am terrified of clowns
Yes_comma_ I hate the makeup they wear_comma_ it is just so creepy!
I'm starting a music career professionally and believe I can do it in alternative industry!
Me and my wife are musicians and are forming a duo together with her singing_comma_ I play guitar and piano and she sings.
 am so impressed by my daughter_comma_ she won the national spelling bee contest!
I really am! She is only 7 years old_comma_ but already won her first national contest! :) 
I just finished my last exam and am very relieved to be finished!
Yes_comma_ it feels like all the hard work I put into studying has paid off.
I studied my drivers test book page to page for two weeks leading up to the test. Went in with all the confidence in the world
Nailed it_comma_ 100%. Turns out I learned you don't gotta study all that much for a written drivers test.
Reflecting back on my youth_comma_ I remember all the times I'd steal candy bars from the convenience store on the way home from school
No. I'd stop in with a group of people walking home_comma_ and slyly take my pick while others were legitimately buying.
I recently got to move to the city I've always wanted to live in and I couldn't be happier!
I am! It also means I don't have to drive anymore_comma_ which I'm super excited about.
I have never felt more anticipation than the months I waited to hear if I got accepted into grad school or not.
Yes I got accepted! It was worth the wait.
One of my more embarrassing moments was when I was jumping over my backpack and my foot got caught in the handle. It's the only time I've ever actually fallen on my face.
Quite a few_comma_ but I knew most of them. I consider that better than falling in front of a bunch of strangers.
Once my dog got really sick. It was scary but I decided to completely trust my vet and he's still healthy today.
Definitely. I moved and it's been hard to find a replacement.
I got a call from my sister's boyfriend that she was in a car wreck and was being life-flighted to the hospital with no information on her condition. Just that I need to get there quick.
It was a nightmare because I had a two hour drive to get to where she was with no update on her at all. The unknown during that time was horrific. But_comma_ yes_comma_ she will be ok.
I love my dog. The way we are faithful to eachother...there is no other bond like it.
My dog's name is Blu. She's an American Bulldog and close to 100 pounds.
Started a new job_comma_ it's so different from what I always have done.
I do_comma_ just hard work_comma_ used to sitting at a desk.
Hope so_comma_ my muscles are sore right now.  
I work at a dairy plant in San Antonio. I work in a small group and they are very close to me. It's humbling to have a close knit group of guys who have your back on things. 
Absolutely_comma_ these guys and me usually try to bust out our work quickly and have some downtime to hang out when time permits. I pasteurize milk for a living and it's a lot of fun.
It's the process of killing yeast_comma_ mold and bacteria. You basically heat up the milk to about 190 degrees and kill all the nasty bacteria.
While in grad school I missed out on a Foo Fighters concert my friends went to; I was really jealous.
I just had to study for the four tests I had coming up_comma_ but I got to see a bunch of cool videos from my friends.
I don't believe that you have! It is not available yet!
Well_comma_ I guess it should come up soon.
I'm waiting on more money coming in_comma_ I'm starting a new business so fingers crossed!
Yeah me too! I'm feeling prepared so we'll see.
I use to be very trusting until 8 years ago.
3 people I thought were my friends attacked me out of the blue and left me for dead. I have had a hard time making friends since then.
I'm going to a Braves game tomorrow for the first time and I'm a little apprehensive.
I love baseball_comma_ I just have social anxiety and I'm a little concerned with how I will react being in such a large crowd.
It really shook me up when my wife filled for divorce 2 years ago. She gave me no warning and hired a lawyer right away.
Non whatsoever_comma_ when I found out she had already left to her moms house_comma_ no text or anything. She had left a note on the table
That she was taking the kids and leaving_comma_ that she was tired of the way things were going. And that she had hired a lawyer to begin filling for divorce.
Our home is paid off
About 3 years.  Used the money from the last house and put it all on this one.
Worth the effort to do it_comma_ now work part time_comma_ mortgage is the biggest expense
I've been having to deal with me and my wife's new business and it's been kind of stressful.
A spiritual service business.
I love living in my own house_comma_ it's a place where I can sit back and enjoy myself. I feel like i'm king of the castle.
I have my wife with me as well. I feel like I can set up a good future for us with this house.
Hello.
Well... I'm feeling incredibly guilty!
I am OK. I'm trying to get in shape for my wedding_comma_ but somehow managed to eat just about everything unhealthy in the house! So ashamed of myself!
On my first date with my wife we got so drunk that I ended up wetting the bed!
She did! She didn't tell me though for years!
Absolutely silly! I never knew that was possible!
I've been trying to cheer my mom up a lot lately. She's kind of been struggling. 
Yeah_comma_ especially since I live so far away from her. I let her video chat with my kids a lot to hopefully bring some happiness back into her days.
It was my turn and i was called up to sing_comma_ While singing_comma_ i noticed my trouser zip was full open because it had spoiled. It was really embarrassing and i felt really ashamed of myself
yes_comma_ i had to give them a signal so i can leave the stage
Being a mom is such a struggle sometimes. On the one hand I really enjoy the break I get when my son stays with his grandparents. On the other I always feel a bit off kilter when he's not home with me.
Absolutely! I can get so much done_comma_ but I really do prefer him to just be home with me. All seems right with the world when he's here.
I was feeling extremely nervous. I was about to go on stage in front of 4000 people. Almost couldn't believe that it was happening!
I was delivering a presentation on leadership behaviours.
It went extremely well. Was nervous at first but hopefully nobody noticed!
My uncle died in the hospital_comma_  he had malaria _comma_ till now_comma_  I've not been myself 
I'm telling you_comma_  it's so hard.  He helped to train me to school 
I have a long cruise coming up
It is for 14 days_comma_ wish it was longer_comma_ but so looking forward to it
My neighbor jokingly makes fun of me for a comment I made that came out very wrong. I turn red every time he mentions it now.
Yes_comma_ he and his wife are some of our best friends!
I almost made the biggest mistake of my life and cost me the greatest thing that ever happened to me. But I sobered up and didn't do it.
I had gotten into a huge fight with my girlfriend so I went out with some buddies and started chatting and flirting with this beautiful woman at the bard.
I tried a new slushie flavor tonight. It sounded very good but it wasn't. Such a letdown.
Sometimes things just don't work out. 
I felt i wouldnt succeed_comma_
I took exams and got tensed when the result did not show up
Have you ever been hurt so bad by someone that you thought to yourself that you would NEVER put yourself in a position to get hurt again?
My ex-husband and now I'm just getting ready to start dating again- But its so scary.
My husband and I have been married for 5 years but sometimes I still get annoyed with other women. We went to the bar recently and he was off with his friends when I noticed a girl trying desperately to get his attention.
For sure! I just don't understand why people have to do that. He wears a wedding ring all the time and we have kids!
I went to empty the trash outside and the can was covered with maggots.
It was so gross. I felt like I was going to throw up.
I refused to take my neighbors properties because what I had was enough for me
Not really_comma_  he wanted me as a girlfriend 
i have faith in a brighter future
i believe in society and the work the government is providing for us!
because they are just very trustworthy!
Took the wife to the club_comma_ big mistake.
All the guys hitting on her_comma_  only good thing is free drinks for her.  lol
I was in a meeting when someone accused me of stealing his money_comma_  it was so tough on me
Seriously_comma_  it was not funny_comma_  but the truth came out finally 
I have to teach an in-service class at work next week. I am feeling a bit uneasy about doing it.
I'm hesitant because I get nervous in front of groups.
I had to give a presentation at an international conference recently. I was terrified!
It turned out okay_comma_ thankfully! I was nervous for nothing!
i have so much faith in my wife .
i really love her_comma_ it's amazing how when u lose all hope life shows you that everything happens for a reason. that's probably why i met her!
I felt ashamed when I haven't made an effort on my appearance then head outside into the public
That's a good boost for me and I appreciate that. I just always worry about what people see first about me
I felt a little bad the other day because I got upset with my son. He always panics when I have to buzz his hair and I was so frustrated. 
I think it is just the noise of the buzzer that makes him nervous_comma_ but he literally just screams and cries. It definitely doesn't hurt him at all.
I had just moved into a new house and when I came home from work there was a giant spider crawling around.
I am scared too. I took my shoe off and threw it across the room and hit it dead on. I could not believe that I hit it.
It was just me and the dog so I had to make the shot.
I let my wife deal with all the finances.  I rely on her to do the right thing with it.  I am cool with that.
If she does_comma_ it's no big deal.  We all die in the end.
Nothing matters.
i feel very hopeful for the future
look at the bright side! soon the robots will take over and we won't be there so no one can hurt anyone anymore.
I was scrolling through Twitch the other day and saw someone playing Super Mario 64. I had to start watching right away because that was probably the first video game I ever played!
Very much! My dad and I used to play it all the time when I was little. We would compete to see who could get the most stars.
i care about my wife and i always want the best for her 
it is so beautiful when you can just rely on them and not even overthink about it.
I trust my boyfriend so much when he lives in Holland and I live in the UK
I trust him with all my heart because he has my back!
in that situation i felt proud by my father 
my father was a honest man_comma_ the shop owner also knows him 
Have you lost a parent?
Yeah_comma_ I found out while going through my fathers things that he kept everything I had every handmade for him.
my cat's an outdoor cat that i let out to have fun_comma_ and i just found out he was run over by a car yesterday
he was only 3 and now he's gone forever_comma_ and i'm the one who did it
yeah but i should've known the cars were going to get him. he was black and white and now he's red all over
Do you have any animals? I have one but have been thinking about getting another.
Yeah_comma_ I have a 14 year old cat and work long hours. I've been thinking about almost getting him a new kittne.
i've never kissed a girl before and my girlfriend and i are going to kiss for the first time tomorrow night_comma_ and i know she's going to make me feel safe and special
oh yeah but im putting my heart in her hands and i know we'll have a great time
32
i was in the train the other day and i fell and everyone started laughing at me
i just got my knee bruised_comma_ and it really was embarrassing
I got to see Stephen King on his book tour for his new novel. He was handing out 100 signed books_comma_ but I didn't get one.
Yeah I was really hoping to get one. It was still pretty amazing to see him speak live though!
im just sitting here with my cat in my lap and thinking about all the money in my bank account. life is good
let's just say it's mine to keep_comma_ and now everything is taken care of. i dont have a care in the world
yeah and now my cat gets the nice treats
haha for sure. im going to get 10 more and treat them like kings
I was so mad when I came out of the salon with different hair color than I asked for
I asked for blonde_comma_ I came out as a brunette
I know I was crying_comma_ I will go and get it done by someone else
5
Sorry I hit the wrong button. I'm a teacher and I'm at a new school and my goal was NOT to make a fool of myself so of course first hour....I tripped over my stool and fell.
I've gotten this job opportunity but_comma_ I don't think it will be a good fit
Well_comma_ it's a factory job and I'm afraid that the monotony will be too soul-crushing
a girl i like at school told me today she doesn't like me in front of everyone
i walked away so i didnt do something stupid like HIT HER!
yep but don't worry. next week im going to walk right up to her and tell her *i* don't like *her*
and then im going to kiss the girl i actually like
i always question my ability and when that happens i envy people.
yes but it just feels bad to not be able to feel confident in myself and my abilities
i had my friend over and my family started saying stuff that made me so embarrassed
why don't you try harder next time?
i use to want to go to the dog show but never got to . But my friend got to go every time it came around.
It often made me mad. And it made me not like them .
I feel like I have let my family down. I got into trouble with the law. 
I lied to the cops about something I was questioned about. Truthfully_comma_ I didn't want other people to get into trouble. But instead_comma_ I was charged with making false statements to the police. 
That is entirely true. I was also worried about retribution from the other people. In the end_comma_ telling the truth is better than getting myself into trouble and letting my family down. 
I haven't been sleeping well for a few days now because my husband was on a 30 hour road trip to get our new puppy.
That's a great suggestion. Last night I actually did sleep a bit better because I opened the window and was able to listen to outdoor noises like crickets and cicadas. 
i am so prepared for my job interview today
computer engineering!
I did one of those water coasters the other day.
It was a blast.  Like a roller coaster on water.
god has done so much for me in my life. i owe everything to him
and i know he's going to come back for me and take me away from this place
i know he'll take care of me in heaven even if he hasn't taken care of me here on earth
thank you but i think can it apply to everyone even if you aren't religious
One time I was working on a huge project with a lot of people and made a huge mistake. Another person from another company could have embarassed me_comma_ but instead he helped me out and covered for me. 
I've never had that happen before either. It was a hostile environment and he certainly didn't have to help me_comma_ but he did. I've tried to be more like that since then.  
Haha. I doubt that. He was halfway around the world. It was a long time ago and he never asked for anything. 
Yes_comma_ it did. 
I was very disappointed that I was let go of a job I had had for years
They did provide severance. I wasn't sure what to do but felt that things would work out
Well_comma_ actually I did end up getting a job that I like!
Thanks! The wallet's still a bit skinny_comma_ but I like the job_comma_ though!
The other day I was going through my things and I found my old Gamecube. I remember all the fun times I had playing with friends.
Why certainly! It brought back memories of childhood and how carefree I used to be. I'd love to go back to those times.
Such is life but_comma_ the best we can do is find pieces of the old emotions we cherish in modern item. Like the smell of dishsoap my grandmother used to use.
My son sent me into an absolute panic at the grocery store the other day. He was only supposed to return his cart and instead he ran out the door!
Luckily a kind woman in line behind me went and brought him back. He'd only gone into the entryway to look at a gumball machine. 
I was really expectant anyway
That i will get the job
My husband went all out for our date night. I was quite pleased and his efforts had a big impact on me.
The attention to details were remarkable. It was a night to remember.
My false tooth came out while I was on a date with a guy I'd liked for months! It was horrible.
He did! I was eating some bread_comma_ and it came out and I didn't even notice. He was trying to say it without saying that my tooth was missing.

We didn't bother. At that point_comma_ we didn't want to use him anymore. 
I was arguing for a long time with someone_comma_ and then everyone found out i was wrong.
The thing was that it was my brother_comma_ so he will never let me forget it now.
They always come out at night
Am refering to ghost

Ah_comma_ that's brilliant and exciting_comma_ good for her! Hopefully something like that can happen for me too!

I started a new job recently at a pretty great restaurant owned by some pretty great people. I then was offered a higher pay by my previous employer to try and persuade me to come back. I had to turn it down_comma_ though. My new place is so good_comma_ that it would take a lot to make me leave.
Yeah_comma_ it's a rare thing sometimes. I plan to do this until I finish school_comma_ so for a little more than a year.
Probably not_comma_ since getting a specific job is the whole reason I'm going to school.

I got married very young at 18. This year we celebrated our 12 year anniversary.

its just nice to be able to be there for someone who needs you

No_comma_ it just feels yuck. It pretty much makes you lose your appetite.

i'm more into psychology and philosophy_comma_ but you should try everything everything it's a great novel!

Seriously! I wouldn't have never learned this stuff and would of had to spend hundred of dollars at a repair shop! 
My ten-year-old cat died a few weeks ago. I still can't believe he's gone.
Thanks. Whenever he wanted to come back into the house_comma_ he would call and I was the only person who seemed to hear him. I think we were connected_comma_ lol
I was at work the other day and this young lady started hitting on me for no reason. I told her I was married but she kept on trying to flirt with me.
I actually spoke with a manager about the situation and they moved me to another spot so I could work in peace. They told me if she starts again then take it to HR. Apparently she is known for that kind of behavior.
I ran like never before when I saw a black cat in my room
The sight of it scares me_comma_  I love the white one though_comma_  but not black 
Last December_comma_ my husband lost his job. He's our main source of income.
He has won now. But it was really rough for awhile. Especially Christmas.

They always neglt me
They dont worth my time
Today is the anniversary of my fathers death. He has been gone for 18 years now.
Thanks. It's hard all of the time but the anniversary always just brings it all back. Makes me feel really down.
I really felt so bad when I remembered how I stole my mum's money and my brother was punished for it
I'm trying so hard seriously 
I love my wife and kids. I sacrifice so much time for them all and it feels great!
I feel responsible for their future and I want to do everything I can for them!
Today at the grocery store my car was hit! He was on his phone!
Oh absolutely. Luckily I had a witness help testify that he was indeed on his phone.
My boss keeps putting off my employee review and it's really stressing me out.  
That's a good idea.  I'm just worried because she only has two employees and it'll be obvious it was me. 
That's certainly true.  If nothing happens by next week_comma_ I won't really have a choice.  Maybe I can consult with them confidentialy
During my birthday_comma_  my dad bought me a gold watch _comma_ I was so happy 
Oh yes _comma_ I longed for that you know _comma_ but he surprised me
"I was backing out of the driveway and I ran over a bike that I had told the kids to put away. I was so mad.
The bike was totaled and I had damage to the car. Needless to say somebody was in big trouble.
Everyone applauded me
I cleard my papers 
I was thinking about my childhood the other day. I came from a pretty good family and life was so nice and simple when you're young.
Yeah. I was going through some old VHS tapes and found some of when I was a kid. I used to love this old dog I had.
I thought I saw a ghost in my room_comma_  so I ran out of the house 
Lol_comma_  but do you know at the end_comma_  it was just a white cloth I hanged there
My nephew signed up to join the Marines. I was overwhelmed with happy emotions that he would choose to serve our country.
I think it is such an honorable thing to do. 
I felt sick to my stomach waiting in line for a new roller coaster.
Well_comma_ my fear didn't get any better as it started moving. But by the end I loved it!
Somehow I remember them being less scary when I was a kid 
I hung out with one of my old friends yesterday. We had a good time talking about the things we used to get into_comma_ back in the day.
Just general teenage tomfoolery. Nothing too serious. Silly things that kids do.
Do you have kids? Some of the things they do are nasty! My girlfriends kid is such a messy eater!
You're not kidding! When he eats spaghetti it's the worst. Pasta sauce gets everywhere!
I just found out a friend at work is pregnant!
Second actually. have to be a bit careful though.  We work around some dangerous chemicals.  
Not often.  We have a really good Health and Safety program.  
I came back home and noticed my younger brother kept everywhere clean_comma_ It pleased me
Oh yeah.  Because he hardly sweep
Found some old pictures of my Dad fishing. I miss fishing with him.
I used to love going with Dad_comma_ but haven't really gone much since he passed.

I felt on top of the world when i recieved the present
Yes_comma_it was a golden wrist watch from my dad
I found some kittens in an abandoned house recently. They were so malnourished_comma_ I took them home_comma_ fed them_comma_ and now they're part of the family.

I was diagnosed with a inguinal hernia yesterday. The amount of stress and anxiety is through the roof for me right now.
Yes with surgery. This is going to require some time off from work which may be difficult.
I've been married nearly eight years and someone hit on me last week. Luckily we have always been happy together or else that could have taken a weird turn.
It did! I guess I've 'still got it!' Ha!
Of course!
I felt pity on my boyfriend last week_comma_  but I wanted to leave him
No_comma_  he convinced me_comma_  so I stayed.  But don't like his attitude 
I bought a brand new jeep_comma_ and it's damaged already. I'm upset.
Someone crashed into it in a parking lot. Didn't even leave a note.
I agree. People can be such jerks sometimes.
i got permission to begin a start up company by my own.. i am so excited
yes.. it is unexpected indeed.. i thought i would be struggling to get support.. 
Lately at night when I go to sleep I've been having sleep paralysis. It feels terrifying! Like someone is in the room with me.
I've watched some Youtube videos on it and it seems to be hereditary or sometimes sleep deprived. I guess I am usually sleep deprived!
I moved house recently_comma_ from an absolute dump. The new place isn't huge_comma_ but it's perfect for me.
Well_comma_ I live alone_comma_ but I'm certainly proud of myself for finally moving. Now I can focus on work.
A few years ago_comma_ my employer of 13 years shut their doors and we all were laid off. I would probably have stayed at that place my entire career if it hadn't closed.
No_comma_ I worked at another place for a year or so_comma_ but it was terrible_comma_ so I left there and am now going to school for something better. So_comma_ it all has worked out well.
My aunt died last year and I was thinking about her yesterday.
She was like a mom to be and raised me in my younger years.
I am_comma_ it's just that the fleeting memories make me sad.
I hope.  I keep her close to by heart.
My cat is such a comfort.  He likes to sleep under the covers with me.  
Aww!  I've only the one right now_comma_ but he is the cuddliest kitty.  Demands to be under the blankets with me most nights.  
Same.  I got his out of an old detective novel.  
We do the best for them_comma_ even if it's not what we want.  
I was given a beffitting birthday by my sibblings
I was a year older_comma_lol
I lost my mom's dog yesterday and it's been about 24 hours since she went missing! I'm trying to find her but had to take a break.
Thank you so much that means a lot. I've posted on a few dog watching apps and people are supportive.
I am broke and cannot afford to pay my bills. I am afraid that I have hurt my family because of my mental issues. I am embarrassed to tell anyone. 
I don't think there is anything you can do to help. This is something_comma_ I most likely will need to resolve on my own. Unfortunately. 
My insurance will not cover this type of expenses. I am medicated_comma_ but I do not feel that it helps. 
Maybe so_comma_ I should look into that. I feel like just speaking to someone about this would help. 
I feel such love and joy towards my sister's new baby. It's overwhelming.
It's a girl. My first niece_comma_ and she's beautiful.
Unfortunately no_comma_ not yet. My wife and I are hoping to have kids someday.
Thanks! Right now I'm happy to be spoiling my new niece.
I have a 9 month old great niece_comma_ she's the sweetest thing ever.
I love being able to help take care of her.

Like a brand new person. I want to do everything I can to show him how to love a good_comma_ moral life!
We are so close and always believe in each other
Am taling about my partner
I got tickets to see Pink in concert. I can't wait_comma_ she is one of my favorite singers.
She also puts on a great show. Well worth the price of the tickets.
She had a genuine personality that made you feel comfortable almost immediately.
She became one of my closest friends and confidant.
She sadly moved far away.
My car keeps overheating and it's definitely not a good sign. I'm afraid I may have to find a new car soon.
Possibly a truck this time. I've never had the pleasure of owning one.
I had no clue what I was going to make for supper. When I got home my husband had fixed us a wonderful meal.
My favorite Enchiladas. I was caught completely off guard by this but I loved it.
everyone around me was pointing and laughing. I think I saw a couple of smartphones whip out and people taking pictures 
I slipped and fell at walmart. while wearing a skirt with no panties. 
I couldnt help myself esteem
My shoe peeld off at the middle of the road_comma_when i looked up_comma_all eyes were on me
I went to Seattle once and it is such a pretty city.  But the rain_comma_ oh the rain.  I fell right in front of this cute guy.
He didn't at all.  I felt so clumsy!  Seattle is nice_comma_ but don't go in March.
Thankfully not.  I'm told the summer is very nice.
My wife's cooking is amazing these days. She has really come a long way from when we first met.
I can only grill food on a barbecue pit. She has learned how to create new dishes I have never even thought possible.
I got so mad_comma_  when my little sister spilled oil on my white trouser 
exactly_comma_  and I was already late to work 
I love the feeling of getting home from work and having a few hours before bed to hang out and watch TV and stuff.
I think it's needed to keep our heads straight_comma_ so we don't get bogged down in the nonsense of daily life.
my husband and I have been married 28 years. I've never even looked at another man.
thank you. we've been through a lot_comma_ but I've always stuck by his side
My husband is the most trustworthy person I know and he makes me a better person.
We have been married for nearly 10 years now. It is the best decision I have ever made.
Thank you. I would do it all over again if I had the choice.
My son told me how much he loves and appreciates me. I haven't seen him around here in over 5 years.
It felt so good to see him again_comma_ it's been so long. I just hope he keeps coming around because I miss him a lot.
These days I feel so isolated and alone. My daughter moved out so it's only me these days.
Yes about once a week_comma_ sometimes more. She just went off to college so she lives out of state.
My grandmother is such a wonderful person and when I was 5 years old_comma_ she crocheted me the most beautiful pink and blue baby doll blanket. 
I do. I recently gave it to my own daughter for her to enjoy! It is so special.
I think she will. She is a special girl.
During a storm_comma_ a water main broke and flooded my entire house just a few weeks after my son was born. It destroyed a lot of our belongings and the house was ruined.
We have recovered finally. We ended up having to live in a hotel for a few weeks until we found a new place to live. Our family was very helpful.
We did so the financial aspect was not much of a hardship_comma_ but it was during Thanksgiving holiday so it made Christmas shopping difficult.
I left work early today and feel a little bad about it. I was really sick and now I know I'll have to play catch up later today when I go back.
I hope they understand but it's usually frowned upon. I just was so violently ill I couldn't be there any longer.
I accidentally sent my boss an inappropriate text last night! I'm so mortified!
No_comma_ it's not! I meant to send it to my best friend. I don't know how I'm going to face him on Monday!
My girlfriend helped me with my chores when she came to my house last weekend 
Oh yeah_comma_  she is so lovely 
My uncle tragically passed away in a car accident_comma_ leaving behind his wife and son. I desperately wanted to help them in their time of need_comma_ even if it was simply cleaning the house. They are the sweetest family.
That's awful. Life comes with so many challenges. They were the family that helped everyone around them_comma_ no matter what they needed. It felt good to be able to give back to them.
That is wonderful that you have been able to turn a tragedy into an opportunity to empathize with others facing the same difficulties. 
Not many people reciprocate the efforts of others and I commend you for considering your own suffering and using it to better others.
Through our family's tragedy_comma_ we learned that there is a larger connection between people.  Our church family was huge is supporting us.
That is great.  I don't think that I would have done very well without our church family.  We felt loved the entire battle.
I was really scared about the possibility of losing my cat to a bad illness_comma_ but I was lucky that the vet worked hard to find out what was wrong.
Yes_comma_ I was petrified at first because it looked dire! The vet knew how badly I wanted help for my cat_comma_ so thank heavens she cared to get an answer!
I recently had plans with my boyfriend_comma_ but one of my good friends is going through a really hard time_comma_ so I canceled with him to go hang out with her instead. I think she was really appreciative of it. 
Thanks_comma_ I appreciate that. I know she would do the same for me_comma_ so I'm happy to be there for her. 
Hi! I just found out that my daughter is moving to another state.
She got a good job so I am happy for her.  But I can't imagine not being able to see her every day.  Do you get to talk to yours often?
With FaceTime I guess it won't be so bad.
lol -- I FaceTime with my 10 year who is upstairs in his bedroom!
I am so thankful for all the help I received after my mom passed away. I was able to overcome my grief thanks to all my friends and family :) 
Yeah_comma_ they have been so supportive these last few years. I really love them and am so grateful to have them! 
My oldest friends live in San Francisco and I haven't had a chance to visit in four years.
Money_comma_ I just finished grad school last year and found a full time job.  Now I have a bit of vacation and I'm very excited to start planning the trip!
My house is perfect for my family. Just big enough for everyone. I love it.
How exciting! I love being a homeowner!
My shorts fell down one time in gym class.
I don't think so_comma_ I tried to pull them up as fast as possible.
I had to have my tonsils removed last year. The surgeon was reassuring when I was worried_comma_ which was very helpful.
Yes_comma_ I agree.  But you just feel like you have had a great sleep!
I think the movie would have been fun_comma_ but I felt much better honoring my prior commitment and being faithful to that friend.
I think so and my friend really appreciated it.
I filled out all of my "new patient" paper work before my appointment with my new doctor.
Not too long_comma_ maybe 15 minutes?  The nurses commented that they were really happy they didn't have to wait on me to do it in the office lol
I work in a building that has parts of it under construction and our senior staff is offering tours. I'm a little worried about tripping and falling on something if I take a tour through the live construction zone. 
I agree! I think if I do it_comma_ i need to buy some closed-toe shoes and make sure I'm wearing the correct clothing. 
It is hard to make a decision to take a new job when you have been with one employer for a long time.
Yes_comma_ I feel like I need new experiences but I feel a sense of loyalty to my current employer.
I agree_comma_ I want to keep growing in my career.
Thank you_comma_ I appreciate it!
Looking to get this new job in my area.

How can a mother do that to a child?
I"I was told from a little girl that my greatgrand parents farm would one day come to me. I believed it all my life and never questioned it. Momma sold it out from under me 2 months ago.".
No but my heart was in that farm. I had to sell my cows and I had bottle raised them all and had had them for 6 years.
I'm installing a new dishwasher in my kitchen today!
I'm doing it myself! I've never done it_comma_ but I watched a bunch of YouTube videos_comma_ so I feel like I'm ready to tackle this job!
I have been feeling a little lonely lately 
That sounds like a great idea! I would love to just dance and shake off all these bad vibes! :) 
Hello!  I was really worried about my son the other day.
He came home from school and said it was a bad day.  He seemed very down.
It did.  I made him his favorite dinner and we talked about how some days will just be worse than others.
When we were trying to buy our first home_comma_ our financing fell through.
It was a couple weeks out.  We had to switch lenders and it took another six months to find a place.
I am very sad_comma_ my mother recently passed away from a heart attack
Yeah_comma_ I am very lucky to a have a great boyfriend_comma_ has has been very supportive and is helping me pull myself together. 
Yesterday_comma_ I walked around with makeup smeared all over my face. I wish someone had told me.
Did anyone tell you? I completely forgot I even had it on until I got home.
My son was potty training when he was 2 and he ran out at a party without his pants on! My jaw dropped and I couldn't hide my red face!
No_comma_ they were a bunch of single people that my husband works with. They all laughed about it_comma_ but I was humiliated. It is funny to think back on now.
Yes_comma_ he is older now and would never do that. He is such a funny kid though. I was glad when that phase passed!
Hey there_comma_ I had an embarrassing situation today..
I was at the grocery store when I noticed my fly was undone!
It wasn't easy recently when I told a friend I needed to stay home from going out for food and some entertainment because it wasn't something I could afford.
I do_comma_ too! Though_comma_ when you are caretaking for a parent_comma_ I realize it will be a very long time before that happens.
I was rather nervous the other night when I was waiting to sing at a concert.
Well people said they liked it_comma_ so I was glad_comma_ but I don't really think I sing that great.
Thanks! It's not something I do very often so yeah_comma_ I was quite anxious about it.
Oh yeah_comma_ I got through it_comma_ which is the main thing!
A few months ago I found some old family pictures. It made me miss old times
They were. It made me miss all my cousins and Aunts and Uncles who've passed. 
I'm so mad at my neighbor! He's working on his home and dropped nails in the street.
Not really_comma_ but I was so annoyed when I came out this morning to a flat tire on my car.
Last year my grandmother passed away. It's still hard to cope with
It is. I still can't look at old pictures of her. 
I'm sorry. Thanks_comma_ That's really nice.
My husband convinced me that it was a good move.
Changing jobs after 16 years at one place.
We were under new managment and the new supervisor was mean to everyone. I didn't even want to go there on a daily basis.
I went out for dinner the other night and it was at a really fancy restaurant.  I knocked my drink over by accident.
It was a full glass_comma_ and it spilled all over the table.
I was trying to get to a loaf of bread in the fridge_comma_ and I knocked over a full tub of my mother in law's chicken corn chowder!
Yeah but now the kitchen smells like milky soup! My mother in law is going to be a little peeved too_comma_ oops.
Yeah but you'd never know for sure haha!
When I was a teenager I went tandem skydiving. This involved a total stranger being strapped to my back and jumping out of a plane. Thinking back on it now_comma_ I had to put a lot of trust that that dude wasn't a psycho murderer.
Haha yea it does now. Back then it seemed so reasonable.
"I promised to visit a friend in prison every week. I enjoyed each time
They were at the wrong place at the wrong time unfortunately. 
Every time I visit I think it brightens their day and gives them hope.
I just moved into a new place and I'm still waiting on a deposit from my old place. It's not looking good.
Not at all. I was very diligent about cleaning everything up.
Yeah but it's taken quite a bit of time and I'm sweating up a storm over here.
My girlfriend had her galbladder taken out. she was in the hospital for 3 days 
She is I was worried though and could not bring myself to leave the hospital
When I was pregnant_comma_ the smell of cooking egss made me feel so sick
I tried_comma_ but once I had to go to a brunch work thing for my husband's job.  I spent the whole time in the restroom.
I was so nervous to ride that roller coaster_comma_ but my sister was begging me to go.
I did_comma_ and it was scary! But I had a good time!
I'm a teacher_comma_ one of my students was in a house fire.
No one got hurt.  But he lost his house and all of his belongings.  It was awful.
I was watching an old VHS tape of my family and I out at the beach. It's crazy to think how time has flown by so fast.
It did. Life is good these days_comma_ but full of so many worries and stress. Sometimes I wish I could just go back to making dinky little sand castles.
That's awesome. Hold onto this stuff for as long as you can!
Don't you hate when you try and help someone with something and then you mess it up? I was trying to ease the burden of housework for my husband this weekend and it didn't go well.
I was trying to unclog our sink_comma_ got it all taken apart_comma_ and then was unable to put it back together again. I had to have him do it when he got home_comma_ so it wasn't much help in the end.
I'm a teacher_comma_ start back at work in just 2 weeks.
I did.  I'm really looking forward to meeting my new class for the first time.
Last week someone approached me and tried to get information about a close friends business.
I told them I couldn't help them_comma_ they're in management with a competitors company.
Yes_comma_ I believe they're trying to undercut my friend on a big contract.
I've had this dirtbike since I was a kid_comma_ and took all kinds of care of it. My neighbor backed over it on accident.
It's completely mangled. I'm going to try myself_comma_ but it doesn't look good. So many years on that thing down the drain.
Yeah I'll have to hold onto them as tight as I can.
I'm a teacher. and school starts back up in just 2 weeks.
I had a great summer.  I'm feeling really good about this coming year.  Teaching the same grade for the third time.
I went my wife's job recently_comma_ and while I was waiting for her in the reception area_comma_ one of her coworkers was hitting on me. I politely declined their advances_comma_ and asked to be left alone while I waited for my wife.
She did_comma_ I had met her a few times before_comma_ but I hadn't spoken more than few words to her.
My daughter is a sophomore in college and spent the summer with her boyfriend.
I have met him once. He seems like a nice guy. 
I had the best weekend! My husband brought a puppy home and seeing him with our son for the first time was so cute!
He is an 8 week old Cane Corso. My son has had such a great time learning how to play with him and teach him things.
When I was about seven years old_comma_ my cat Hector got out of the house and got lost in the neighborhood.
Unfortunately we weren't. We put out signs but never were able to track him down.
I'm a teacher_comma_ and am back at school in just 2 weeks.
I've already done a lot of my planning.  Helps when I've taught the same grade twice before.
My wife just got over being sick. It was a weird summer flu. It could've been worse
Yeah I got to spend a lot of time with her helping her out. It felt great doing that for her.
She felt spoiled that's for sure haha!
A friend of mine just won  a lot of money off of a lottery ticket.
$10_comma_000.  I feel happy for her_comma_ but still wish it had been me instead.
Summer is drawing down and I'm ready to just kick back for a little bit. This is usually the busy time of year for me.
I'm sorry to hear that. When I get the next chance to kick back_comma_ I'll kick back extra hard for you haha.
I will when the coast is clear_comma_ thank you!
When I was really young my parents decided to finish the basement of their house and make it into a master suite. I thought that would be cool_comma_ but I was so freaked out for many months after!
I was just scared because my parents and I had always been in rooms next to each other and now they were ALL the way downstairs. Thinking back it was a pretty silly thing to be afraid about.
On Saturday_comma_ I was able to go to the park and enjoy nature.
Yes. I usually have so many things to do. And this day_comma_ I could enjoy it.
My husband got a raise at work this week! I was so impressed with him. 
He has. His work place has really started to recognize all the hard work he does around there which makes me so proud of him.
I watched a movie the other night with my kids_comma_ they really enjoyed it and we had a lot of cute conversation about it.
It's called Ponyo. They've been singing a song from it for the last couple of days.
I recently had to go interview for a job I knew I was under qualified for_comma_ so I was fairly nervous going in.
The interview went pretty well_comma_ and I did end up getting the job_comma_ but I'm gonna have a lot of on the job training to do.
The other day I was looking through some old photo albums.
It brought back lots of good memories :)
When I was younger_comma_ in a lapse of judgement_comma_ I stole chocolate bars from a shop I used to work in. I was caught. I felt terrible. It wasn't like me at all. I wish I could undo my actions.
That's true. I wasn't really a child though! I was at university! We all have little devils inside us_comma_ I suppose.
Thank you_comma_ that means a lot.
My mom sent me a package the other day that had a bunch of my old comics in it the other day. It was a real trip to go through them all_comma_ it brought back a lot of memories.
A lot of them were still pretty good_comma_ but I think my fondness for them largely hinges on my memories of reading them as a kid.
My son's pediatrician told me to call Early Intervention because he's delayed in talking.
Not at all.  I'm hoping he'll catch up soon.  The appointment is set for next week and I'm pretty nervous.
My toddler son has been so exhausting lately. Luckily_comma_ his grandparents were able to take him for an overnight the other night which was a nice break.
Yeah I have a 9 month old as well and I never would have thought that the baby would be the easy one! I'm so thankful I live close enough to family that they can watch them from time to time.
I found out that a friend of mine from high school passed away recently.
Yeah_comma_ I'm doing okay. It hit pretty hard because we were pretty close back then_comma_ but had drifted apart the last few years. I wish I hadd taken the time to do more with him.
I heard on the radio that Beyonce will be performing in my city soon.
Yes I have enjoyed her music over the years and I like to attend her concerts as well when I can.
A friend of mine had an pretty serious illness and had to be in the hospital for quite a while. I spent as much time as I could there with him to keep his spirits up.
We've been close for a long time_comma_ so it was the least I could do for him. I know he'd do the same for me.
I have never been an athletic person_comma_ but my parents insisted that I participate in a sport_comma_ so I chose softball. I was so excited when I heard the crack of the bat as I hit the ball. It was such a satisfying moment.
I never became the best player on the field by any means_comma_ but it was so nice to not fail completely. We just bought a pool because my children love swimming!
That's very true and I think it was the mental aspect that was the most encouraging for me. I was driven to succeed and I did it! It was very empowering.
My daughter starts playing softball this year.  I tried playing when I was younger_comma_ but the other girls were mean
She's extremely excited about it_comma_ but I can't help but be a little bit scared for her after my experience.
I've been pet sitting for my mom the last couple weeks_comma_ and my wife decided to come spend the weekend with me last week. It was really nice just to have her with me.
It is_comma_ and it has been nice for both of us to have some time to relax on our own_comma_ but it was really great to spend time with her after being seperate for so long.
When we were kids_comma_ my older sister pretended to abandon me at the mall because I was being a brat.
Yeah_comma_ I definitely deserved it LOL.  I never acted like that again with her!
I was walking to a restaurant to meet with some friends_comma_ and on my way there I tripped over a tree branch in front of a bunch of people and looked like a total idiot.
Only my pride_comma_ I fell right on my backside and made a ridiculous noise.
Yeah_comma_ I'm sure it was pretty funny to watch_comma_ and thinking back on it's more amusing then embarrassing.
I always think I want some "me" time_comma_ but this weekend my husband and our toddler son were both gone and I actually kind of felt bored and sad!
Exactly. We have an infant daughter_comma_ but she goes to bed so early that I had a lot of hours of doing nothing in particular. 
Going out to run errands for the first time after having a baby was scary. I was so afraid I would forget something I needed. I was so relieved when we returned home and everything went perfectly smooth.
It was overwhelming_comma_ but we made it without too much stress.
I was so scared to skydive_comma_ but my instructor was great and I was finally able to jump.
I think so! If someone I knew really wanted to go.
I don't have belief in myself_comma_ I have belief in God. I know that what I can't do_comma_ God can do.
I also need to reduce my pride. I am too prideful to ask for help in a lot of situations_comma_ because I always think I can do it myself.
A game I'm really looking forward to is coming out this October_comma_ and I'm super pumped to play it.
Red Dead Redemption 2. The first one is one of my favorite games of all time_comma_ so I can't wait to play the sequel.
Verizon sent me a damaged iphone and I returned it. Now they're claiming they never received it! I got charged over 500 dollars for it.
I was at first_comma_ but I think it was hellish mix up. I'm working it out with them now_comma_ hopefully they don't nab with that money.
I agree haha! Do they need another 500 dollars? Not mine for sure.
My mom made a cake for my brother's birthday so I can't touch it until he eats first.
Pretty hungry_comma_ but the cake looks so good so I want even more. Strawberry shortcake style.
My grandmother passed away 20 years ago.  I just found a quilt she made me when I was a baby
It has holes all in it_comma_ but I just can't let it go!  It means too much to me.
I'm incredibly upset.  I just found out my husband has been cheating on me last week.
We talked long enough for me to tell him it's over.  We can't come back from this_comma_ no matter how difficult it will be for me.
I hate to bring this up because of how it makes me look. I just found out my parents have been paying my sister's mortgage. Great for her but I get nothing in my times of need.
Yeah totally. I've learned through the years to be almost completely self sufficient. I am happy for my sister but I wonder where I fit in the mix sometimes.
I certainly hear about it a lot! haha
I was challenged to a 2 on 2 pool game with my partner being my friend Joe.
I did alright_comma_ but Joe carried the team and I expected him to due to his pool skills.
A friend of mine recently had their bathroom remodeled_comma_ and it made me feel like mine looks terrible by comparison.
Yeah_comma_ I just moved into my place last year_comma_ and the bathroom is quite outdated. After seeing his though_comma_ remodeling it has moved way up my list of things to get done.
I just can't stand it when people make uninformed remarks about a subject. My mom irritated me so bad by doing that the other day.
Agreed! My husband and I did a ton of research on a new puppy we were getting and she still found the worst article she could to act like she knew more than us. 
We had to make a BIG move from Hawaii to Nashville when my husband lost a job. We didn't know anybody here but we just had to believe it would turn out okay...
It's been almost 3 years and it's been ups and downs. We like it here_comma_ but we miss Hawaii like crazy!
It seems funny to me how all my hometown friends are all moving away
I've always been content to just stay here. I guess for some people_comma_ adventure is nice_comma_ but for others there's no place quite like home!
It's nice to be where you know everyone!
My Ac went out a month ago. I knew it was gonna be during the summer.
Not yet_comma_ I'm working on it because it apparently has to be replaced. I did buy multiple floor fans though.
A friend of mine challenged me and said I couldn't eat an entire bag of jelly beans. I'm super competitive and had to prove her wrong. 
I had such a sugar rush and then crashed hard after hah! I felt like I had to brush my teeth for an hour that night.
So my neighbor who is elderly has an above ground swimming pool. It's tilting because it wasn't put together properly. It was getting very unsafe
Yes indeed. I stepped in to help not really knowing what  I was doing. I screwed up at first a bunch but after all day working on it_comma_ I got it fixed!
Yeah I just didn't want her or her grandkids to hurt themselves. The pool is very important to them.
A few months before having my first kiddo_comma_ we decided to buy a car. It did very well during the initial inspection_comma_ but within a month_comma_ it needed several thousand dollars in repairs!
Absolutely. The problems should have been easily located by a mechanic. It was so hard and I was livid. We sold the car because we were so frustrated with it.
It does_comma_ but we got such a good deal on the car that we made a couple of the repairs and were able to recuperate our cost.
My son is 3 and we've been working on his ABCs lately. 
Well I didn't think he was really grasping it_comma_ but last night I heard him singing a song and it was all his ABCs!
My youngest sister is about to start her senior year of high school.  I'm so proud of everything she has accomplished.
Yeah_comma_ she's adopted and has been with the family for 14 years now.  I always try and help her study when I get the chance_comma_ and I'm excited for this new stage of her life.
I am an avid book collector and reader. I recently unpacked all my books and it took me so long!
I was super shocked to find out that I have over 300 so far!
My husband and I renewed out wedding vows for our 25th anniversary. It was such a sweet and memory filled day. 
Thank you. No_comma_ my grown children were there. They made a slide show of hubby and I over the years. Brought tears to my eyes. 
Nothing really quite compares to the feeling you get when something exciting is about to happen. I still remember how I felt the days leading up to my wedding.
I was definitely jittery but mostly excited. We'd been engaged for a year and a half and I was ready for the day!
This is going to make me sound like a chicken_comma_ but I've got a neighbor whos twice my size and a little bit of a rage case. His fence is falling over into my yard.
I've been going back and forth in my head all day getting ready for this. I'm ready to be firm on it that's for sure. And yes_comma_ he will be livid that I'm even looking at him!
Thank you so much_comma_ I hope for the best haha.
The first time I met my husband I made an absolute fool of myself. I drank way too much.
Haha! Very true_comma_ although I don't drink much at all now. He must have seen something he liked about me. I_comma_ on the other hand_comma_ felt horrible about it.
I had a party last weekend_comma_ and I got everything ready a week in advance so it would go well.
It went very well_comma_ my guests all seemed to have a good time_comma_ and we didn't run out of booze or food the wole night!
I just found out I didn't get into the college I wanted to. I'm really disappointed and feel like I should give up
I'm trying to see that side of it_comma_ but it's the only school I wanted to go to
I needed to get rid of some things_comma_ so I made a Craigslist post to come to my house and take them.
I did_comma_ and luckily the people were honest and didn't take anything else
My mom sent my a bunch of stuff from my childhood the other day. It was really nice to see a lot of it.
It was mostly old comics and toys she had had in her attic for years. She just wanted to clear out some space_comma_ and I was happy to take them off her hands.
I grew up in Japan and for some reason my brother and I liked older music. Especially the Beatles. When I hear their songs_comma_ I think of him...
Yes_comma_ there were just two kids in the family. He's still in Japan and I'm in Nashville_comma_ so we don't see each other much at all.
I was at the store last week and slipped on some water on the floor I didn't see. I broke my leg! I was mortified! 
Yes_comma_ I will need to wear the cast for at least another 5 weeks. People are so rude too. They all just stood there and laughed at me!
I've been flipping through some old photo albums and it chokes me up thinking about simpler times.
Yeah_comma_ I pay so much attention to these photos_comma_ and they evoke all these memories. It brings me down but I guess I just have to keep paying as much attention as possible to those good times.
That's true. It takes so much time waiting around for those times to come back_comma_ but they won't but they do live on.
My friend had to have a mole biopsied and check for cancer_comma_ and they were quite worried about it. Luckily_comma_ we found out the other day that it is noncancerous and just needs to be remmoved.
Absolutely_comma_ he was pretty scared. I'm just glad it wasn't cancer.
I was walking around with my brother on a Sunday_comma_ and I got into a pointless argument with him. I am disappointed that I left myself get caught up in it.
Yes we talked it over and thought about all the good times we have when we get along!
I took my daughter to see a circus show at Circus Circus in Reno_comma_ and that look on her face was priceless.
I'd like to think that I had that same look when I went there at her age.
Some of them_comma_ until she won a stuffed cheeseburger and wouldn't let go of it.
My one year old just learned how to take off her diaper and she smeared poop all over my leg the other day.
It was so gross! She had been eating a chocolate granola bar so I thought it was just chocolate. It is funny now_comma_ but I was mortified then!
You and me both!
I am about to become a grandma for the third time. My daughter has two boys already and I'm thinking pink...
Thank you! I would love either_comma_ but I can't help hoping for a girl to dress up...
My mother-law-donated a kidney to her cousin_comma_ who was sick.
Both patients are doing great_comma_ thank goodness!  We were so worried.
I've entered an upcoming endurance competition like a tough mudder. I've been going at it for months and I believe I am hyperFOCUSED.
There is no time to rest_comma_ in fact if I do_comma_ I might be waiting 3-4 minutes for a very short response.
i felt trusting when my dad and my mon care for me
yes and our parents love us . always can happen whatever thing always they say love you
I can't wait! We just bought a car today! Going to pick it up soon! 
A 2018 Ford Fusion! It's the first brand new car we've evered owned! 
I was stuck on the side of the road when I saw a police officer ride by he slowed down and came back to help me
yes me too at 5:00 in the country halfway between work and home
thats true got me to work on time
I found out the other day that I didn't get ther job I interviewed for.
I did_comma_ I ended up getting another job I wanted_comma_ but I was pretty bummed about losing the other one. The commute would have been much nicer.
I've been laid up all day with an illness so it's good to be talking to someone.
I'm getting there_comma_ feeling better now than early this morning. Thanks for the contact though I'm certainly a social animal.
See I'm feeling great right now! It worked haha!
Whenever I need to travel and cannot take my kids_comma_ I know that I can leave them with my parents and not have to worry at all about their safety and security. 
It is wonderful. I'm not sure I trust anyone as much as my own parents with my kiddos. My parents treat my kids better than they treated me!
I agree. I have used daycare and such_comma_ but there are always problems there. I know my parents will always be alert and keep them safe_comma_ and not just for a paycheck. 
Thanks! I am totally glad you can relate!
My dad gave my son a very special model car and within the week_comma_ it was broken.
He didn't understand_comma_ so he wasn't in trouble_comma_ but I have to admit I was a little sad about it.
Yes_comma_ it was and my dad acted like it was no big deal and just gave him a hug so it was a good lesson in forgiveness.
My friend moved for a new job recently and she just took her two dogs to a shelter. She didn't even try to find them homes.
I know_comma_ if she couldn't keep them_comma_ then at least she could try to find someone to take them in. So sad.
I recently got a promotion. It's quite a big step up from my current role_comma_ so I'm very nervous that I won't do well in it. 
I hope so_comma_ everyone tells me I'll do great_comma_ but I still have some reservations about it. It's way different than what I do now. I've not been sleeping well. 
My partner and I both work 24 hour shifts on alternate days_comma_ too. 
I wish! We are both Paramedic/Firefighters. 
Ahh! We both enjoy it. Thanks for the thank you_comma_ though! :) 
I've been struggling all day. I had some carryout over the weekend and it's hitting me in the worse way. Very ill.
I was feeling worse earlier_comma_ with a lot of food poisoning like symptoms. I'm just now getting over the nausea. Sorry to gross you out.
Wow I didn't think of zofran. Thanks for the advice!
A while back I moved from Chicago to Dallas_comma_ I was pretty sad to leave. It was my hometown!
Yes both are big cities! However Chicago feels less crowded honestly_comma_ the metroplex there is more spread out.
A tree fell on my house_comma_ shattering my vinyl fence as my kids and I were walking passed it through the garage.
No_comma_ but everyone was quite frightened.
I was babysitting for someone I really didn't know. When they brought in the car seat_comma_ cockroaches crawled out of it. It was so gross!!
Me_comma_ too! I felt like they were all over me! I can't imagine the house they live in...
Woof I am having a hard time as of late. I've been waiting on an acceptance into a video production program and it's driving me up the wall.
It is. A lot of self doubt has crept into my head as of late and I'm trying to fight it off.
I am trying. Thanks for the boost!
My daughter picked a new flavor of ice cream and my friend and I ate it before she even got a bite.
I felt so bad that I made my husband go buy her more before she found out!
I worked in a nursing home while I was in nursing school. I have since gone back to the home to visit my old patients to check in on them.
It is!  I miss seeing them daily.  I like going to see that they're doing okay
About two weeks ago on the way to work_comma_ i managed to leave my wallet and keys on the bus! 
Luckily they were handed in by the end of the day_comma_ but it nearly gave me a heart attack! Have you ever been in the same situation?
Wow_comma_ you are so lucky it was handed back it! It gives you such a fright when it happens.
I've been training my cats to use the toilet. At first they were and everyone was super impressed_comma_ but now they've forsaken the toilet AND litter box entirely.
I've been consulting the old youtube for sure_comma_ but I think these guys are just rebelling.
And a new carpet too haha!
Recently_comma_ my dog died. It was so heartbreaking. We had him since 2010.
 He was a loving dog. Probably! I would love to get a Labrador Retriever. 
My girlfriend and I are finally in a place where we can just be together without even speaking. Sometimes it's nice to just be in the same room
I really enjoy being in a place where we aren't trying to impress each other anymore
My husband had a job interview a few days ago...now we are waiting...
Me_comma_ too! The anticipation is killing me!!!
We used some of the money we'd set aside for our son's college fund to fix our hot water heater.
Yes_comma_ these are the times I miss renting so much!  We're trying to repay what we used monthly til it's replenished.
He's 16 months old_comma_ but we knew we'd have to start saving really early because we don't have much to put away haha
I work from home now_comma_ but the last few years_comma_ I worked at a daycare.  It doesn't seem like much but my kids went for free and I loved everyone there! I should have quit so many times but I stayed
I like it okay.  I still miss it though.  Even after Hurricane Harvey and my work building flooded_comma_ I drove an extra 40 minutes to get there.  But I had a baby recently and it jsut makes sense to be at home now.  
we did and i miss the kiddos!  My kids miss it too.  But its for the best!
I will never forget when my daughter was born and they gave her to me for the first time!
I have 3 little ones too! I had a girl_comma_ then boy_comma_ then girl! Such a precious moment!
I'm debating on another too. My youngest is only 17 months so I am definitely not in a rush.
It's definitely scary to start all over again!
A couple weeks ago I help a door open for an elderly couple. I really think it's important for youth to care for the elderly!
I think so! It's like caring for your grandparents.
I am waiting to hear back about a story I submitted to a publisher. 
A true story about a Christmas miracle. I hope they publish it!
I've had a couple of stories published in anthologies and Ive done guest blogging.
I was only asleep for an hour last night and I jumped out of bed! There was this smacking noise on my window it freaked me out!
You'll never guess haha! It was just a twig. The age old branch slapping on the window in the wind.
It certainly was and I certainly looked foolish!
I moved to Texas_comma_ but it wasn't my first choice. I am living with it though!
No_comma_ just with the family! I prefer cold-weather places.
For the time being! I'm hoping to move to New York! If not_comma_ I will enjoy the winter we do get here!
I was home by myself when the power went out and I heard a strange noise!
No. I was too scared to look so I looked myself in my bedroom.
I had to give a speech to over 300 people in front of my church.
I was so nervous! I get very shy around crowds!
I thought I would pass out from the stress. I was so glad when it was over.
A buddy of mine is borrowing my car for a couple days. I figured it'd be nice to help him out but he has had a couple accidents under his belt.
Me too. It's been awhile since those accidents happened so it should be fine. I just wanted to be a good friend.
I went for a run the other day and a dog chased me while I was pushing my baby in the stroller!
It was terrifying! I was so mad. The owner was nowhere to be found.
I haven't taken her with me on a run since then.
My nephew was racing around our house_comma_ like he has a million times before_comma_ and someone took a bad fall into the corner of a bookcase.  I had to take him to the ER.
Yes_comma_ luckily it looked much worse than it actually was!
My son went off to college. I found a baby picture of him and it made me sad.
I guess I need to find a hobby to keep me busy!
I had entered what seemed like a fake contest a little while ago_comma_ but today I just got an air fryer in the mail! I think it was from that contest.
It certainly is true. I had no idea what was in the box on my doorstep_comma_ but lo and behold a smallish air fryer! I can't wait to fry smallish chickens haha.
I'll make some room!
I have spent the last two months looking after my grandfather whilst my grandmother has been in hospital_comma_ have you ever been in such a situation?
I dont have them myself_comma_ just grandparents! I also wish to have grandchildern one day though
I had an interview and I forgot a portion of what I was saying. It was a little awkward.
Yes! I think I recovered okay. I just moved on to my next statement. It's a bummer freezing up though!
My gas gauge broke in my car over the weekend. Although I had filled it up with gas_comma_ I remained adamant it had gas in it
I did ! I brought it to the auto parts place over the weekend. They blamed it on a loose wire. Imagine that lol
I just got married to a wonderful woman. She's been working so hard to get to where she is nowadays. She's become a very successful clinical psychologist.
Yeah but it would be a tad unethical to get service from her_comma_ but I assure you she's a good one.
Thank you so much that is so kind of you to say.
I had to ask my teacher if she would mind going over a assinment again with mme
Yeah it was good for me but i was nervous to ask
because i was nervous about it
My friends invited me to a party that involved alcohol and drugs. I decided to not drink or anything because I am a Christian.
Yeah_comma_ you don't want to pass out or start hallucinating aliens. That would be very scary.
That's very true. I am glad that I'm still alive today.
One time when I was in middle school_comma_ my friend was making fun of me. So_comma_ I pulled his pants down.
Actually_comma_ he stopped making fun of me because he was an alien.
When I moved to a new town_comma_ it was hard to make new friends?
Yes_comma_ they are all old.
I loaned a friend a good amount of money that I knew he would pay back right away.
I did_comma_ he even gave me an extra $100 to make up for having to ask me in the first place!
My brothers wife left him and took off with the baby.
He is. Its hard on all of us. 
I took in a small kitten I found and have been nursing her back to health
I think so im kinda attached at this point
My husband took our infant out into the world by himself today. There are so many things that could go wrong
You have to have faith that they can handle any situation. Thankfully_comma_ he did well
Yes_comma_ we always have to trust them!
Someone was broke done right down the street from my house. They noticed my husbands tools in our carport and asked to borrow a $230 tool. I let them and had to trust they would bring it back.
Yes they returned it back in the same shape it left. It was a family and the dad was working on the car. I felt bad because I know how bad it is to be broke down with kids in the car.
I hope so! That would make me feel good.
"I have given someone I did not know who was done on their luck some money for food
Yes_comma_ they were grateful_comma_ saying how nice and blessed they felt. Some people would think people like that would take the money and run. I do not think that way.
Being a married female in a male-dominated work environment can sometimes cause it's insecurities in the other partner. 
Oh absolutely! Thankfully_comma_ I haven't had any issues. 
My high school friend hit my car.
Yes it was 100% her fault. They hit my car that she let me park in her driveway! She should have been more careful.
I was going through some trouble in the past couple years financially and mentally. I'm in a good spot now though thanks to my family and friends.
Thanks to the connections through my friends I was able to get a decent enough job and find a good place to live on my own. They really pulled through for me.
Yeah thank you! It's never a bad thing to accept a helping hand from a good friend.
I am so excited for week 1 of the NFL season! Football is my favorite sport.
My favorite team is the Chicago Bears! Haha_comma_ I don't have high expectations though. How about you?
Today I visited a campus where I used to work_comma_ it was good to be there and I kind of missed the old times!
Yes
Yes_comma_ I could_comma_ but it's not quite the same when you don't actually work there any more.
Thank you very much!
I ate at a Korean restaurant for my birthday and the food was delicious.
I love Korean barbeque_comma_ specifically grilled beef with rice. You should definitely try it!

I won $400 in a raffle!
It was for employees at my work. Just something special they do when we do a good job.
My first baby just turned 11 yesterday. I can't believe she is a pre-teen now. I feel like she was just a baby not too long ago.
Yes! She cares about her appearence more than ever and wants to shave her legs. She also has more of an attitude. Sometmes it's intentional and sometimes its not.
Thanks! I try to be.
I am thinking of getting this polaris slingshot I have been wanting. Hence the Mturking. I'm not sure if I will be able to afford it though
maybe I could get the 2035 year model haha
That's true! I wish I could find something else that pays better. 
Within limits yes I agree!
Went camping with my husband and he forgot to grab his overnight bag. Luckily_comma_ I had a list and made sure to grab it for him.

i cleaned my parents attic and found all my old kids toys!
Maybe im just excited to share them with my kids
E must have been off his meds or something
I asked him for his insurance card
The movie Clueless was a big part of my teenage years. I got to watch it with my niece last week!
It made me remember how hard the teenage years are for everyone. It was fun though!

yeah it happens but it doesnt feel good
I feel at peace when my best friend_comma_ my dog_comma_ is near me

it is Neuro Science_comma_ and im sure I will im just packing it in
 My neighbor just purchased a new truck while i'm still riding around in my 2005 Honda Accord !
That is true.  Mine does not always work well. I would enjoy his comfortable seats and being able to make phone calls through the voice in my car stereo
I won $25 on a lottery ticket and when I went out to cash it_comma_ I lost it! I tried to find it but it was gone. 
Me too. I was going to put that $25 in my gas tank. 
lately it has been tough for me to put aside money to pay tithing to my church_comma_ but i have been able to keep up with it still.
no_comma_ but i think twice about spending money on things i really dont need like candy or alcohol_comma_ both of which i feel i should abstain from regardless of finances!
thanks me too! i really feel like things in my life fall into place when i keep paying my tithes
that was real nice of you to let your sister's friend borrow money from you.
hi! sorry. i was saying that my sister has a friend that needed some money and i had it to lend_comma_ there fore i let her borrow the money..
yes_comma_ i try to put others before me sometimes.
I was talking with one of my coworkers yesterday and told them a secret.
No_comma_ they actually didn't tell it.
Hello!  I decided to try and make dinner from a new recipe.
Chicken Alfredo Broccoli Mushroom Bake. I improvised a bit.
I cook a variety of dishes.  And I used my secret Alfredo recipe for the sauce_comma_ so I am happy with the way it turned out.
Next time we have a Hurricane pass this way_comma_ I'll certainly be ready ...
In MIssissippi here. Katrina wiped us out. I moved further north to avoid the coastal surges.
I had to take my driver licence test agian to get them back.
Well I studied for 4 nights in a row_comma_ so you can imagine how i didn't feel nervous test day.
 can vividly remember the first time my dad took the training wheels off of my bicycle
Oh yes ! I fell and scraped my knees_comma_ let our a very LOUD yell_comma_ and instantly called for my MOTHER !
I didnt know how I was going to pay my car insurance last month. If it got canceled_comma_ I wouldnt be able to drive to work!
Oh no. If you get caught here_comma_ its a $500 fine!
I made it happen!
There was this kitten that was poking around my house_comma_ and I felt bad for it because it was very hot outside.
Nope_comma_ it was all alone.  A neighbor eventually brought it inside_comma_ but unfortunately_comma_ he didn't know how to care for cats.
He called me_comma_ but it was already too late for the kitten.
im waiting for a test work to come back and im kinda sweating it
it is blood work. very serious blood work
I went to a rural school out in the middle of nowhere. I had to transfer due to how overwhelmingly exclusive it was.
I got to the original school on scholarships and ended up having to get FAFSA to transfer. I just finished paying it off but the transfer was well worth it.
Me too. The original school was more cows than people.
Last night I was going through my son's memory box and I found his report card from 4th grade. He was always in some kind of mischief. Always makes me smile to read these memories.
He just started 6th grade! I can only imagine what the year will bring. That's a tough transition.
Very much! Let's hope we both survive the year!
I was at my sons school for an event. A child threw up right in front of me.
It was. I couldn't get out of there fast enough!
im so upset my neighbors do not clean up after there dogs

have you ever cheated on a diet?
well for the past week ive been on a diet and i havent cheated.. so proud of myself. 
yeah_comma_ it was hard but i made it. but now i want a cookie.. the temptation is hard. 
As a kid i was afraid to sleep in my room because of my closet
I thought we had a ghost for a long time
I just got older and was no longer afraid
I haven't been getting much sleep lately. Part of my rent on a farm property I live on is making sure hunters don't sneak onto the property. They always sneak in at the worst times.
Yeah those help me a lot as far as getting to them early_comma_ but they are just constantly at it! It's not even hunting season.
Trust me the police are involved. They hate coming out because it's always the same thing. Sometimes the same guys too.
I always like making sure I am ready for anything! I always pack a ton of food when I am on long car rides. 
Me too!! I also started wearing disposable underwear so I don't have to make any pit stops. I love being ready for anything. 
In JR High_comma_ there was this kid who was always throwing apples at birds in the air.
Because he was a rich jerk.  A teacher caught him after he hit a bird once_comma_ and then we took care of the bird until it's broken wing was better.
I went to the grocery store last week_comma_ which is 30 miles away from my house_comma_ and when I got home_comma_ I discovered I was overcharged by $20. That made me mad! 
Yes_comma_ I did. But now I have to wait until next month to get my money_comma_ as I only go there once a month. Grrrrrr...
I forgot my brothers birthday and I tried to cover it up but he knew. I called him the next day but it wasn't the same.
Yes. But he brings it up when he wants to mess with me.
Older. Brothers and sisters mess with each other. Its just a thing.
So  last Halloween i ate all my kids candy while they were asleep
yeah and i was worried so i went out that morning and bought them more candy to replace it
Right now I have my cat next to me_comma_ Infinity War on TV_comma_ and some spiced rum in my glass.
You got that right.  Can't ask for anything better after a long Monday.
Here's to a better Tuesday!
We had a flood in our basement and I lost a bunch of old photos.
Some Christmas ornaments.  I really regret not making backups of the photos.
my girlfriend got mad at me and destroyed my new car with a bat and knocked out my windshield.
You can imagine I was pretty red about it all
Ah_comma_ I often think back to when my husband and I first met and started dating. It was so long ago_comma_ yet feels like it was only yesterday. 
Yes_comma_ it does. So many good times and good memories. 
A few years ago_comma_ I thought I had breast cancer. It was such a scary time_comma_ but I tried to think positive. 
I was. And_comma_ yes_comma_ it did. I am so glad it did. I guess it's true what they say about the power of positive thinking.
I left my son with a baby sitter for the first time recently.
He's 18 months.  It went pretty well!  I think it was worse for me than him haha
I've been talk to someone for quite a while and we finally expressed feeling for each other.
I think they do_comma_ I hope so
I wish I lived in Manhattan. My friend got lucky enough to get a job and move there.
Yeah_comma_ maybe someday! There is so much to see there! Lots of great cuisine places too.
have you ever received a bad hair do?
i got a awful haircut today_comma_ all i can do is put on a hat. just burns me up. 
yeah_comma_ im gonna have to go shorter_comma_ i realize everyone can't do hair. 
and i still had to pay her. i feel like i got hustled. 
I got invited on a whitewater rafting trip this weekend. I haven't been in so long_comma_ I'm running circles out of excitement.
It can be exciting as heck. Sometimes a little dangerous too but that's half the fun!
My mom got scammed out of hundreds of dollars.
It was some internet phishing thing.  She had zero recourse.  I guess it's actually a little lucky she didn't lose more.
I was so sad growing up. I always wanted a horse and my parents never got me one. 
No_comma_ I never did. That made me real sad as well. 
Some one broke into my hose and stole a old record player I had.
No not really but record player was my moms and it was all I had that was hers and I miss it alot.
Grrr! I just found out someone got my credit card info. They charged a couple of hundreds of dollars on it. 
Nope. :( It's such a pain too. Having to contact the credit card company and get a new card issued. 
I have been married and had someone hit on me recently_comma_ he was pretty good looking
It was flattering of course_comma_ but I love my husband and would not ruin our relationship for a few moments of pleasure
You have to think about your family_comma_ your kids_comma_ all of those you would hurt_comma_ for what?
I spent a couple hundred dollars on a purse_comma_ which is A LOT for me_comma_ and it started fraying in days.
Right?  I'd barely used it!  Luckily the store agreed to replace it.
This week_comma_ I ran 60 miles in total.  After I finished up my long run on Sunday I just sat around for the rest of the day.
It was a pretty grueling week.  Still_comma_ no better feeling than being done and being able to just sit for the rest of the day.
I had to have some blood work recently to see if I had cancer... It was so nerve wracking waiting for the results. 
Thanks. Yes_comma_ it turns out I didn't have cancer. I was so relieved. 
one day my car would not start_comma_ apprehensively I went to a close by home and knocked on the door
it wasent my home_comma_ but a strangers home_comma_ I knocked on the door and a very large tattooed man answered
super scary_comma_ then he asked me to come on in!!
one time I saw an abandoned dog so I took him in and bottle fed him until he was way better to be adopted
yeah it's a very fulfilling feeling. I can't believe people are capable of doing such a thing
Oh my gosh! I was outside the other day_comma_ and what did my eyes see? A rattlesnake! Ack! I was never so terrified in my life! 
Yes they can. Thank goodness my husband was home and killed that sucker! 
My friend lost her oldest son in a car wreck a few days ago. I can't imagine the pain she is feeling.
I have been praying a lot. The worst part was he just got engaged and his fiance is pregnant. That poor baby has to grown up without it's daddy.
I got spayed in the face with wound juices
ok so i used to work as a wound care specialist and i was helping a coworker. There is a thing called a pulse lavage amd it sprays water in the wound....
lol. We ran out of face shields and she accidentally sprayed me in the face. 
I made sure I had plenty from then on. I had to go through a special shower and have my eyes checked. It was horrible
I love playing table tennis_comma_ so I was pretty sure I was going to beat my Dad last time I played him.
No I lost_comma_ but it was a close game! Haha_comma_ it can be a good workout when it gets really competitive!
Oh my goodness! I was really stressed out the other night and ate a whole container of ice cream by myself. 
I had a really hard test coming up and was afraid I wasn't going to pass it. I felt so bad afterwards eating all that ice cream. 
I let my dog off the leash in the park the other day and he never strayed too far from me the whole time. He came any time I called him and is such a good boy!
He is a cream color Labrador 
I feel nervous most of the time but when my regional boss comes into town it gets pretty bad
yeah im afraid i will make a bad impression and loose my job. The worst things possible always plays through my head  
My boys made me so happy last year. They both came 1800 miles away to visit me at Christmas. 
Yes_comma_ it was. It was one of the happiest days of my life. My one son also got me a kitchenaid for Christmas. 
A coworker of the opposite sex was recently hitting on me and trying to get me to cheat on my partner.
I told them to back off as I was happily married and I would never do that to my spouse.
Yes_comma_ people are not very faithful anymore.
I felt sad that I was not asked to be the bridesmaid at a close friends wedding
We have been friends for about 5 years now.  I was happy for her. Just shocked at the situation
The other day I wasn't too sure about letting my dog off his leash but he seemed to be doing really well recently so I let him off and he was quite obedient and never strayed too far away from me!
He is a lab.
I was playing a game recently and it reminded me of old times playing with my grandpa. We'd play Chess for so many hours.
Indeed he was! I have a lot of good memories with him.
I am starting a new job and am so nervous but equally excited.
Thank you.  It was a tough decision to leave my current job though.
So true.  Broaden your horizons and challenge yourself.  
I've been going to the same Thai restaurant for about 10 years now. It's the best and they always keep me coming back each week!
Hah they just may at this point!
I buy a lottery ticket every week. No luck so far but I'll keep trying.
I dream of winning. I need to break this cycle of living paycheck-to-paycheck. 
Maybe someday...
My kids started school last Tuesday and no school supply lists were put out online or in stores. I didn't get a list until 4 days before school started. I had to send them to school with no supplies until I could afford to buy them some on Friday. 
Yeah it was awful. Really made me feel crappy. I am just happy that they at least had new clothes and shoes.
So I was cleaning up some old papers and I found something I wasn't expecting to see.
No_comma_ not at all. I was really happy to find it.
Some love letters my boyfriend (now my husband) had written me when we were dating.
I am very excited today! 
My friend is having a birthday party today and I haven't seen her in over a year! 
Hey_comma_ I am feeling so proud of my dog today. 
He learned a new trick today_comma_ it took me days of training him before he caught on
Guess what_comma_ I was really surprised today.
My friends threw my a birthday party! :)
Recently I've been driving my friend's mom to and from the hospital for her chemo treatments. My friend is in the military and she can't drive so it's about the only way for her to get there.
A little troubling sometimes but It hasn't been too terribly hard to fit in most of the time
my mom gave me some earrings when i got married_comma_ they have been in our family for a long time. i was surprised that she trusted me with them. 
i know_comma_ i couldn't believe it myself. i thought she would've given them to my sister. 
yes_comma_ i guess so. thanks alot
Recently I was sitting outside relaxing with a drink in my backyard and just felt quite at peace with things and enjoyed the nice weather.
Yes I love nature as well. It's always nice to relax outside!
You will never guess what just happened! 
I lent a stranger my phone and he dashed off with it!! I am so angry! 
We have a new member of our family!
Huh? Anyway_comma_ the new member is a bunny! My daughter rescued it from an animal shelter.
once I was in a drive-by shooting
yeah I'm good. I was just in the wrong place. My trunk had a bullet hole in it
Ill try I work around there. It gets pretty bad
Recently my dog got out of the yard and ran to the neighbors and ran all around their house upsetting their dogs! It was quite annoying but eventually he came to me after I called to him for a bit.
Yes it was quite distressing as I live next to a major street! Luckily he didn't cross it and simply went next door but still!
Have you ever had a dog that got sick and vomited in the house?
well when mine did last week when I went to clean it up it stuck so bad it almost made vomit too.
I recently went on vacation.
The beach. I just sat and listened to the waves while reading a novel.
Just a couple hours drive. It made me relaxed yet happy.
Im Not the best looking guy ok. At a party I went up to the hottest girl in the room and started chatting with her
she was nice but totally uninterested. I was proud I was able to do it though. 
I feel so ashamed today! :( 
 walked into my office late and in the middle of a important meeting
I had to apologize_comma_ but luckily all my co-workers were understandable and gave me a summary of what was discussed. 
On my way to work I say a guy doing a trick on his bicycle. It was pretty rad
for sure. He had dreads and was rididing like an 8 year olds bike
You will never guess what I found today in the attic! 
I found a photo of me and my husband when we were young and feel very nostalgic thinking about it
It is embarrassing falling in the sewer because of texting while walking.
not today but last week. Its funny but embarrassing 
Man... i just lost the championship game for my football team
Yea it wasn't grea a lot of my friends will be sad for days.
It was our senior year....
I just found a bat living in my sunroom! He seemed to be there for a few weeks now.
There must be a hole somewhere in the room. We've got way more bats than normal flying through the property this summer.
Yeah that's a good idea. I'm not an expert either lol.
I went to staff at a teen camp and I had to prepare mentally and physically.
Yes I think it was a very rewarding experience! It was exhausting at the same time though! They have lots of activities!
Have you ever been to Six flags?
I went las summer and got on a Roller Coaster for the first time and it Scared me to death i'll never do it again.
I had a job interview a while back_comma_ and on the bus ride over_comma_ I sat on some gum.
Those slacks were ruined.  I didn't even know I had sat in until the interview was over and the guy pointed it out.
He said_comma_ "luckily you be making enough now so you won't need to ride the bus anymore."  I took that as a sign that I got it.
a few years back i was addicted to drugs and alcohol... i could not take care of my responsibilities...
it started when i was 14 i was hanging out with the wrong people and i got really bad before i realized i needed help. i went to rehab and changed my life around_comma_ i stay healthy these days i'm about a year sober
i will! a lot depends on the person in rehab and the attitude they have in there! thanks it was great talking to you!
I have been feeling a little sad lately
My friend has been diagnosed with cancer recently but I have been helping her out by paying her visits everyday
I am so happy!! 
I have just won the lottery! Can you believe that!! I am the 1 in 1 million! :D
I won $15 million dollars! I think I am finally going to be able to buy y dream house and pay for my children's education :) 
I read the driving permit booklet probably 10 times cover to cover_comma_ before I ended up taking the actual test.
I did! I did tremendously_comma_ got them all right. I think I went a little overkill_comma_ to be honest..
I totally made a fool of myself at Walmart the other day_comma_ I was wearing a white outfit and there was a very attractive man in front of me and I tripped and fell. 
Yep_comma_ I had a massive brown stain on my white shirt_comma_ and of course my coffee is hot so it is burning me slightly_comma_ I just got up and walked back to my car
I accidentally had expired milk today and it tasted gross.
I think so. I didn't have that much_comma_ thankfully_comma_ or else I would've probably spent the day vomiting. 
Yeah_comma_ exactly. At least milk isn't so sneaky_comma_ right? 
You will never guess what happened today! I am so embarrassed!!
I tripped over a man's foot and landed right on top of a very grumpy man who shoved me into another guy! 
No_comma_ it actually happened at the subway_comma_ I guess the man was in a rush for work so he shoved me out of his way when I tripped. 
It was so weird watching As Told By Ginger and Hey Arnold and the Rugrats the other day_comma_ I had such a nostalgic feel
Haha_comma_ I loved it_comma_ by I tried letting my kids watch it and the ywould not have it_comma_ they were like what is this weird stuff haha
My favorite day of the week has been Wednesdays for the last few years.
Wednesdays are new comic book day.  It's the only thing I have to look forward to lately.
There's just nothing else going on in my life lately.
I have been feeling a little jealous lately :( 
I am so jealous of my friend_comma_ Mary_comma_ she has finally got accepted into Medical school_comma_ but I am still waiting on my application to be approved. 
Have you ever stole candy from the store when you were a kid?
yes once when I was seven when I whent to the pharmacy with my dad.And when he found out when we got back out to the car he made me go back into the store by myself and return it and tell the pharmacist what I had done!
I had an interview for a hospital I want to volunteer at but I felt a little under-qualified 
 I haven't heard back from them yet! Hopefully they email me soon because I would love to volunteer at a hospital.
I hope so too...
My old roommate got a boyfriend_comma_ and obviously_comma_ she started spending a lot more time with him than at our apartment. 
I eventually did_comma_ but I didn't realize how I really felt about her instead she was never around.
I am so ready for tomorrow night! 
There is going to be a formal dance party! I have been practicing my dance moves all night and doing my make up! 
When I was a kid_comma_ I went on a few trips to the Mountain for some snowboarding lessons_comma_ come Christmas time you bet I was just praying for a snowboard of my own
I did! The anxiety and waiting paid off that Christmas morning. Reflecting back_comma_ the shape of the present should've gave away the gift_comma_ but I couldn't take any chances assuming.
I'm SO afraid of my neighbors new pit bull ! Every morning our neighbor lets out the dog - he immediately heads towards MY driveway to get MY newspaper_comma_ runs off and tears it to shreds !
I'm so glad it was the newspaper and not ME ! I used to go for early morning walks. But not anymore.
I have been really hopeful about the future lately! :) 
Yes I am_comma_ I have almost finished up medical school. Once I a done_comma_ I want to become a world class doctor who helps those in second world countries
I have been feeling very angry lately! You will never guess what happened. 
Oh yeah_comma_ It is definitely bad. I am furious_comma_ my step brother sold my laptop so that he could buy a new gaming station!
I had a bad experince when I was a kid when my dog ran away.
Yes when I came home the next day my mom had found him and boy was I happy.
So I cosigned on my boyfriend's apartment a few year's back to make up for his horrible credit.
Well_comma_ we live together now so it turned out to be a good gamble so far.
In the 8th grade_comma_ my friend and I sold the most chocolate bars in our entire school. Our prize ultimately ended up being a pair of New Balance shoes. $1150 in sales_comma_ for a pair of $25 kids shoes_comma_ each.
I was devastated. We thought we were going to get a TV_comma_ or a Playstation or something. Nope_comma_ just a pair of some old boring shoes that only 60 year old men wore. Livid.
when you were  a child did you ever get seperated from you family while at a public outing?
I did when we went to the county fair and iwas crying and looking every where for my parents_comma_ It  was terrible.
Bleh_comma_ I just had the worst food ever. 
I was at cMdonalds and was given a rotten cheese burger. I almost puked after I ate it. 
I am so disappointed in myself! 
I promised I would help my mom buy groceries on my way home from work because she has a had a really stressful day_comma_ but I completely forgot!
My brother took my favorite tanktop from me to play basketball when we were both teenagers. He ended up getting into a scuffle with someone at the courts_comma_ and the shirt got torn in two..
Technically_comma_ yeah. He just bought one off the rack at Walmart. It was the same size_comma_ but I had history with the old one. Just not the same_comma_ you know?
I feel so guilty... :( 
I left my dog alone at home all day because I had to go support my friend at a charity event. It lasted a lot longer than I anticipated 
I accidentally stepped on someone's toe at the grocery store and they really looked like they were in pain
Of course! I probably apologized 20 times. I felt so guilty.
He looked like he understood that I was really sorry and that it was an accident but he couldn't help but grab his foot in pain! 
Did you know that I am actually terrified of the ocean? 
I hate sharks and not knowing what is down there in the deep blue sea. the thought of being stranded in the ocean terrifies me
I have been feeling very happy lately! :) 
Yes_comma_ my boyfriend and I have finally started to get serious in or relationship. We have even started talking about marriage and children! :) 
First time I ever went to a traditional Japanese cook-house I couldn't believe to variety of food. Moreover_comma_ I couldn't believe the variety of food that was still moving...
All of the food tasted so good_comma_ but I couldn't get over how recently they killed the courses. Still-moving octopus? No thank you.
As a kid_comma_ me and my friends would often try to find haunted houses in the old part of town. Can't quite explain that one night where I swear I saw something moving around in one of them. It felt and looked so real
I don't know what's more terrifying_comma_ whether it was a ghost or that there was someone still inside.. 
You will never guess what I am afraid of
No_comma_ flying cockroaches! *shivers* Just thinking about them gives me chills up my spine. They are huge_comma_ nasty and never die no matter how many times you hit them
During a drive from Seattle to Los Angeles in the winter_comma_ I got stuck in my car because they closed a pass because of heavy snow.
Yea_comma_ luckily I had extra blankets and some food in the car to hold me over.
Only four hours_comma_ long enough for a quick nap.
My aunt that I had not seen in 10 years came to visit me last weekend 
Yes. I hadn't seen her in so long because she lived in Cuba for all those years. She recently moved to Spain and wanted to visit my family and I. 
Definitely! It was beautiful moment when our family finally reunited! 
I am so proud of my puppy! 
He learned two new tricks today. I was able to teach him to give me a highfive and roll over! he is the cutest pup! :) 
I am so grateful that I have great friends :) 
Yes I totally agree_comma_ the other day when I was at the bar_comma_ my best friend was so kind to make sure I got home safe after I had a little too uch to drink :) 
A school friend of mine got detention for a week after he was caught with a note that had some swear words in it. I was the one that passed it to him.. 
He was a courageous one_comma_ and took the fall himself. Which actually made me feel even worse_comma_ but it taught me a lesson about integrity and honor.  
My son recently got married_comma_ and I gained a new daughter in law. The wedding was beautiful_comma_ everyone had a great time !
She's quite the gal. Treats my son with the utmost respect.
i didn't cheat on my partner.
Yes_comma_ for a relationship to last.
My partner cheated on me!
You know it is hard to be an immigrant and be alone and far from your family 
I am originally from Chile_comma_ but I live in Canada. It is sad to be alone for Christmas_comma_ new year or my birthday. 
yes I do sometimes. But no always. Anyways_comma_ I look for refugee in God when I am sad or feel alone.
I had to borrow money from family_comma_ I hate having to rely on them but debt was just piling up
As was mine_comma_ but I just felt like at this point I would be able to do it myself
I have an irrational fear of flying which I faced when I traveled 8 hours on a plane by myself 
I was flying from Florida to Italy. I was terrified on the flight_comma_ but the destination was worth it.
Yeah_comma_ it was. It was also my second time flying in general!
I was still a little scared_comma_ but after take off_comma_ I loosened up a little. I watched my favorite series downloaded on my phone and that seemed to distract me well.
Have you ever watched the Bachelor?
It's a dating reality TV show on ABC. Anyways_comma_ I was watching a couple of weeks ago and managed to eat an entire box of cookies!
I am so annoyed with my brother...ugh sometimes I wish I was an only child.
He borrowed my lucky pencil when he knew I had an important test today. And he knows I can't function without my lucky pencil during a test! :( 
One time I went to downtown with an old pant and when I was in the street the pant ripped
I think so_comma_ bot nobody said nothing. I tried to cover myself with a purse
Thanks_comma_ me too. I went to the closest store to buy a new pant.
I attended a bachelor party this summer. Things got a little out of hand.
One of my friends hired some entertainment that my girlfriend would not approve of.
That is just it! I was so proud of myself I did not do anything with the entertainment that she would not have approved of.
A while back_comma_ someone who was a good friend accused me of a crime that I didn't commit.
It comes out that she had a multiple personality disorder_comma_ and sometimes that makes her believe things that didn't happen did.
That or some therapy.  Luckily I had plenty of witnesses against her.
I got called into the bosses office last week.
That is just it it was. They found out I did not preform as well as first expected on some projects.
I just had my first child a few weeks ago. I guess the distraction got to me and effected my performance.
i believed a friend who was always telling me lies
I caught him in a lie.
He told people i was mean to him.
I had a car accident. I cant walk anymore.
Yes. I miss my legs and freedom.
I visited to Greece and was amazed by all the beautiful landscape I saw!
Yes_comma_ Athens is one of the oldest cities in the world! I went to an island though. I was amazed by all the rocky hills and clear waters.
Yes_comma_ it is called Mykonos. It's a very touristic location.
You should definitely if you like the beach! It has one of the most beautiful beach landscapes I have ever seen.
My boyfriend is adorable. He gave me a gift and wrote a romantic note with it.
it says he feels his heart doesnt belong to him anymore_comma_ but belongs to me and that time and space will not change the way he feels for me
yeah. I feel loved
My grandmother recently passed away. She had more flowers and grieving cards that we could have hoped for.
Thank you
I volunteered to babysit my neighbor's children.
The children are so sweet.
I love to go for nice long walks in the park with my dog.
When we are walking we sometimes go for about an hour.
It keeps us both healthy and strong.
I was beaten by my ex_comma_ when I was pregnant of his child. 
yes I did report him_comma_ he went to jail and we broke up
Yes. I am a single mother_comma_ but it is better and I thank God he is not in my heart anymore.

Stuffed animals are always an endearing thing to hang on to.

I traveled out of the country for the first time last year.
Poland_comma_ it was where my father was born.
I was expecting a important mail. I had to wait for a month.
It wasn't really really important. Maybe third-tier important.
When I stepped into the chicken coup_comma_ I was rushed by a bunch of hungry chickens! They apparently are fed someone comes in and opens a bucket.
There were around 20 at the time. However_comma_ I soon learned that they didn't want to eat me.
The chicken feed_comma_ apparently. The neighbors usually feed them every morning_comma_ and they were waiting expectantly.
I has cured my fear of chickens_comma_ actually!
I had a really good night last night after a lot of stress

I might throw up_comma_ I don't know what to think. I've never seen her do something like that
I thought I saw my friend at the store but when I said hi_comma_ it turned out to be a stranger. I went red in the face.
They were very confused when they faced me.
I didnt want anyone to talk with my boyfriend.
I dont like it when he talk with others especially girls.
I just finished my final exams and have been constantly checking my phone to see if the marks have been uploaded.
I hope so_comma_ I am very eager to get my marks back.
Thanks a lot!
My wife is truly been trustworthy_comma_ she never keep secret from me".
We don't do secrets from each other
I have no intention of cheating on my partner and I hope they know this.
I just hope that they realise that. I would hate for them to ever feel unsure or insecure. 
My partner. I hope when I am out that she knows she can trust me
A friend of mine recently had their car breakdown. 
Yeah_comma_ thankfully i was able to drop off my car to help them over the weekend

I was supposed to meet up with someone to sell a belonging_comma_ but they flaked. I wasted my time!
Yes it was.
I recently purchased a Nintendo Switch and playing it reminded me of my childhood playing games with my friends.
I played Mario Odyssey which is incredibly fun.
That is what I heard too_comma_ which is why I got it!
I am praying that I did well on my exams.
I would say that I studied well. There was not one day that I took off to do something else other than study.
man_comma_ I can't believe how fast my best friend was in the 5k today
you could say that....I mean_comma_ I knew he was good at running_comma_ but I never knew how good he looked doing it.....

Has your house ever been caught in a flood or natural disaster?
I haven't had one that bad but wee expireced a flood last week and it almost came the door of our house _comma_ my neighbor was not so lucky his  whole house was breached by the water and it did extensive damage.
We have 100 people coming over soon to pray over my sister and her house. I'm excited!
No_comma_ she's got stage 4 cancer - it's the last day of a 24/7 week of prayer_comma_ with 100s of people around the world praying for her. There's been some incredible things happen!
How good is that - such great news. What did you guys find helpful for looking after yourselves as you cared for your dad?
My girlfriend has been away visting her mother for 3 weeks now.
I think about her every night and I wish she was here with me.
My son wet his pants at the park the other day. 
He turned red in the face. Luckily I was there to cover him up and get him to the bathroom quickly
I will be meeting my mom again after she went missing for 30 years. Meeting her soon_comma_ and I'm not sure if she still loves me or not.
I searched for her on the Internet for the past 20 years. Finally_comma_ 6 months ago_comma_ her address came up in an Internet search for the first time!
Thank you. That means a lot considering that I have been wondering  her feelings for so long.
do you have any kids in college?
well they grow fast and mine is all grown up and going away for college and we are going to miss her so much.
my boyfriend sometimes looks at his ex instagram or facebook. 
I blocked my ex from social media. But sometimes he watches my ex facebooks and instagram too.  
I am angry sometimes. he wants me to show he is better and my ex. And he talks bad about his ex. saying she became ugly.
well_comma_ life's looking pretty crappy for me now.....sigh
I didn't get the promotion I thought I was going to get_comma_ and now I can't take my girlfriend to Disney World. she'll probably leave me now
well they probably won't....I can't even get out of bed
god_comma_ I am going to SMACK my brother right now!!!!
he's just so obnoxious! I was trying to get w my girlfriend and he kept coming into the room to interrupt us_comma_ on purpose!
alright_comma_ if you insist. be right back
man_comma_ I was just looking through my parents wedding album.....I can't believe how young they were
sort of...but it just made me think about how young I used to be too....the time sure has passed by
looking back is always fun tho. time has been my best friend
many years ago when my wife and i first moved in with each other there were lots of debates about money
Well since i work more than I am at home we decided that she would handle the money and only have to consult me on major matters or purchases.
I told her that if she ever messed up and we lost a house or something devisating happened that we would switch and i would take over.
I like to believe i would_comma_ though i would be handling the money from then on.
My girlfriend has a male friend she always confides in. I do not feel like she should discuss some of our personal issues with him.
That is good any advice for a young man and his relationship?
That is great advice I truly appreciate it. I love her to death and we recently had our first child together. 
Before any meeting I always make sure I am ready in case the boss calls on me. 
Yes he does. I always try to come up with outside the box ideas to solve issues
I do not mind being called on at all! I actually rather enjoy show casing my talents
If one of my customers has an issue I always find them an answer.
That is how you keep clients happy! Best part is it makes you feel good when you go home at night.
I participated in a marathon with my friend last week
1 month of training. And it would have been if I actually finished it. I had to stop halfway through
My foot started to bother me but mostly it's because my asthma was preventing me from getting enough air
That's true. I can always try again
My son recently was jumping on the couch and broke it.
I was so mad! I ended up telling him to get to his room and he would have to work off paying for a new couch
my girlfriend has been threatening me recently.....
she thinks I'm cheating on her but I'm not. I think she might hurt me
I don't know_comma_ I'm terrified. what should I do
I believe in my son_comma_ I know he will make me proud when his result will be out".
Exams. He has always made me proud his result. I read well
Have you ever been cliff jumping before?
Yeah me too! I went one time with my friends and I was really scared cause of the heights but I still managed to do it!
In High School I loved to play sports. Football was my favorite
Unfortunately I do not. I was not the best on the field and my brains were always my strong suit
Exactly! I am glad I got out of the sport without hurting myself perminantly.
As long as you stretch properly before working out you should be fine!
oh no oh yes oh no oh yes!!!
my girlfriend just told me that she's pregnant!
what do I do!!! I'm totally shocked!
I hope so I'm just so overwhelmed right now
: "I am fully ready for my exams which is starting next week
My Master's exams in philosophy
I was sick_comma_ but I needed some milk_comma_ so I let my neighbor take my credit card to the store to get some.
Yes_comma_ he got the milk and brought the receipt to show that's all he bought. 
I know! I was happy about that!
I trusted my brother would pay back the loan I gave him
He is in the process but he is definitely behind our agreed upon payback schedule
Thanks. I appreciate it!
I was very angry_comma_ my boss embarrassed me for nothing".
It was transfer of aggression_comma_ someone annoyed him but he later apologized
my dad bit someone
a family friend. I'm getting so tired of his drinking!
I'm going to lock him in a room and let him rot!
I just got home from the hospital and we carried with us my first child!
It was a little girl! I am truly terrified right now that I am going to break her. She seems so small and delicate.
I was recently passed up for another promotion at work. 
I truly am starting to think my boss hates me. He never gives me the good assignments and always degrades my work. 
That sounds like a great idea! I will try that.
That is true there may be some outside events causing this trouble at work.
maybe you shouldn't have gone in that room. 
The smoke you did not like because it reminded you of you're fathers smoking habit.
It's a very hard habit to quit.
I have a reoccurring nightmare that I am being eaten by zombies
It all started after watching the first season of walking dead
I decided one day that I would adopt an animal at an animal shelter_comma_ and I picked up a dog.
I named her Abby_comma_ it seemed to fit her and she learned it pretty quickly.
She is actually a mutt but mostly cocker spaniel!
I find spiders to be extremely creepy
Same here! They are just 8 legs of death. Do you know an average human eats 4 spiders every year while they sleep!
My dad wants me to work this job that I am completely uninterested in.
Yes. He is very stubborn though and wants me to live the life he believes is best for me. 
i can't wait to ride in a race car for the first time!

My family is helping out with the money for my marriage ceremony!
Some time within the next 2 weeks_comma_ we're still trying to decide on the exact date.
I was so prepared for the track meet. I spent the previous 4 years getting ready for it.
I ended up coming in 5th overall_comma_ but only the top 3 were able to represent our country. But its ok_comma_ I knew I had come into the meet in the best shape I could have.
I recently found out I need a root canal
No I have not I feel like it is my fault and I should have brushed more
Last year I took a trip to Mexico and basically hung out on the beach for a week.
I know_comma_ I saved up for a couple years and finally got a vacation_comma_ it was so peaceful and I was happy and relaxed!
I have everything I need in life. My girlfriend is amazing my son is kind and I have a new baby girl
Thank you! I am truly blessed to be where I am in life right now.
I accepted a job in a career field that I know I am not interested in. 
Yes_comma_ I am just accepting it for the time being. Just taking the position for the money. 
 "I fell down on stage while dancing_comma_ I felt so bad".
You could imagine !
My boyfriend got me a new fridge for my bday! I am super happy.

My landlords do not approve of dogs in my house so I had to leave my dog with my parents.
Everything is new inside_comma_ I guess they are afraid a dog would destroy something.
My son starts his first day of kindergarten next week!
Oh yes! he has not stopped talking about it all summer!
I was recently going through some cupboards and I found my old school tie and some photos. I'm not really someone who holds onto things_comma_ and I hated school_comma_ I don't really know why I kept them.
Not at all honestly. I'm not a very sentimental person generally. I think I kept them because I thought I might 'value' them later on_comma_ but looking back I really don't.
Yeah_comma_ I think you might be right!
One time I was having a couple of drinks with a friend and we started roughhousing and I broke my tailbone
ohhhh yeah_comma_ I was pretty embarrassed to say the least
Yeah we still laugh about it but_comma_ I think this injury is going to follow me for a long time to come
Last week I was offered a new job but I dont know if I will take it. I am scared to leave my current job.
Thats that thing_comma_ I dont know if it will be better at the new company.
I think you are right. I should talk to the new company.
I had an hectic interview _comma_I really don't know what to expect _comma_I'm curious to know what's next".
I mean the rigorous process of the interview weighed heavily on me
I was really embarrassed at school one day when I made a fool out of myself in front of my crush
I peed my pants. I was 7 years old_comma_ mind you
This one time_comma_ a girl I've known for a long time lost her place to stay. She had a lot of cats but_comma_ I let her crash at my place for a while.
Well_comma_ they stayed in my room too. They were sweet but_comma_ I'm not a huge animal fan
It's just the matter of the big little box next to my bed hahaha But_comma_ shes important to me so_comma_ I agreed to it
mmmmm I just had the best meal and I'm super full
a huge home cooked meal and now I'm lying in bed and I couldn't feel any better
yep and now I'm going to sleep like a baby
Ok_comma_ buckle up this one's sad. My fiance died when i was 18
It was an accidental OD but_comma_ I still feel like I could've saved her
It's pretty crushing but_comma_ I try to use art as an outlet for these repressed emotions. I know this was random chat but_comma_ thanks for listening anyway
I got into a fight with my wife lately and we were so mad with each other. 
Well we don't ever really fight over dumb things. And we also fight rarely. we are over the worst fights lol.
I drove past a lonely road where is a hideout for criminals".
You can ask that again.... Really scared!
I asked a woman to keep an eye on my bag whilst I went to the toilet.
Yeah_comma_ I felt I could rely on her for two minutes
My employer provides me with lots of training and support so I have become very faithful to them.
It really does. It makes working there much nicer.
They have a good attitude because the workers are good also.
You wanna know the most contented and peaceful time of day?
Drinking hot coffee outside. Your only company; the morning dew and the rising sun
well_comma_ my friend won the lottery
I'm green with envy! why does he get to win and I don't!!!
to make me mad_comma_ yeah! he better give me a bunch of it
Would you like to hear about one of the most anxious and exciting times of my life?
One time I took a Greyhoud bus from Atlanta Georgia to Seattle Washington. I was going to work on an organic farm
I've always had this steady drum beat within driving me towards risk_comma_ freedom and_comma_ adventure
I had to work with a partner for my senior thesis and he did nothing! Do you like group work?
Me too! I spent months on it and we ended up with the same grade.
Remember our beautiful dog at home? Well unfortunately he did recently. The family are so so sad.
He was old and died of old age. He was such a big part of the family.
He did.
I lost my job and had to ask my parents for money. I was so ashamed to ask for help.
They were. They really did get me out of a jam and I'm grateful to them.
I would say Karma is due to bring me some good positive vibes today
yeah lets just say I have had a lot of bad things happen recently_comma_ and now after helping a pregnant lady the other day i'm sure i'm due some help now too haha.
So_comma_ my best friend did something I had a very hard time forgiving him for
Well_comma_ it was a while back but_comma_ this beautiful girl was interested in me and_comma_ he knew it. He came in and directed all attention towards himself which stopped me entirely from pursuing a relationship
You're right. I've since stopped associating myself with him. It just hurt a lot to find out that someone you thought you could trust with your life didn't respect you in the same sense. Thank you so much
I remained with my girl after a long distance relationship
I feel his pain_comma_ it sucks at times.  It makes you cherish the moments you do have together though!
I hope it ends up the same way for me also_comma_ all the best to your brother!
I've been abroad for a while traveling but soon I'm going back to the US!
I've been in Mexico.
I was waiting on my wife until she can come with me to the US (getting her papers ready).
well_comma_ it's time. I'm going to ask the girl of my dreams out on a date
yep_comma_ and I know she'll say yes. she has to
because I'm the hottest piece of butt this side of the world!
So_comma_ I'm a musician and I recently had a really gratifying situation
I was playing drums with my friend's dad! He's really well versed.
THERE ARE NOTES. But what really left an impression was that he was pleased with my amateurish ability. (You should absolutely pick up drums they're so much fun and a great aerobic exercise)
it's time. I'm ready to go on the hardest mountain climb I've ever done
Everest. and I'm ready to face my death if need be
oh yeah I'll try to remind myself of that
I had always colored my hair at home but had a wedding comeing up so I wanted to finally get it done professionally.
No! It was terrible_comma_ I wanted light brown and when I got up from the chair it was so blonde. I was to upset to even say anything.
I get sentimental around Christmas. Christmases with my parents were the best but now they're gone.
I lost my dad a couple of years ago and my mother followed a year later. It is sometimes hard to get through Christmas without nostalgia.
One time I got pantsed in PE class. The other girls thought I should lose my pants while we were playing dodgeball.
I don't remember. I was pretty numbed out.
My parents made me go to a private school_comma_ actually. But I did convince them to let me go to public for Senior year_comma_ though.
My mom found my weed when I was younger
Oh boy_comma_ she yelled and carried on. I couldn't hide my shame
oh boy....I just screwed my whole life up and I want to die
ugh I just want to crawl into a hole. my whole school knows too
well unless someone ELSE farts right in their crush's cute face while her mouth was open
One time my friend dropped something heavy on my favorite guitar
It had a huge dent but_comma_ sounded fine. I was pretty mad but_comma_ I could tell it was an accident
The most awful time of my life was when my wife went to jail for a month. I'm glad it's all over.
Some old stuff from 2 years before but court was appointed this late!
Do you ever think you know someone and then you go to their house and find out their a HOARDER@
It came as a total shock! She would have been the last person I thought would be a hoarder
It was really tough to watch my father struggle with cancer. When he got the diagnosys I was devastated for him.
He passed away. At least he is no longer in pain.
My son wanted the tips of his new hair curt dyed blonde to start school.
It didn't seem that it would be a problem_comma_ since it wasn't a crazy color.  But_comma_ we ended up in the salon after I turned it orange by mistake lol.
They fixed it_comma_ but I am sure he won't let mom try to play hair stylist again.  I was so embarassed when I went to the salon lol.
We took a big leap of faith with our teenage son this weekend. We left him home overnight alone for the first time.
It went great! He's such a responsible kid_comma_ and we felt confident he would treat our home with respect and wouldn't have a party or anything like that!
I don't blame you.  It's definitely hard to do. It's good for them to know that you are relying on them to do the right thing though.
I have been a teacher for over 10 years. But have only taught the little kids. This year my district moved me up to the high school.
I was- Monday was my first day. My goal was not to make a fool out myself.
I got into a fight with my brother this weekend. I said some things I shouldn't have said. 
I did apologize but I still can't shake the feeling that I went too far. I'm not proud of how I acted at all. 
I was so naive and trusting in the past and people took advantage of me a lot. I'm a lot more careful now.
I am careful around everybody. But I appreciate the warning.
well_comma_ I have faith that everything will turn out okay today. it's a big day
getting the results back on whether I have lymphoma or not. but I've been having positive dreams all week and know I'll be ok
don't you mean positive?? are you trying to jinx me??
ohh....well good to know_comma_ I should tell my doctor that
i play in a band and recently we had a concert and played to the most appreciative audience ever
well_comma_ it was a rock concert_comma_ and there was so many people over 1000!
i kept my friend's wallet which he'd forgotten at m y place and i felt trustful
no. whenever we meet i will handover to him
i'm always scared that something bad will happen in my life.
i am always scared that i can't control a lot of things that happens in my life

he's a senior in highschool_comma_ and I just found out that he cheated on his homework and tests. every single one of them_comma_ for 4 years
I think I'm going to disown him. like_comma_ legally
I thought my wife had umbilical hernia. Which is a serious health condition. Doctor told her she might die or end up in an ER! 
No! The doctor was completely wrong and it was a misdiagnosis which we thought it was but there was also this fear.
When I was offered the job of my dreams_comma_ I knew I had everything I could ever need. I finally felt content in my life.
I was hired to work at a children's hospital in my city. It really made waking up in the morning worth it every day.
I have always homeschooled my kids.
Well_comma_ we put them into the local public schools this year and even though its so scary for me_comma_ they are loving it!
as a writer i prefer to always be alone
i agree with you_comma_ i get a lot of inspiration when i'm alone.
I remember I remember when I had my little Labrador puppy. But I had to give her away.
Yes she is safe. I was pretty young back then and already had another dog. Couldn't keep both unfortunately.
 "Am very happy to have the best family in the world".
Yes_comma_ we understand ourselves and know our boundaries. we are always happy 
I made a girl pregnant without marrying her_comma_ I feel so terrible because I am a very religious person
I need to go and confess my sins if not I won't be able to deal with the burden
Amen
I loved going trick or treating with my daughter. It used to get me so eager and excited every year.
She just turned 18. She doesn't like to trick or treat as much.
Thank you. She is wonderful.
I felt comfortable and at ease with a new friend_comma_ she took the time to help me learn and be comfortable doing something new.
She had me go rock climbing with her at her gym. It was so scary at first!
That is awesome_comma_ and it's so rewarding afterwards! I'm glad you got to experience that as well with a friend.
i hate when people tell me what to do
i don't think anyone should have the power or the right to tell you what's good for you if you didn't ask for help.
Unlike many of my friends I was confident when I went to job interviews and I always got the job. I guess I was lucky.
I guess you're right and I appreciate the way you look at this. I did have the right qualifications_comma_ so maybe that boosted my confidence.
I've been eating pizza almost every day lately and I'm satisfied with it. I have no shame.
I like any kind honestly. But Hawaiian wins my heart! Pepperoni is good too.
when i left my family's house to study in another city i got upset.
i'm studying biomed_comma_ it's gonna be worth it.
i am loyal to my wife and i'll always be.
i don't get it why people cheat and hurt each other_comma_ but i suppose because they are never happy with what they have and only feel grateful for it after they lose it.
Someone slapped me_comma_ I got so mad
I didn't step on her intentionally_comma_ that was a temper issue
My son is starting his senior year.  I am finding myself feeling so emotional about it. 
Yes_comma_ I have this feeling of excitement for his new adventure_comma_ but also worry. And I'm just going to miss him so much_comma_ he's a wonderful kid.
I don't know that he'll appreciate that! Mostly I think I'll look at his childhood pictures for a while and have a good cry.
i had a fight with my mother and i said a lot of horrible things_comma_ i regret doing that.
i did_comma_ but everytime i think of how disrespectful i was_comma_ i just want to die. i hope he'll forgive me

Last year during my birthday_comma_ I received a gold necklace
From my Grandma_comma_ so surprising_comma_ 
I went to the public toilet and went out with a toilet paper sticking out of my pants...
Yeah sure_comma_ it was years ago!
I've been married for 30 years. I love my husband but I kind of miss the fun of flirting and dating someone new.
Probably so! I am very loyal and I would never cheat on him! He's a good guy. 
I agree. I've seen what happens when people cheat. It's not pretty!
I missed my good friend's birthday party last month because I was too busy and forgot.
I was honest_comma_ they were still upset which makes me feel bad. I tried to make it up to her.
I hope that she does_comma_ it made me feel awful. But here's to good thinking and positive vibes_comma_ she will come around!
my cat died last week_comma_ and i can't get over it.
especially if that pet is the only things that you have.
I went skydiving a few years ago. It was a rush!
It went really well! I really want to do it again. I went tandem with the instructor and really had to have faith he knew what he was doing!
Earlier this year I was going through a very hard time with the illness of a family member. Out of the blue_comma_ my dog died.
I had him about 7 years. I loved him so much and having him die when he did was more than I could take at that moment. 
Yes_comma_ everyone was great and I am feeling much better now. We did get a new puppy_comma_ but I still miss my old dog!
i was shattered by the news today_comma_ seeing all those innocent die made me very sad
arabic countries always have unfair government and war going on which make me question _comma_ why are they doing this?
I cooked a big turkey and served it to my in-laws. I embarrassed myself because it was terrible in the end.
No. But I used sugar instead of salt. It wasn't good.
I've had a slight financial struggle recently. I  don't see a way out of it. 
My girlfriend has gone a little crazy with spending frivolously. 
I think I've hadhad an epiphany. After not being serious about religion ever_comma_ I may have to turn it over to God... 
Lol... I went to a Christian school. Never cared before  but now I'm 47. Maybe He can just give me a quick loan??? 
I sent a parcel to my cousin recently and it never arrived. It cost me $50 
I did think that it had probably been stolen but I try to see the best in people so I hoped it had just been delayed. That was 2 months ago and it still has not arrived. Maybe it is time to move on
yes it was a gift for his wedding. I have contacted the delivery service but they have thousands of parcels and it takes a long time to locate a single one. I don't know what to do next
Thank you for your kind words and wishes
i am satisfied with my current life.
it is_comma_ because being grateful for what you have is better than everything.
A tornado hit our home and destroyed it_comma_ as well as our car.

I trained for 2 months and beat 300 people to get the gold. It was a very humid day so everyone struggled but I can only run in my lunch break when it is hottest so I was used to it
I have had a few injuries but since seeing a physio therapist I have learnt a lot about injury prevention and recovery. It has changed my life
The dog I grew up with died a few years ago. I was really sad about it.
Yeah I don't live near home any more so I wasn't able to say goodbye. Losing a pet is always pretty hard.
I'm 47 years old and have been taking psychotropic meds for well over 30 years. I'm having more and more trouble with them working properly. It's happening a lot now. I'm at my wits end
Oh yes.. We've made quite a few changes over the past few years  They don't seem to work like they did in the past  Not as well_comma_ nor as long. Very scary
Thanks for the kind wishes! Hopefully we can find a fix before I slip too far into the abyss...

My neighbor recently had a baby! I brought her and her family a ton of food.
I had brought her some chicken for sandwiches_comma_ lasagna_comma_ hot dogs with buns_comma_ Powerade_comma_ and also a dessert of strawberry cheesecake.
I never miss making coffee in the morning and delivering it to my wife in bed.
She needs it otherwise she won't get out of bed.
My daughter called and said she had bad news for me which made me apprehensive. She apparently scratched the car.
It was a big scratch but easily fixed with a pain job. She got me anxious over such a nothing thing_comma_ though.
Nothing happened to her_comma_ which is what counts. She was lucky.
I feel alone most of the time and I kinda enjoy it
At work I am_comma_ so when I get home I am perfectly fine being alone

I was terrified! At first I was so excited_comma_ but once we got there I didn't know if I wanted to go in!

I will watch for the next sale.  I love them too.  Still frustrated though that she got to it before me!
I was pregnant with my son and my husband would bring me chocolate shakes home every night. I would get so excited for him to be home with it!

We have changed it multiple times and nothing is really working. Its so frustrating. I just want myself back and I cant have him
I saw my stepmother for the first time in 15 years since my daddy passed away. It was totally unplanned and It was quite a shock to see her. 
Most definitely. It brought a lot of pain to the surface that I thought I had gotten past. I seem to be dwelling a bit now. 
Eventually. There a good memories mixed in there that I can recall fondly too. Sentiment is like that...you can smile while you're crying

I love my wife alot_comma_ we had a set of twin 3 times in a row so the children are 6 plus myself and her all 8

I am a little bit uncomfortable with knowing that my Ex has HIV

When I was younger I slept in the attic of what everyone thought was a haunted house. There'd be shadowy spectres and sounds all night every night.

Wow_comma_ policy recently changed at work_comma_ not due to anything I did_comma_ and they are now paying me extra money!

I asked a friend I'd had for a very long time to be in my wedding. She agreed and then completely disappeared from my life.
No_comma_ I didn't. I even offered to pay for everything for her since she had to travel. I guess she wasn't as good of a friend as I thought.
A man followed me as I was walking home last night. I walked really fast to avoid him catching up with me.
No. I got home safe and sound.

I had to go to the car dealer to buy a new vehicle several years ago. I always get so nervous when I have to talk to the dealers.

I don't know what kind it was.  I screamed and ran back in my house.  Sent my son out to handle him. lol
Now every time I go out there I look before I open the door! lol  I swear he was smiling at me.  lol
I'm thinking about owning my first home.
Well_comma_ I've been putting money away for a while now. I've almost got enough for a down payment.
Yeah_comma_ I can't wait!
Have you ever had a family member everyone else doubted all the time.
M y brother was addicted to drugs for ten years biut this years he cleanded his act up and has been sober for 7 months. I knew he could do it.
When my dog Buddy died_comma_ I was horribly upset.
I hope your dogs live as long as Buddy did_comma_ he was a good dog.
Do you like watching movies or reading books?
I love movies and I waited for the past 3 years for the Avengers for movie to get released. I was frantic when it made it to our theater I was overwhelmed.
I took my little cousin to the community pool the other day and it reminded me of when I was in his shoes.
Yes exactly_comma_ and cooling considering the summer heat.
went to the bathroom and saw something you don't see everyday.
Well when I went to wash my hands there was a from on the handle!
Sorry I meant frog. He was on the sink handle and I almost touched it!
I enjoy reminiscing on the better times in life.
Have you ever wondered why some people get put through trials in life?
I was caught cheating on a math test...
I was kicked out of the class and got a zero on the test
One of my co-workers got to be a close friend of mine. Then she decided that I was advancing faster than her and sabotaged my job.
No_comma_ I cut ties because it wasn't worth it to give her the satisfaction of a fight.
I tend to let my better half make all the important decisions in our life.
Yes! and he like too. I don't mind because he is pretty smart.
They're putting up a new playground near my house.
Yeah_comma_ should be nice.  I'll be able to walk there with my son.
I forgot to pay the electric bill last week so a lady came a turned the power off.
I made my late payment as quickly as possible and called my provider to ask them to turn my power on asap. I managed to get it back later that night.
My dog really seemed out of it and depressed the other day.
I thought maybe a bath might make him feel better and boy was I right! afterward he played for like 10 minutes! He is just getting old.
Thank! me too. He's got some years left I think.
I had the worst nightmare last night. I woke up screaming and shaking.
There was a maniac clown after me and he had a chainsaw. It seemed the faster I ran the closer he got!
I was gardening last weekend and have to move pots that have been sitting outside for years. I knew there were spiders!
I was very careful and scanned what I could see then I got a grip and threw them and kicked them around in the yard. I must have looked nuts!
Yep_comma_ there is not one spider I like. lol.
My best friend and I haven't been friends for super long_comma_ but I believe we will be in each other's lives forever. She's such a great person.
Exactly. We may not talk every day_comma_ but when we do talk again it's like nothing has changed.
I went to visit my mm last weekend. We enjoyed talking and looking through old photos.
We are just a few miles away from eachother. Me too. She also sent me home with some childhood pictures to share with my boyfriend.
Once_comma_ I bought this really pretty dress to go on a date. Then the worst thing happened!
No. My mom and I were hanging out sipping on red wine and I decided to try the dress on for her. That's when I tripped and spilled the wine on the front of my dress.
Nope_comma_ the dress was trashed. I had to wear something else. Wasn't as nice as that dress.
He was ok. LOL
My husband is going to accept a new job.  He's going to be out of state for two months.
I'm pretty sad_comma_ but I have to believe it's the right move for our family
It was cloudy outside earlier today but the weather is fickle so I can't count on there being rain.
Yea I like the rain too especially during the summer. I meant that my local weather often seems likely to rain without actually doing so.
Hey there_comma_ I have feelings for this girl
I think so_comma_ but it's a little scary
I was going to go see a new movie that came out last weekend.
It was a new comedy movie.  But then my babysitter cancelled and I couldn't go.
This weekend I'm going on a road trip to visit friends who live 8 hours away.
This will be our third year going.  I'm hoping that it will be as good as it has in previous years.
Last night I just felt like a couch potato and watched some movies.
I watched tears of the sun. Got myself a blanket and popcorn and my favorite animal to cuddle with. it was nice to just veg out.
I hope you do!
My puppy just passed away
He was a yorkie. It was so sudden.
Yeah_comma_ it's definitely not fun
I'm a teacher.  School starts back for me in two weeks.
Hard to tell how the class will be_comma_ that makes me a bit nervous.
I broke up with my abusive boyfriend of five years.
They are. I was ashamed that I had stayed in that relationship for so long. But_comma_ I met someone who is the complete opposite of him.
Everyone deserves to be happy in whatever capacity that may mean for who they choose to spend their time with.
One of cats decided to poop on the tv remote last night_comma_ even though I had just changed their litter box. I love him_comma_ but that really grossed me out.
I did_comma_ luckily it was a cheap universal remote that I already had a replacement for_comma_ but I still don't know what possessed my cat to use the remote instead of the clean litter box.
So_comma_ my boyfriend cam over to help with some yard work.
Yes we did but he will never let me forget that day. I was wearing jeans and was working so hard i didn't realize I had plumbers butt most of the day. I was so horrified!
Yeah_comma_ I had one on but it just wan't long enough. Now I have longer shirts!
I ordered a sandwich from KFC the other day and i told them no pickles. Yet as soon as I bite there are pickles.
Yea_comma_ I really don't mind taking them off but still I thought I enunciated the request properly.
I got my associate's degree last year.  I had to get an A on my last final exam to get an A in my last class.
Nope!  I got a very sad B after three days of intense waiting.  LOL.
My wife and I took a two week vacation last year_comma_ and a friend of mine watched the house for us while we were away.
It did for the most part. The vacation itself was great_comma_ and my friend took good care of the house. The only thing that happened was on of the faucet handles on the bathroom sink broke while we were gone_comma_ but it wasn't my buddy's fault_comma_ it had needed replacing for awhile.
Hey i went ot the pound today.
Yea but i wanted all of them. They were all so cute and nice. I felt bad for them.
That'd be a lot of dog food
Same. If only we could just put them in abadoned malls or something.
My aunt was rushed to the hospital a few days ago. They are currently monitoring her condition.
Thanks for that_comma_ it's important to keep the faith I think. Medicine and our technology today is also advanced so I am hopeful.
A few years ago_comma_ when I was riding my bike home from work_comma_ I was struck by a van on my right side. My right lung fully collapsed and my left partially collapsed. It was a scary situation.
He did_comma_ it really wasn't anyone's fault in this situation. It was late at night_comma_ and snowing quite hard_comma_ so he just didn't see me. Luckily_comma_ I had insurance and I was out of the hospital in a few days.
Yeah_comma_ I was pretty lucky. I had a chest tube put in_comma_ and once my lungs were inflating normally again_comma_ I didn't really need any more treatment.
Yesterday was the first day of school for my kids.  It was also the first day of pre-k for my 4 year old.  He was supposed to ride the bus home_comma_ but when the bus got here_comma_ he wasn't on it!
Yes_comma_ I know.  I'm glad I had a car so that I could go pick him up_comma_ but it's so scary at first.  And then when I got to the school_comma_ having to wait for them to tell me where he was was so nerve wracking!
Yesterday_comma_ I saw a spider run right across my desk.  I screamed so loud.
I'm so scared of spiders_comma_ it's unbelievable.
What the hurricane did the Caribbean last year made me sad.
Yes_comma_ it was_comma_ I pray we don't getting any bad ones this year.
Last weekend my son came third in his jiu-jitsu competition
I was extremely happy for him and very proud as well.

Luckily no one in my house is as scared as I am
My brother called me to tell me he just bought a brand new car.
Yeah_comma_ me too. He got an infinity! It's so nice I wish I could have one of those!
Oh wow! LOL. I will be lookin for one soon I think.
last year i had put a nice chunk of change into crypto-currencies like bitcoin... although they went up in value a great deal_comma_ they have came back down before i actually took any profits. feels bad!
yea i used to try and make small trades for profits but its stressful_comma_ could drive me to relapse on drinking!!! i think im oging to just double down on what i have and buy more i think it should shoot up again eventually!
I woke up one night and realized that a roach crawled on my arm. I jumped up screaming before I killed it.
I hate roaches so much. I just want to put boric acid everywhere sometimes.
My son placed third in his jiu-jitsu competition. He surprised me with how well he did
It was only his second competition.  He did a lot better than I expected
I like to write and play music. I've been practicing a new song and I know I'm ready to play it on stage in front of people

Me too!
 I saw a cat get hit by a car this morning
No_comma_ unfortunately_comma_ because I was on my way to class and I was already driving so fast. I feel so bad for it. 
Thanks. It kind of started my day off on a bad note_comma_ but I'll get over it. 
When my wife and I went to New Zealand last year_comma_ we went swimming at a hot water beach. It was a really fun_comma_ interesting experience.
There are geothermal springs under the water at that particualr beach_comma_ and they slowly release hot water into the ocean. When the tide is high_comma_ the hot water is carried by the waves onto the shore_comma_ so you get this pleasantly warm water to swim in.
It's really hard to pick the coolest thing we did there. New Zealand is an amazing place_comma_ and there was so much to do. I'd highly recommend going if you get the chance.
She acted as though I am a magician and can do 12 things at once
My boss sorry im venting 
I was out shopping with my wife the other day_comma_ and I lost my wallet. It was so nerve racking to not know what happened to it.
I was very lucky_comma_ and an employee at the electronics store we had been to called me to tell me they had my wallet and I could come pick it up.
My boyfriend and I went through Hurricane Irma last year. It was pretty scary.
Me too! We got all the supplies we needed and put up the shutters ahead of time and sat it out. I'm glad we didn't need to use any of the supplies.
Yes_comma_ if I have to go through something like that I'd like him to be there.
The neighbor's dogs next door won't stop barking and let me sleep!
Yeah_comma_ they bark during the day too but I'm usually not home. I think I'm gonna talk to them today when I get home.
I hope so. I want to sleep peacefully! 
The last time my mom was in town_comma_ she brought some photo albums from my childhood and we spent a while paging through them.
Yeah_comma_ it was really fun.  Plus_comma_ I got to tease her about her Very Big 80s hair.
He seams fine when I talk with him but I know he is not. H has had a problem with substance abuse in the past 
Well My stepmom just died last week and I am concerned for him greatly 
My little brother is in high school_comma_ and he had a music performance at school last week. He's a guitar player_comma_ and when I saw him up there_comma_ I was so surprised by how good he's gotten!
I think he will_comma_ he seems to really love playing. I can't to see where he goes with his talent!
Sometimes I think my cat is just plain rude!
Very true. I just got done making my bed with brand new bed clothes. My cat had just eaten and was laying in the bed. She decided she wasn't feeling well and puked on my brand new comforter.
It's like_comma_ don't you know you don't puke where you sleep. Come on! lol
I found an old stuffed animal in my closet yesterday.
Yeah. A fluffy one. I made me think back to when I had a pet koala.
It was raining pretty hard the other day_comma_ and I normally walk to and from work_comma_ but my wife vey kindly decided to pick me up and give me a ride home that day.
She is. She works a few hours later than me normailly_comma_ so she had to go out of her way to pcik me up. I am a pretty lucky guy. :)
My daughter had an end of the year play at school and I was one happy dad
not really lol she was the cat and the fiddle. She doesnt like being the center of attention
I've been pet sitting for my mom while she's on vacation_comma_ and I've been alone in her house for a couple weeks now. It's tough being her by myself.
She has two cats_comma_ but they're both pretty shy. They've warmed up to me a bit_comma_ so that part is nice.
A car nearly hit me yesterday just because they wanted to change lanes while turning
I don't know. People drive horribly where I live. It's like a zoo every time I need to drive anywhere.
My primary care doc moved to a new office.  She's about half an hour further away from me_comma_ but I decided to stay with her anyway.
She's pretty great_comma_ I can't think of many people I'd drive that far to see haha
I'm feeling pretty lucky this month.
My boyfriend and I are having a 7 year anniversary this month!
We sat and talked last night about how we met. I'm totally blessed.
My mom told me the other day that they found out my grandma has Dementia_comma_ and is degrading pretty fast.
It's been hard on my mom and me_comma_ seeing her go downhill so fast. I still love her though_comma_ and see her whenever I can.
She's 86_comma_ and she still kind of remembers me_comma_ but thinks I'm still a teenager. She still loves talking to me though.
Hey! Yesterday_comma_ I signed for the gym near my house and an introductory personal training class with one of the trainers. Before leaving_comma_ I felt unsure if this was a good choice and what I should do. 
Oh yeah! I ended up going yesterday and it was a great time. I can't wait to go later today! 
I realized I got my birthday off from work and still payed for it!
My birthday is in december lol. But I just learned that today
Probably get drunk or something. I have to start early though
My dad is throwing a big party at his house. He want me to fly up to go to the party.

I found out I get my birthday off from work and still get paid!
no vacation just a free day!
You should watch this movie_comma_ I just watched it and it was really good_comma_ but also a bit emotional. . 
It was Christopher Robin! When I watched it_comma_ it was really heartfelt and wholesome. It made me thankful and grateful for everything in my life. 
One of my coworker's has been over 30 minutes late everyday for almost a month now. It's driving me crazy_comma_ and giving me so much more work to do.
Oh yeah_comma_ it's been bothering everyone_comma_ but he is a friend of the manager_comma_ so he won't fire him. At this point me and the other employees are planning on taking it to corporate to get this resolved.
Don't you hate it when you order food and you wait with anticipation. your food arrives and it's not what you ordered?
I ordered a pizza last night and realized they forgot to put the bacon on the pizza. I was not happy and it was too late in the night to do anything about it.
No_comma_ not yet but they will get a bad rating from me. who forgets bacon! LOL
I felt bad I missed my grandfathers funeral a while ago
I just didnt want to remember him like that you know
I received an excellent grade on an exam I studied really hard on
Thanks! Yeah_comma_ it's so satisfying and motivating. It makes me feel like I can accomplish anything as long as I put in the work!
I've been thinking about applying to this job that looks great_comma_ but I'm not sure if I'm qualified for it.
Yeah_comma_ I think I will. I'm still a little nervous_comma_ but it can't hurt to try.
I can't make decisions when buying things if there is too many choices
Yes! I get very anxious and tense about it. Shopping is my least favorite thing to do
I actually tried it last week and it was better because it kind of guides you what to buy
Don't you hate it when you find hair in your food?!
I know.  I went to this restaurant one time and when my food arrived I started to eat. That's when I noticed a piece of hair in my sandwich. I was totally grossed out and lost my appetite.
Yes_comma_ They gave me another order to take home.
While I was walking to class yesterday_comma_ I tripped over some loose bricks and fell down. The ground was wet from rain_comma_ so I was filthy when I got up.
Yeah_comma_ I unfortunately had to go to class that way.  I wasn't physically hurt_comma_ but my ego definitely was.
I was walking home from work_comma_ and I saw somebody put their used gum in a homeless man's cup!
Yeah I was shocked someone could be so callous. I went and bought the homeless guy a sandwich just to show him not everyone's a jerk.
I didn't sleep well last night_comma_ and then my son was being extra demanding of attention. I got upset with him_comma_ but realize he'd really done nothing wrong
I just felt so bad for getting upset with him.  
I've got a business meeting on Friday this week_comma_ and it's with a big client for my company_comma_ so I really need to make a good impression.
Yeah_comma_ I've got everything I need_comma_ and I've done my research on the people coming_comma_ so I think it will go well_comma_ but I need to keep on my toes.
Wednesday night_comma_ so luckily I get a day to relax and get ready before the meeting.
I wasn't raised in religious household but when I was a teenager I found god. 
I have found that it is to trust and accept events in life. 
Thank you it has been a revelation. 
I can't wait to finish my degree so I can become a nurse!
I imagine that it is an incredibly fulfilling and rewarding job. It's also a very needed job so I know that I'll always find a job somewhere.
I believe so! I know it's incredibly stressful_comma_ but it must feel great to directly make a positive impact on someones life. 
Last week my son went to visit family for a few days on his own.
He went to get spoiled by our cousins :)  But the house felt so empty without him.
I had a wisdom tooth bothering me and I knew what I had to do but didn't want to.
Yes_comma_ eventually but it took me quite a long time to get the nerve to even go to the dentist but I knew I had no choice.
Oh yeah. I'm so glad that's over.
I just got tickets to see my favorite band at Red Rocks Amphitheater. Seeing a show there is on my bucket list
A Perfect Circle.  I'm so excited the show date can't get here fast enough!
My son went to stay with family for a  few days all by himself.
I was happy for him_comma_ but I really did miss his hugs while he was gone.
I recently found old home videos of me as a child while cleaning out my living room cabinets
Yeah_comma_ they did. I saw a few videos of me singing at my talent show in elementary_comma_ and a few clips of me playing with my neighbors old dog! It almost made me cry!
Having a child changed my life. I never imagined I could be so protective of something. 
Yes you want to sheild them from everything bad and nurture them. 
My girlfriend has been messaging another guy from work a lot recently.
I can't help but feel like they are.  I have asked her about it_comma_ and she says they're just talking about work.  Maybe I'm just envious of the attention she's giving.
Our lawnmower is broken_comma_ and our neighbour offered to help us out by mowing our lawn.
He's been a great neighbour.  Very thankful that he's been able to help.
My son got his first ear infection last week.
Yes_comma_ thank goodness.  The antibiotics fixed him right up.
The doctor mentioned his congestion might have contributed_comma_ but I got the impression that they just happen sometimes with no real cause.
I've only been with my boyfriend for 2 years_comma_ but I can't think about anyone else but him. 
Definitely. We talk about marriage and children all the time_comma_ but we're still extremely young.
Thanks! I hope so too.
I had a bunch of surgeries this year. I"ve never felt more relaxed then when I found out I was clear and they were over with.

I have been going to the gym a lot lately and have lost a good bit of weight and toned up.
Thanks!  I went shopping over the weekend and got some new clothes.  I'm finally feeling good about myself again!
My daughter starts her first year of university in another city next week. I'll really miss her. 
Yeah_comma_ she took a year off in between college and high school_comma_ so I'm used to having her around. I'm anxious!
Only about 90 minutes. Living in residence will be a whole new world!
My dishwasher leaked and it damaged the floors and kitchen cupboards.
Thankfully it was covered by insurance_comma_ but it still got me upset to have to get our whole kitchen and living room redone.
My stepmother just died. I am very sad
No its not she was only in her 50s life is short 
I'm going on a trip to New York City in December.
No_comma_ I go yearly.  I already have my maps ready and color coordinated with things to do and restaurants to go to!
It's so much fun!  There is always something to do_comma_ even in the middle of the night_comma_ and the food is amazing
I used to watch Sailor Moon as a kid_comma_ and when they made a reboot_comma_ I got to share that with my daughters.
See_comma_ that what I'm talking about!  They were so into it!  I think I even shed a tear when Usagi made her first transformation.
I've tricked mine into learning_comma_ getting them to watch Cells at Work recently.
I was walking down our downtown club area one night a friend bumped into me and I tripped over a little fence. 
yeah took a hard fall. right on to my knees. No way to catch myself at all. 
My stepmother just died. I am very sad 
No not at all. Her Aorta ruptured suddenly 
 "I was ashamed once when I recieved a report card when I was young and I performed poorly. My parents trusted me to do well and I did not do well and slacked off.".
Yeah_comma_ but I did do better next time_comma_ so I am happy I learned from my mistake. I do occasionally get a bad grade in school. Lol.
"I was once given a watch and I got the opportunity to make a lot of money off it_comma_ but I kept it for it's emotional value.".
It was around $100 or so. In the end_comma_ the value to me was more than the money.
I did the final exams for my course last week_comma_ and I did so much studying and cramming_comma_ I'm sure I aced it.
Fingers crossed. Yeah_comma_ they were super hard_comma_ but when you have enough time to study_comma_ nothing's too hard.
When I was in the second grade my parents planned a trip to Disney World. 
I couldn't stop thinking about it. I would have trouble sleeping at night waiting for it.

Why Disney Land is like one quarter the size?
I took my car into get serviced and it ended up costing twice what I had budgeted. I'm going to be short again this month.
I'm not sure_comma_ I might have to ask my mom for a loan. 
Yes_comma_ but I really don't want to. I might try to sell a few electronics. 
It's back to school time. I am a teacher and I spent time getting my classroom ready today.

I hate mowing the lawn. I wish I had a riding mower. 
not large but large enough that it's a pain. 
When I was a brand new mom_comma_ I had to run to the store for pumping supplies and my son would not.  stop.  screaming.
I got so flustered_comma_ I just left the store and asked my mom to get the supplies for me. lol
I didn't want to bother her!
My best friend is finally able to come back to school after an academic suspension. 
She had failed too many classes.  We're in the same classes this semester_comma_ so that should help keep her on track.
Thanks!  I hope so as well.
I was in a meeting one time talking about a serious subject. The most mortifying thing happened!
I was making gestures while talking. I knocked a whole bottle of water all over my boss' desk!
No but it got all over all his papers. It also drenched his phone!
About 10 years ago my boss fired me out of nowhere. I was sick of making money for other people so I started my own business. 
I love set my own hours_comma_ do lots of different things_comma_ and make about the same I was making. 
I bought a bunch of dresses online to try on for my brother's wedding.
Not yet!  I really hope one of them works out.  I hate shopping in person haha
I saw the most terrifying movie a few weeks ago_comma_ called Hereditary. I was so scared! (Sorry hit send my accident)
It's about a very disturbed family. You need to see it! It's fantastic. Toni Collette is in it. 
Beware though_comma_ it's terrifying. Don't watch alone!
She ran her mouth to everyone.  I was surprised
Makes me so angry.  Especially when it is supposed to be a good friend
I reconciled once and then less than a year later she did it again.  I broke ties with her after that
Yeah my nephew and I were playing the other day in the house_comma_ he got into these old porcelain pug figurines my mom used to have out and at first when I saw he had them I was apprenhensive about letting him fool around with them. I decided to just see what he would do_comma_ and he did end up ramming them together like cars_comma_ but they didnt break and we both ended up happy.
No_comma_ she wouldn't mind if she saw they were fine though.
My daughter won an award at her school for best artist. I was so happy for her. 
She likes to work in oils but lately she's been doing sculture too. 
She's in grade 12_comma_ not sure if she'll persue it in university. 
Every year I get ready for hurricane season the day the season starts. 
yeah it has been for about two months and will be until November. We stock gas and extra water and food. 
I know a secret that could destroy my best friends marriage_comma_ but I don't know what to do.
Her husband is fooling around. 
Yeah_comma_ I'm just not sure how to break it to her. 
The other day i ordered a large group of books i've been wanting forever.
For fun. I'm very excited! 
My son is getting ready for his senior year in high school. I have mixed feelings about it!
Yes. I'm so excited for him_comma_ but also I am so nervous. I'm worried about getting through the application process_comma_ and also worried about him leaving home.
Oh_comma_ I hope you are right! Right now I'm losing more sleep than I should! 
Went to a friends getty the other week after a long opening to closing shift at work and had too many drinks and ended up peeing myself and blacking out!
Not at all. They were understanding and we had a good laugh about it. I did feel a little guilty about it though
My neighbor just bought a new apple computer.
Definitely.  I'm more a "buy the cheapest computer" type person_comma_ but I tried his out and it was really  nice.
It was a gorgeous morning today_comma_ the sun was shining as I walked my dogs and I'm still on summer holdiays. 
Just 2_comma_ little guys. They love thir walks!
Is it still summer holidays where you live?
Today! Yikes! Not till September 4th up here. 
My sister just got back from the trip of a lifetime_comma_ to Barcelona. She took her whole family_comma_ 4 kids.
They had a great time! I'm happy for her_comma_ but at the same time_comma_ I am feeling a lot of envy. You hit the nail on the head!
Yes! It's just hard realizing that I won't be taking any trips like that any time soon.  
Same here! Maybe someday!
A few weeks ago a lady at my job got a promotion i thought i was going to get.
It was really a tough one to swallow.
Nope. I think it was just favoritism to be honest. 
I found a research study for parents where you discuss and review an education website. It takes an hour of your time and you make $125. I applied and told my friedn about it so she could apply.
It was! Unfortunately for me she got chosen to participate and I did not. 
I can't stop thinking about my dog that died a year ago this week. 
It is so hard! I honestly mourned for so long. Sorry about your cat. 
Thanks_comma_ I am thinking of getting a puppy. It might help. 
Ohhhh I just love kittens! Lucky!
I have a job interview later today.
Not really_comma_ more of a job for the need of paying rent and all that. Times are rough for me after getting no cause fired at my last place.
Hey. I dated with my ex girlfriend for more than a year and i was never with another girl_comma_ not even once
It was actually. I was so in love with her that I almost ask her to marry me three months ago
She had to move from were we lived because of her mother. I still miss here and call her everyday and night
I hate the way people drive. 
It's not just smart phones. They seem to love riding in blind spots or under taking. Very dangerous things to do. 
I had been unemployed for a long time until earlier this year. I originally wasn't sure if I was going to even interview for the position I did_comma_ but I'm glad I decided to. I got a call in late may from a merchandising company. I went back and forth in my mind after being rejected from many interviews over the past couple years. In the end I went for it_comma_ the interviewer liked what I had to say_comma_ and I was hired the same day! I've been working there ever since.
Yeah I'm happy I kept at it :)
Good luck!
I was recently added to a team of people to work on a new project at my job.  I'm not really sure the goal of the project is a good idea_comma_ so I've been reluctant to really jump into the project fully.
I'm very pragmatic_comma_ and like to focus on the specific outcomes and logistics.  Everyone else on this team has more of a big-picture view and is concerned with how this will make our organization look good at a national scale.  It's a difference of priorities_comma_ I suppose.
Hey_comma_ how's it going? I was just thinking about my highschool days & I got really emotional.
Oh_comma_ it was a loooooong time ago_comma_ actually. I was just remembering all the good times when I was a cheerleader_comma_ all the games we won & lost & all the great friendships.

Online. I love it . It reminds me of sitting in front of the TV as my mom did housework.
My son got brought home by the police last week for spray painting an abandoned building. I was furious with him!
He was with a bunch of friends and everyone was doing it. He's grounded!
Yes_comma_ that was my recommendation. 
I tell my mother all of my secrets and I know she wouldn't tell anyone.
Yeah_comma_ I know! I have friends that are great but my mom seems to be the one person I can count on.
Me too. She's a great example.
Totally. I'm so grateful to have her. 
Years ago I had a friend who would tell me everything and told me she would always be there for me
No_comma_ unfortunately she changed a lot once we left school and we fell out
Yeah_comma_ it's just a shame that not many childhood friendships last_comma_ but I guess that's life.

Hey that's a good idea. I'll try that. 
I have to drive an hour longer to different school to take a math course I failed twice at my main university

I'm really starting to look forward to meeting my new students
I was so embarrassed at work last week.  My boss keeps bringing up a mistake I made months back.
I did though_comma_ I've apologized repeatedly.  we've discussed it multiple times.  It's hard because she brings it up in front of others. 
She doesn't really have one.  She's the PI and her technical supervisor won't do anything.  
No matter what other people say I always buy the newest Nintendo console.
I really like the Switch_comma_ I use the undocked thing all the time and play a quick game of mario kart or whatever before I hit the hay.

When I've finished all my work for the day_comma_ and I reward myself with Youtube and a nice comfy sit-down_comma_ I feel at peace with the world. Know what I mean?
'Contentment' was exactly the word I had on the tip of my tongue! I'm feeling like that now_comma_ actually. It's good to chat.
I feel like I've done so many wonderful things in my life. I'm just pleasantly peaceful.
I think if you try are satisfied with what you have in life. You can feel that level of relief and quiet joy one day too.
I just came home after totally embarrassing myself. My coat got stuck on a shop's product-display and the whole thing came crashing down! 
I'll move-on alright! I'll move towns! I'll never show my face in there again!

Same here. I'm trying to do everything I can to be supportive while trying to distract her from worrying. 
Some of my friends brag too much about the things they have. It makes me a little green sometimes.
I know_comma_ right? I work very hard_comma_ some of my friends have no idea what hard work is yet they have so much.
So_comma_ what happens next?
Where did you go? I missed something.
I used to be able to ride a bike and I enjoyed it_comma_ then I injured my leg. I miss that now.

I did. I also sent her flowers to try and make up for it. I felt so bad.

My mom recently figured out how to use a dual monitor set up at work! I told her I was proud of her.
She is. She's not very tech-savvy so I was shocked she figured it out! 
after all it wasn't a good experience
my friend knowing the truth
I threw away a lot of artwork that my kids did when they were little.
It seemed they mass produced art in preschool and elementary school.  They would come home with scribbled on paper_comma_ swirls of fingerpaint_comma_ things covered in construction paper.  It was ALOT
Well I did it secretly over the years.  I picked out some of my favorites and tucked them away in a box.  We just found them and it was fun to look at the stuff.
My wife is having twins soon. I am eager and scared of the delivery date.
In a few weeks. I'm beside myself with joy and worry.

My friend just told me they're going to tour Asia and I was so seethingly jealous I became really awkward. I just started talking super-formally and I didn't know what to really say.
Hey that's not a bad idea. I'd need to quit my job because they're going for ages_comma_ but it would certainly help me with my envy!
Thousands_comma_ I'd imagine. But I bet it would be worth it!
These days I feel like I got it all. I'm not rich by any means but I am enriched by a loving wife_comma_ children and a dog.

A few years ago I lost someone dear to me tragically. It broke my heart and left me feeling like I should have been able to stop it.
It's really hard. She killed herself. I feel like I failed her.
I'm eagerly awaiting another festive season_comma_especially the black friday".

When I was just a little kid my parents let my brother and I get a dog_comma_ and he was the best but unfortunately he passed away.
He lived over 10 years_comma_ and he was just a mixed breed. I was definitely very sad when he passed but we have a lot of great memories together.
Probably the worst time of my life was when my second marriage ended. It lasted over 20 years and much of my life and plans for the future were intricately bound within that relationship.

It took some doing and quite a bit of time_comma_ but the only thing you can do is endure and move on.

Our son in the Army is taking a leave to visit us next month.
Wow! So you can totally understand how I feel. You must be proud of your son as I am of mine.
Man_comma_ I let one of my friends take my Benz one day to run some errands. I really thought she would be careful with it.

He did.  He was always there for me as a kid so I knew I could trust him.

That's one more thing I know how to do. good for saving some money for sure.;
I was pretty nervous for my first date with my now girlfriend. I had previously been in a relationship for a long time_comma_ and it had been quite awhile since I'd been on a date.

When I was a kid_comma_ we used to make caramel apples every fall. They're such a wonderful treat.

my family threw a birthday party for me last year and they usually forget all about it_comma_ I could not believe it it really caught me off guard.
We used to be best friends but when she became president she started excluding me from everything
The president did. It's like the title went to her head and now she's super snotty.
Me too_comma_ I don't want to quit but I can't handle being treated poorly.
My son showed up at our door unexpectedly one day. He is in the Army and stationed in California!
Yes! I was so surprised! And happy
I planted vegetables in my garden. I can't wait until they sprout!
I planted tomatoes_comma_ peppers_comma_ and onions. I'm hoping to make salsa.
Once we were taking a drive and our dog got loose. He came home a few days later.
Yes! You know your pets are like family! We were so relieved to see him home!
I was feeling really down that he would be gone. He blew me away with this_comma_ never saw it coming.
Oh sorry_comma_ my husband blew me away. he sent me roses for my birthday!
No he doesn't. He was out of town working so I didn't expect it. But he knew I was upset to spend my birthday alone.
My husband gave me a really beautiful ring that belonged to his great grandmother. I cherish it every time I wear it. 
Yes. It means a lot to both to us. She was a very lovely lady. 
so this past sunday i cooked my first meal for my family. it turned out really good. 
seafood pasta_comma_ im so proud of myself. 
me too_comma_ i even made my own sauce
When I was a little girl_comma_ we had a house fire and it burned to the ground.
It came from next door. Someone knocked over a kerosene stove. 
Yes_comma_ it was scary but nobody was hurt. I am grateful for that.
I was at my mom's house doing some pet sitting for her recently_comma_ and I found an old family photo album. It was interesting going back through it and reminiscing.
I found some photos in there of my mom's house growing up. I had no idea she'd lived on a farm as a little kid_comma_ she never talked about it!
Oh gosh I just got in a wreck and totaled my brand new car!!!
I'm okay_comma_ shaken up but good. I don't know_comma_ we are still waiting on the investigation. But the other driver wasn't insured!
I didn't get the promotion I wanted_comma_ even though my boss said it was virtually guaranteed.
Nope!  I think he's avoiding me.  I went through three different interviews over two months and he was positive about it the whole time.
A close family friend died in a car accident recently. I had know him since I was a kid_comma_ so it was relly painful for me.
I'm feeling a bit better everyday. He was always really good to me and my mom growing up_comma_ so I still miss him.
My father died a few years ago_comma_ and I keep his cologne to remember him by.
Pretty much always_comma_ Jovan Musk _comma_it's an easy smell to remember. And makes me imagine him like it was yesterday.
Thanks _comma_ you have a great day_comma_ and keep your head up.
My boyfriend and I did a lot around the house last weekend. It was nice he didn't have to work. Come monday morning I knew I was really gonna miss him.
Yes he is. I'm glad he is so understanding about my clingyness. I don't work so I'm alone alot.
I am so behind on my housework. I have a pile of laundry that I've been neglecting...
Yes_comma_ I feel like a slob! I really need to get it under control!
I lived with this girl once and I trusted her. Found out I never should have.
I thought she was going through my stuff. So I set up a trap to find out for sure
That she was going through my stuff. I wrote a letter and place a piece of hair in it. Then had a guy write my name on it. When I checked hair was gone so I knew she had read it.
We were driving and suddenly our car stopped working in the middle of the freeway. It was shocking_comma_ and our hazard lights weren't working.
We were safe! Thankfully someone was able to tow us away quickly.
I'm so sad. My 15 year old cat just died. 
It was a Siamese cat. It's been a week and I can't stop crying. 
Yes_comma_ but I am not sure if I am ready or not. 
I went to the store yesterday to see if the bakery had fresh baked glazed doughnuts. 
They did! I actually got the last dozen.
Exactly what I did! Coffee and doughnuts :)
Only with my partner_comma_ he made the coffee lol
I went to the grocery store_comma_ while at the cashier i realized that I could not find my debit card.
No_comma_ I felt really bad. I ended up leaving the groceries.  
It is really sad_comma_ I had to call and order a new one.
I hope so too because it is so not good not been able to buy anything
I broke up with my girlfriend a week ago so now I'm adjusting to single life.
I agree_comma_ I'm taking it one day at a time and I realize that it will be a process.
When I was about 5 I saw my dog get run over by a tractor. The vet said we should think about putting him down because it could have brain damage. I threw a fit in the clinic when he said that. 
No Dobie was around when I graduated High School. That was one tough doberman. 
I had this really hard test at school the other day. I am pretty sure I aced it. 
Bio-engineering. It was really hard. 
My husband and I were really struggling to get pregnant. I was very upset about it.
I ended up having to go to the doctor because I was so freaked out. Eventually it just happened though and now she's 9 months old!
This morning_comma_ I went outside to harvest vegetables from my garden. I discovered that animals had gotten to them first_comma_ though.
I'm not sure what type of animal it was_comma_ exactly. Maybe we'll have better luck next year.
My boyfriend proposed last night!!
10 years lol!!!! Took him long enough hahaha
We bought a barn cat and he is super annoying. He always sits at the front door of our house instead of staying at the barn!
We just keep putting him back at the barn and making sure his food bowl is filled to hopefully entice him to stay.
I got invited to a party by some friends. I felt a little down because I got invited and I didn't try to get my brother an invitation.
Well_comma_ I just don't think they are as good of friends with my brother..but I think they should still include him.
I've been pet sitting for my mom while she is on vacation_comma_ and I've gotten close with one of her cats. She's just the sweetest little thing!
She is a Russian Blue_comma_ so she has this beautiful blue-grey fur. She is very friendly_comma_ and part of me wants to just take her home with me!
Maybe I could!
I was crashing on a boy once and he came to me to tell me he was in love with my best friend
Yes_comma_ it was cause I thought he like me cause we had went out once or twice
Yes_comma_ I did and have now been happily married for 10 years.
I feel so at ease and happy when my husband is home with me. I don't like being home alone
Yes_comma_ we do. He just makes me for so happy and satisfied. 
My wife bought us a super comfortable double recliner_comma_ and every since we got it_comma_ I never want to get out of it.
Yeah_comma_ untill we got the new recliner_comma_ I'd been sitting in a 20 year-old busted recliner and it was killing my back.
I just got to use my new coffee pot from a brand I've never tried. wow_comma_ that's good coffee!
Bonavita. I love it so much I will never buy another brand again.
got a great deal. check them out.
So a few nights ago I was awoken to a spider crawling across me in bed.
Nope! I kept feeling like they were all over me the rest of the night.
 once i got my favorite pen with me and i got full score.. is it not a lucky charm?
 i do accept _comma_ even then i believe in miracles!!
I went through some pretty tough times. Still_comma_ I believed things would get better eventually.
Absolutely. Things did get better as a matter of fact. 
i waited years and years but i finale did it
i got married
2 weeks and his name is matt
I think I'm gonna lose my doggie soon.
My dog is 10 years old. He has been pretty miserable with the ear infections and allergies. He just wants to sleep all the time.
Oh wow_comma_ thats a pretty healthy dog.
my first trip overseas was to Rome as a college freshman. that was many years ago. hope to go back soon.
It was a great trip. I was there for a semester. Small group of students living on campus about 10 miles outside of the city and easy public transport to get into and around Rome.
My wife and I are taking a vacation to Maine this fall_comma_ and I've never been before!
We are going to stay in Portland and explore it for a couple days_comma_ and we're probably going to do a lot of hiking so we can see all the beautiful scenery while we're there.
My most treasured item is her ornament that she had for her cat Barney.   That cat was her world. 
Its a porcelain one.   Barney was a black cat that lived into his 20s.  I loved that cat
Thank you.   
My Junior year in high school we made it to the state championship in football. The coach would let the captains say a few motivational words before we got off the bus. So he called me to say something. I told my teammates that if they didn't plan on winning the trophy don't get off the bus then I sat down.  
They were quiet it was supposed to be a two minute speech. The bus driver said you guys better listen he looks serious. 
WE won 60 - 3 
So I accidentally got someone fired for something at work.
The person bragged about doing something_comma_ that they didn't actually do. Which was highly inappropriate for the job we had. I had to tell the manager due to liability issues. All for it to not even be true.
I agree_comma_ but still feels bad to get someone fired at times.
i tell you i was red all over
i lost my swim trunks in front of a crowd
I was trying to use my smart tv to watch a movie and my internet kept disconnecting.
 I tried reconnectiong and it would work for a while and then disconnect again. it was a really good movie too!
what an odd memory to crop up. my dog jetted outside anytime he could and one night managed to get out and the car that hit him had no time to stop.. dark and right in front of our house. 
years ago I think I was in middle school at the time_comma_ he'd gotten out and met his fate when a car couldn't stop in time. It's an odd memory to pop up. maybe because i've just seen a bunch of pet posts from my friends on fb. 
it was. but of course you move on and at that age moving on isn't hard to do.
I went to a water park years ago. Aas I was going down one of the slides_comma_ my top slid up and I was exposed. I was so humiliated. 
Yes_comma_ but ever since then_comma_ i refuse to go down slides at the water park. 
I was working on this project for 6 years and the deadline was coming up. I knew we should have asked for 7 years of funding but my boss said 6 would be enough.
Not in time. The deadline came and I still needed about 3-6 more months. My boss said we should ask for an extension_comma_ but I knew those were rarely given.
He took part of it when he wrote a great letter backing the extension. But I was worried and felt like I should probably start looking for another job just in case.
Thanks! We ended up getting the extension so it all worked out.
So my daughter totally lied through her teeth right to my face yesterday.
Nope! School called me yesterday to inform me she never showed. I asked my daughter how her day was at school and she totally played it off like she was there the entire day. had no idea i was on to her.
oh yeah. She is grounded and now has to wear a uniform to school even though the school doesn't require it. LOL
Yep_comma_ thank you very much!
101 degrees this weekend. I would rather go out to a brewery. Instead I promised friends I'd help them move. SMH
ooo i like your way of thinking. 
if we're not dead wiped out from the heat of the day i'll have a beer for ya. if we are_comma_ i'll be drowning myself in ice cold water and we'll definitely drink more than a few of those for ya!
I still feel the loss of my 19 year old cat Lexi.  She was my first pet as an adult. 
Yeah it hurts but I felt lucky to have had her in my life.  Send your friends a hug from me.  
I am sooo excited! I just found out my husband is buying me a new car for my birthday! 
Yes! He's buying me a Dodge Charger Hellcat!!! Vrooooom!

i hate that my daughter is growing_comma_ she wanted me to drop off at the movies
yes_comma_ but the world is so scary
i agree
I just knew my daughter could pull it off!
She  is normally a D student but worked really hard and got the A B honor roll!
Yeah and I'm glad she realizes there is nothing wrong with her. It just takes a little effort.
I have been happy married for 10 years.
Yes_comma_ we do. I can't wait to see what the next 10 years bring
just moved into a new apartment last weekend. pretty happy with it. a little smaller but a 5 yo complex as opposed to a 45 year old complex. modern amenities are nice. also_comma_ i'm going to visit my family tomorrow. good week so far.
yeah. so i live in austin but moved up to the cedar park suburb.. about 15 minutes north of my old place. cedar park itself is not new but it has started growing because people can't afford the quickly rising prices in austin proper.
Hey_comma_ what's up?

My mom borrowed my car last week. I wasn't worried.
Definitely. But i'm not concerned about her!
My very first boyfriend ever cheated on me. When I found out I was so mad. 
Oh wow. Yeah_comma_ I can't even imagine if I had married him. I'm glad he showed his true colors early on. I never had to see him again after that.
beautiful friend of mine. i had gone to visit and walked in a room i normally put my coat when i get to her house and she was in various states of undress. i don't think you've ever seen anyone turn around and get out of a room so quickly.
very much so. we laugh about it now years later but yeah talk about turning 5 shades of red quickly!
indeed haha!
i want it to rail today
yes_comma_ sorry rain
its been so hot and dry here

A close friend of mine recently told me he was filing for divorce. I've known him and his wife for decades_comma_ so I'm concerned for them both.
Yes. Unfortunately_comma_ they have kids as well. 
Yes. They're in their early teens_comma_ or near it. 
I remember my mom taking be to my dorm to check in for college. I was excited and nervous at the same time. 
That's what I was excited about. Independence and starting something new. 
I was babysitting a few days ago and my cousin kept throwing her food on the floor.
I kept cleaning it up and put down a bunch of towels around her to protect the floor. I think it comes with the territory_comma_ she gets what she wants.
my close friend stole from me_comma_ im upset!
no_comma_ but i want to. i seen her on my home camea
i dont know_comma_ this isnt the first time. 
A few years ago I was able to buy my first new Car. That was such a great day.
I got a Dodge Caravan so I could do my garage sale thing. It held everything I bought that day with room to spare. always had used cars.
Thanks! still loving my new van.
I was rear ended last Friday while sitting at a stop light. 
Yes I have the info. I just left the adjuster a message before I started talking to you. 
Thank you so much
I just finished eating a fantastic meat loaf. I've been cooking a lot lately and am pleased with my results. 
I found a real tasty ketchup_comma_ lower in carbs and sweetened with honey_comma_ so I've been using that as a topping.
It keeps my blood sugar from spiking. 
i went to a local restaurant _comma_ but the gloves that they wore touch everything including my food. ugh
yes!
neither do I_comma_ but i seen it with my own eyes. 
I think someone stole my headphones recently.
Not exactly_comma_ I have many friends and acquaintances in my dorm on the regular_comma_ so I'm not sure who it could be.
Man_comma_ my best friend just got a Lamborghini! I am so envious of her. I've always wanted one. 
Yes_comma_ hopefully someday I can have one. At least she was nice and gave me a ride in it. 
growing up my mom played a lot of Aretha Franklin. Naturally when I heard she passed I was shocked.
Yes_comma_ I have a special place in my heart for classic music. 
I was watching Aretha Franklin videos this weekend and it made me think about being young and my mom listening to her albums. 
That made me smile. My mom and your mom are soul sisters. 
One birthday I could not believe my eyes!
One year for my birthday I had gone to my moms for a visit by myself without my fiance. When I got home and walked the door I was greeted by a golden retriever puppy!
I know! I named him Jake. He is laying next to me by my feet.
I'm listening to this audiobook and it's so scary_comma_ I could cry
it's really scary though... I think I will quit
I will always remember the day I found out I was pregnant with my first child. I was so happy and hurried out to get a card and gift for my husband to surprise him.
He was very excited! We were nervous when we first decided we wanted to have one_comma_ but we immediately were thrilled when we found out.
i was on pins in needles waiting for the arrival of my first born
yes_comma_ extremely better

I checked the mail box one day and had a letter from a University I wanted to go to. 
Texas Christian University TCU. But the stealing thing is going catch up to you. 
The only thing christian about TCU is the name. I'm on scholarship. 
I was dating someone else when I met the man who is now my husband. I thought he was just going to be a friend_comma_ but I eventually developed feelings for him.
He didn't_comma_ but when I broke up with him I let him know. I never acted on my feelings until we were broken up.
 I think my daughters boyfriend is so respectful. I really like him.
Me too. He asked me if it would be ok to asked her out on a real date. He is taking her to dinner and a movie Friday.
Not too nervous. I really think he's a good guy.
I'm supposed to visit my sister's family for thanksgiving this year_comma_ but I'm not really looking forward to it. We haven't gotten along over the past several years.
Maybe. She has a lot of mental difficulties that makes it hard to be around her. Short visits are okay_comma_ but anything longer than that gets uncomfortable. 
I feel like things are falling into place with my life
Just with my career_comma_ relationships and family. I was a little lost there for awhile. 
My son recently came home from his grandparents and had a gift for me. I was so excited!
He had helped his grandpa make me a planter box and had filled it with soil and seeds for different herbs.
i was outside watering my flowers and seen a snake
took off as fast as i could
a big one. lol
right_comma_ i dont know where it went
I was going on a vacation_comma_ so I made sure to pack everything that I would need.
I agree. I made all of the reservations I would need far in advance.
Thank you! I checked the weather_comma_ and it's supposed to be great!
My husband is installing a wood boiler for our home to heat our house this Winter. I'm so impressed with him because he's doing it all on his own.
Very! He surprises me every day with the amount of knowledge he has. He can fix anything!
I recently got a $50 gift card that I'm really looking forward to using.
I'm looking at some D&D/RPG stuff. Maybe the Avengers Infinity War Blu Ray. 
I am eagrly awaiting fevershly
naw i cant wait
I was recently promoted at work_comma_ I was a bit surprise but happy.
No_comma_ they called me into the office_comma_ told me to have a seat and said that I have been promoted.
Oh yes! I put in long hours an d lots of hard work.
I was talking to my mom one day and she was telling me that my step dad was having some heart issues. He was in the middle of a big garden project and could not finish.
They ran some tests and could not pin point what was wrong so he is just taken it easy. I decided to take a weekend and go over and finish the garden. He was pretty happy about that.
Yep_comma_ now all he has to do is water it.
I'm a huge football fan but wasn't happy about last season. 
That's the reason I was mad about the season. Who is your favorite team?
Dallas 
I like Chicago too. 
My sister took my best friend to the movie instead of me_comma_ I was really sad. 
She was upset with me so to get back at me she did that.
I try to make peace with her but she is always angry so I let it be.
i lost my sisters dog
no_comma_ looked everywhere
yes_comma_ hopefully he can find his way back home
I got bar-b-que from a place a few weeks ago and it literally tasted like the got it out of a dumpster. 
I have no idea but it was the worst taste ever. It tasted rotten. 
Someone knocked on my door the other day. I peaked around the corner so they could not see me. 
 I don't know anyone and was alone so I wasn't sure if I should answer the door. Things are getting pretty scary in the world.
I don't know. I never answered it but it was a man and not in anykind of work uniform.
i walked in there and strutted my stuff like a peacock
job interview
When I was 17_comma_ I held a neighbor's baby and she puked alllll over me.
Yeah_comma_ it wouldn't really phase me now but at the time it was a crisis haha
it's annoying isn't it? You're expecting a check or something else to be delivered to you based on what you were told and yet it looks like that schedule won't be adhered to. That's where I was a few weeks ago.
the darned thing arrived while i was out of town. 
glass half full. i like it!
Had my daughter over a couple weekends ago. She had brought a scrapbook she put together herself of us.
She is 19. I thought that was so nice of her. We had a nice time looking through the pics and talking about the good ole days.
I know. Love her to death.

I felt so bad. He was quite upset about it.
I attended a Tony Bennett concert in April. It was amazing!
Yes_comma_ he is 92! He still sounds great though. Have you heard his music before?
So I was walking my dogs today and I tripped over Boomer's feet! As if that wasn't bad enough I was in front of the school and everyone saw me fall that was dropping off their kids

Don't you just love buying brand new sheets?
Yeah me too. yesterday I made the bed with new sheets and comforter. Last night I was pretty tired and decided to try out the new bed and watch my shows. Omg_comma_ those sheets were so comfortable I fell asleep in the middle of my show
1800
Thanks! lol
I took my final exams and I am awaiting the results. I pray that I will pass with a good grade.
I think I did pretty well but still a bit worried.
Yes_comma_ they were very hard I think I didn't study enough.
I applied for a job once that I really wanted. I can remember nervously waiting for a call back. 
Yes_comma_ they called me back like a week later. 
Don't you hate it when you swimming with someone who's got a big bugger hanging out of their nose?
once in my early twenties I remember going to a party and everyone was in the pool. I got in the pool and splashed around and didn't realize I had a huge green bugger coming out of my nose. A really cute guy pointed that out for me
Omg. my face was so red it was purple!
A few years ago_comma_ when I was first out on my own_comma_ my car got broken into.
Yes_comma_ unfortunately. I had just gotten some big speakers installed_comma_ and those were taken. Also_comma_ two cases of c.d.s were gone.
Yes_comma_ and they were caught! Thankfully_comma_ I got my belongings back!

I was very nervous. Yes I took the test and I passed it.
Yes I am a happy driver_comma_ I will be definitely taking my time.
I have this huge presentation at work tomorrow and if the investors like my idea I can land 3 big accounts for my company.
Yes_comma_ I am so nervous. I have no idea what to wear and I'm scared I won't sleep tonight at all.
I have a feeling I'll be counting lots of sheep tonight.
it's monsoon season here where i live and I can hear the thunder rumbling_comma_ I hope we don't get flooded. I'm pretty scared.
yeah we have rain all week i'm not okay with that
I recently decided to start blogging again and feel pretty good about it. I used to have a decent sized audience_comma_ so hopefully I can build it back up.
Old school tabletop RPG's. The blogging scene is still fairly active so getting back involved with the network should be easy. 
I parked my car at the Walmart parking lot and someone used a car to hit my car.
I was not hurt but my car got a scratch and a few dents.
That is so true. I am thankful for that.
My husband might get transferred to a new position and that means we might get to move closer to family.
so true_comma_ I miss them. I'm really thinking he'll get it.
i once got lost in a big city with no cell battery_comma_ scary

I'm working on a new Dungeons & Dragons campaign for my players and have been busy in my spare time getting everything ready.
I usually run games on Sunday's but it'll be another month or so before we start. 
Goodness_comma_ I was working the concession stand at Emma's ball game. I bent over to grab a box of crackers and split my pants open!!!
Well of course_comma_ there was a whole line of fans getting snacks.. I grabbed a coat and tied it around my waist.
No doubt about it_comma_ next time I'm wearing an extra pair of pants!
When I go to a bar with my girlfriends and a guy offers to buy me a drink_comma_ I always decline because I have a boyfriend. I wouldn't want to lead anyone on and have them spend money on me!
True lol but I feel sooo guilty and I don't want anyone to have expectations that I am definitely not going to meet
So my kid starts preschool in a week.
I will probably cry then celebrate. I'm excited but a little sad at once. 
A few days ago_comma_ I was looking through a bunch of old photo albums.
Just for fun. It brought back a lot of good memories!
All of the above_comma_ including many of a friend who passed away a year ago. 
Last year our football team managed to win the league despite being underdogs the entire season!
We were elated_comma_ it was such a proud moment for us all as we worked so hard throughout the season.
I remember the day that I met my husband. A friend introduced him and he was very shy.
That was four years ago_comma_ he is still shy but he is a wonderful husband.
Yes_comma_ that is so true

Well when I was younger I began experimenting with something some may call taboo or even wrong. I was in my mom's bedroom one day and came across some of her clothes ...
LOL! Great guess! Yes I experimented a bit. Unfortunately it creates tension with my current relationship. 
If I am being honest_comma_ I was bummed when my brother got a full ride to college.

Last summer I stayed with a friend as I was nearly broke.  I went the store to get food and got back $20 extra in change from the cashier and ended up keeping the money.
Yeah so her drawer was short. I realized it later not while she gave me the change so that helped me justify keeping it.

My friend from highschool jsut told me she is moving back to town!

You'll never believe what happened tonight.
I was walking to my car in the parking deck and a guy was breaking into the cars.

This lady at the store kept flirting with me today

At a party I found myself to be by myself
Yes_comma_ but I didn't really fit in with the crowd..I couldn't connect with them on anything.
I feel really calm_comma_ stable and happy right now . Life is running smooth and I am enjoying it.
Honestly its just that work is smooth and no issues with home life or family right now. Life is seldom smooth so I am relaxed and enjoying it while it lasts.
I offered to take care of my friend's dog while she was on vacation
Thanks! It was my first time taking care of a dog! I've never even had a pet before so it was something new
That's true! It was very easy. I had a great time with her dog. Now I want my own. Haha!
So my girlfriend is meeting up with a boyfriend she has when she was 16

"I had 2 job interviews yesterday and my nerves are on edge today.".
I think they went well. Im keeping my fingers crossed.
I hate when you're with someone else in public_comma_ and they're super rude to the waiter or salesperson or whomever. 
Especially if they're being irrational. I worked in retail for a long time so I sympathize with others in that position.
Last winter I went to the local pharmacy to get flu meds and threw up while waiting in line. I was mortified and ashamed.
I was just starting to feel bad and did not expect that to happen. I t just happened and I did not want to look at anyone or make eye contact. I wanted to crawl under the counter and hide.
So i had to go to court but i had all my papers ready and proved my case
it was a parking ticket dispute but it was not my fault and they ruled in my favor
A few weeks ago my dog died. I was depressed to see him go.
Well we haven't decided to look for a new dog yet. I think I need some time to reflect.
I feel very satisfied with life right now. My friends and family are healthy_comma_ and I am doing good in my classes
Thanks! I hope everything continues to go well. There's always some bumps along the road_comma_ but hey_comma_ what can you do about it? 
Yeah. I think you can use those struggles as a way of learning through your mistakes.
My car stalled when I was at a store not long ago.
It was nothing too bad.  A man helped me get it started so I could at least get it home.
The hurrican that came through completely destoryed my house
We have a home to live in but we lost everything
I was looking at some new cars. but the salesman was really pushy
Im not sure I just needed someting realible you know?
When I got home from work_comma_ I realized I had my shirt inside out the entire day
I hope not. I don't think anyone did or my coworkers would've told me.. but who knows if someone was just laughing behind my back?!
I have been through a lot but now i think im at a good place in my life
Im not sure i think i have just learned a lot about myself
I thought I was going to crash my car last week. A guy cut me off.
Well we just passed each other on the road. I should have honked my horn though because I was upset.
Im excited my birthday is coming up and i know my wife is getting me something good
Yeah i think she is getting my a new chair!
I remember going to college out of state and being scared of the unknown since I would be so far away from familiar surrounding.
Yes_comma_ I learned so much from the experience.  I made friends quickly and that helped so much.
My son and his wife are expecting their first child this fall. I am so excited and looking forward to being a grandmother.
Thanks_comma_ the excitement of looking forward to the birth is so strong. The build up is growing each day_comma_

Last month_comma_ my family and I drove to Colorado to visit my sister.
Not very long because she came to visit us about 3 weeks before we went there. The trip was fun_comma_ but the driving always scares me.
It was a bit over seven hours_comma_ and the traffic was crazy for about 2 of those hours.
so i did not get the promotion at work. they selected Steve to get it
I am just I will get it next time
Thanks! Please wait while we match you up with another worker. (Sometimes this takes a few minutes if there aren't many other workers available
I feel so thankful for having such an accepting family. I recently came out and everyone was beyond supportive.
A scammer called me on the phone today_comma_ he tried to get me to sign up for a service.
Well this isn't the first time he's called. I was irritated_comma_ he won't leave me alone!
I felt nostalgic the other day when I found a photo of my pet who died some time ago.
It's nice and brings back good memories.  I still miss my pet.

I am up for a promotion at work. There are three other people up for it too but I am sure I will get it
General Manager and I positive I will get it. I do the best work out of the group. I have more experience as well
I do and I have the best attitude out of all the candidates. I feel certain I will get the job_comma_
I feel kind of blue today.
It's too quiet around here.  I miss all the kids being around since my son moved out.
I'm sure they will.  Maybe I should record them and then I can play it real loud.  Imagine he's still here.
My friend just told me their secret
Yes_comma_  a really juicy one
Nah_comma_ I promised not to tell it to anyone
Nothing is going my way today.  
I put a lot of effort into bidding a really nice project.
They gave it to someone else.  I was counting on winning it.  I don't know where I went wrong.
I needed someone to watch my dogs last week
Yeah_comma_ my friend volunteered to do it for free!
When I was a child_comma_ my Mother and I took care of a garden allotment. I always think back on that time fondly_comma_ it was the best time of my life.

So I flirted with a married woman yesterday
She was very upset. I did not even realize she was married.
I feel really lucky even though I don't have much.
I came across a homeless person today and talked to him for a while.
Thanks.  I gave him some food and money.  You just never know.  Anything can happen.
Man i hate when family dies..:(
Yes_comma_ it seems my elders are on their last legs and i just lost my father.
It gives me a perspective i've never had.
I hope to save up enough money to run my own guest-house one day. I daydream about it all the time.
Oh_comma_ it would be rented out to earn an income - it would be my job. I think I'd let friends and family stay for free if it was vacant.
I felt like i can't buy a car.
No the salesman won't gie me a reasonable price.
It seemed like i couldn't find anyone who wouldn't realize i knew the reasonable price for any car.
I saw another woman looking at my boyfriend up and down while we are in line at the store
I don't think so. She didn't even make eye contact with me. But at least my boyfriend didn't seem to notice. We were holding hands_comma_ so I assume she knew we were together!
That's a good way to look at it. But I know he's good looking_comma_ he's mine! Haha! 
I went to the pound today and i felt like taking every animal home.
How do you deal with it? I just want them all!

You are so right!
Yes_comma_ I did. Its much larger_comma_ and my children attend school on the same street.. its about a mile long
I can't believe my younger brother makes more money than i do.

Thats a smart idea! Thank you! I should try to combine forces...haha
Im taking your advice and putting it into practice tomorrow!
When I got back from vacation_comma_ most of my garden was dead. My roommate promised me she would water it!
I hope so too. I was just so mad... All the work I put into my garden was destroyed. Now_comma_ I just need patience

I'm pretty tech savvy_comma_ it's just the more on work on that the more actual work I need to do doesn't get done_comma_ you know?
I had a great time this weekend.
We took a trip to the mountains to hike.  So nice to be away from the city outside in nature.

We rode in the cab_comma_ and my friend looks at me with the most serious face and tells me they are Bi-Sexual. Though they said they usually only date the same sex and they hadn't ever told anyone about it.

I used to work as a flooring specialist at a major chain home improvement store. It was a good place to work until I got a new supervisor who thought he could disrespect me without consequences.
We got into several arguments and management decided to ignore  the problem and hope it would blow over. After a few weeks I turned in my resignation. 
I had my own issues at work.  I was gossiping at work the other day with a coworker of mine.

Not really but she was rude the last time I saw her.  I just got in my car and drove away.  I feel so bad now though for not just waving hi.
My grocery delivery was 2 hours late. They said they'd give me one discount but gave me two. I should probably tell them but I'm keeping them.

I lent my friend a thousand dollars recently.

All day at work my coworkers would laugh when I'd pass by. I had no idea what was going on until I got home and noticed I had a giant candy stuck in the back of my hair!
I'm thinking my three year old probably left it on my pillow last night! He has an issue with not throwing away his candies into the trash. And yes_comma_ I'm I wish someone had told me! Now I dread going back to work.
Thanks for the kind words! I'll definitely go in tomorrow and pretend it didn't happen. Only way to move forward.

Trees down but nothing too bad. I just don't like thunderstorms
I got to visit with some of my old high school friends a few weeks ago. It's hard to believe it's been over thirty years since we first met.
Yeah_comma_ there's only one of them I really keep up with. I'll probably never see the other two again. 
My puppy fell off the couch and hurt his paw.
He is fine now_comma_ but I took a couple of days off of work to nurse him back to health.  Poor little thing.
He is a baby Australian Shepherd.  Just a sweet little thing.
I was very concerned.  We went to the vet and she said it was probably just a sprain.  Better safe than sorry_comma_ though.
I had a hard time choosing which phone to get. I ended up getting a new phone with all the specs.

I just got an email today that my dream college just rescinded my admission offer.
I think so_comma_ but I still feel physically sick because of the devastation. I feel like I have no idea what I am going to do now
My cats for the most part are angels_comma_ but they've absolutely destroyed a very nice sofa bed my grandmother left me when she passed.
This is the first time ever they've done this so I am so baffled. I'll tell you what_comma_ this thing is totally shredded.
It's ok. At first I was livid and sad because of the sentimental value but now I just have to cover it all up I guess.
Thanks for the well wishing though_comma_ I appreciate it.
Have you ever gone to an open mic night?
I love them. I just practiced my new song and I am ready to share it on stage.
Thanks! I think it's one of my best work.
I feel so bad about breaking my moms picture display_comma_ it was very elaborate and nice
No_comma_ it took a lot of work and special photographs
My sister let me take care of her dog whilst she was away. I really enjoyed taking care of him.
Its a Labrador. I cared for him so well i think I spoiled him a bit with all the treats!
I wrote a 20 page paper for a class. I walked away from the computer for a second and when I returned I had lost all of my work.
That was the only copy. I had to start from scratch.
Last week I put in a bid to purchase my first home!
I haven't heard yet. I would really like to get it_comma_ but I have to wait to see.
I take my family to the local soup kitchen to volunteer a couple saturdays a month and we really enjoy helping.
The people there are teaching all of us so much.  I hope so. I want them to not be afraid to show kindness to people.
For the first time in my life I am financially secure_comma_ have my own home_comma_ and a new car. 
Yes I feel content that I am in the right place. I hope it only gets better from here.

I already have all that_comma_ but three seems to be just perfect.  I love these little ones.
I let my Tesla drive on autopilot for four miles yesterday!
Yea I felt I have enough faith in the car to drive properly and not cause any accident1

Unfortunately not. I know it is going to cost a lot to fix it. 
Yes it does_comma_ it totally ruin my day.
I am so ready for my test. I studied for 5 hours striaght. 
Thank you. It's Psychology.

When we moved_comma_ my grandfather gave me a lamp as a gift.  He attached a cut out of a spider to the inside of the shade.
I screamed bloody murder when I saw it lol
My husband was sick with a really bad cold a few weeks ago. I tended to him to make him comfortable while he got better. 
LOL!!! Yup! But seriously_comma_ I was happy to do it for him. He always does the same for me when I am sick. 
I had always thought I could have faith in my mom to help me out when things when tough but I was wrong.
I just needed assistance to get out of the bad situation I was in and she basically told me I was on my own after telling me for years If I ever wanted to get out_comma_ she'd help me.
She's very unreliable so I'm not holding my breath!
I lost my mother recently_comma_ she was sick with hypertension and diabetics
I can't get over it_comma_ I cry all the time.
I try to treasure the memories that we have. I keep close to family members as well.
Yes family helps me a lot and my father is still alive.
I am really excited about this weekend!
I am going to spend some quality time with my family. How about you?
I think that is what we will be doing mostly_comma_ but they are normally gone all week and I am alone so it is nice when I get to see them.
Several years ago I got to be on a game show! I hoped to win a lot of money.
Jeopardy. I had a lot of fun_comma_ but unfortunately I lost and only got a small consolation prize.
In retrospect it was_comma_ but at the time I wasn't very happy.
My 10 year old cat is starting to get sick a lot. I'm worried about her.
Nope_comma_ she's been very healthy. She's just getting old.
My brother is watching over some possessions of mine while I leave for a trip. There's some expensive exercise equipment he has to look after.
I am kind of sweating bullets over the decision_comma_ to put it mildly he is very flighty.
Thank you! Maybe it will all work out_comma_ let's hope.
Yesterday I was not at all patient with my little brother.
I was helping him with his homework and he didn't understand. I yelled at him and I shouldn't have.
I got one thousand dollars from my father for my birthday.
I have not figured it out as yet 
I will my dear I will be spending it wisely.
I still remember when I used to wait tables back in college and dropped the plates when serving an important patron. 
It was. I was left red faced and got fired the week after.
I was ashamed when I broke my moms vase.
It was one her mother gave her_comma_ I was playing beyblades and I broke it.
I know but it still shouldn't have happened.
I have a job interview coming up! I'm nervous_comma_ but I think I'm ready!
I've studied the company's history_comma_ CEO and mission statement! Anything else you think I should know before I go in there?
With all the climate change happening in the word_comma_ I don't know what's going to happen where I live_comma_ specially since i live near the coast
Exactly or even before that!   Are yo planning to move?
I have a wonderful family and my health that has been horrible_comma_ is finally turning around with my hard work. I am happy with life.
Thank you. I am glad too since its been 13 years of suffering.  I can't really be upset about anything in life so just enjoying it.
My sister fell ill a few weeks ago. I went to her house to take care of her.
She is doing much better now. You always have to look out for family.
Earlier a phd student posted he wanted to talk to someone on a fb online forum _comma_ i did he sounded like a nice kid _comma_ he promised to pay me _comma_ i trusted him
its good that i trusted him it was like a 5 minute call_comma_ and he promised me some money i checked and the money was already in there 5.00 dollars
These days I'm trusting my intuition and following my gut to achieve my goals.  They've gotten me this far and haven't let me down yet
Yup fully self-employed paying my own bills and own my own car...finally feel like an adult_comma_ bout damn time
We had a group meeting at work and there was some leftover pizza. While everyone was getting ready to leave and they weren't looking_comma_ I snuck the rest of the leftover pizza in my purse and slid out!
It was not bad.. from a local place. New York style_comma_ which is my favorite. I'm sure they didn't really care in the grand scheme of things.. I just hadn't eaten all day and still felt like a hungry pig even after we had some during the meeting. Someone mentioned they wanted to take the leftovers home to their spouse too_comma_ so that made me feel a little bad
So_comma_ is it wrong to not want your child to join a sport because you just don't want to have to take them to practices?
That sounds awful! I feel a bit ashamed_comma_ but I really just want to talk him out of doing it.
Thanks! That makes me feel a lot better.
I recently visited my hometown after being away for 20 years!
It was so nice seeing my old house_comma_ school and the woods we used to play in. I really miss that area!
I was really late to work the other day_comma_ and my car was running on fumes.
Yeah I just knew my gas was going to run out before I got there.
My neighbors left their trash in the hallways. It is attracting flies.
Yeah_comma_ it is really gross. We only have to get it out of the door anyway.
I was doing a presentation at work and in the middle of it my computer crashed! I couldnt believe it!
It did! And no i had to stop and restart because it was vital to my presentation.
Yea after 10 grueling minutes. 
One of my friends was telling me to not include my best friend in a movie night. I told her if I couldn't invite her then I wasn't going to go either.
I can't stand when people do that without good reason.  I try to be because people deserve that.
me and my mom have been feeling blue _comma_ ever since my brother moved far away
time to start a new life _comma_ it was about that time_comma_ but it still hurts us as a family
I accidentally broke a vase at my moms house on sunday.
I haven't told her yet_comma_ she didn't notice.
I think i'm gonna just have to come clean about it.
I went back to my old neighborhood to see friends and it was a crazy feeling.
A good one. I missed the old days.
Yes not realizing how cruel humanity is was very peaceful.
Yup! I don't want my children to lose that anytime soon.
I just started working out again after almost 20 years and I was very nervous at first.
It went good. Everything came back to me pretty easily.
I was working out not working.
I definitely feel better on days that I go.
August is coming to an end. I always go back to my childhood when the last week before school starts were some of the most exciting times of my young life.
A lot of horsing around usually_comma_ but many adventures at what seemed like a far distance away from home. I always choke up thinking about it.
Times were so much more simpler back then.
We had a couple go karts that we'd zip around in the neighborhood then. We felt like kings of the town.
Just avoided cheating on my girlfriend.
i was at a party and this girl came up to me and tried to kiss me_comma_ I had to say no. I'm a faithful man.
I am I have too_comma_ she deserves to know.
We just got a new rabbit as a pet!
It's fun_comma_ but also a bit yucky. He isn't litter trained yet and has made a mess of the carpets.
"Last weekend_comma_ I slipped on some wet grass and slid_comma_ hand first_comma_ into a pile of dog poop. In front of everyone at a BBQ.
It was so awful and disgusting.  I actually just left because I was so grossed out that I wanted to go home and take a shower.
I don't have much more money to keep living as a college student. But I just have one more year left. After that_comma_ hopefully things stabilize.
Thanks! I appreciate that. I actually am getting a degree in social work. At the moment_comma_ I'm just trying not to become the needy/helpless demographic I seek to serve in a career after I graduate
Is it wrong to be jealous of your best friend?
That's true. She just sold her book to a publisher and it is just a little weird. 
Thank you for saying that. It really makes me feel better.
So I've been having a problem lately.
I've been seeing a doctor for it.  I've had to go through a lot of testing lately.
Kind of have to.  I have pelvic floor damage from childbirth.  I'm hoping the doctor knows what they're doing.
My dad got my brother a watch but not me.
Yes_comma_ and I feel kind of envious of my brother now.
It's friday. I'm going to go home and grill a steak and have a beer.
I know right.  It's a free country.... murica'
I'll have two for you.
I stepped into my Ferrari F-40 the other day_comma_ and I shed a tear.
LOL_comma_ no.  But I can still remember watching my beloved late grandfather stroking the 1.3 million dollar check.  I was very fond of him.
My neighbor asked me out on a date_comma_ even  though he knows I am married. I told him no.
He was annoyed and was insisting.
Yes I did_comma_ My husband was not pleased.
It was quite an experience flying for the  first time.
I was kind of scared but I put my trust in to the pilot to get me safely to Montreal for a festival.
Every single person I know got to go on a vacation this year except for me. 
I just don't have the funds or time away from work. Even my sister and her husband_comma_ who are as broke as me_comma_ went on one.
Seeing my garage burn was insane.
We did but it was some scary_comma_ the flames were massive.
I accidentally left the screen door cracked open and my beagle got out. 
Luckily the neighbor we know caught him before he got too far away.  Thank goodness_comma_ he's not great with strangers.
I read an article the other day about a noble politician. he gave his salary to charity!
I know right! I expect others to take notice and follow on this honorable path.
I believe he is. He doesn't take capmaign contributions from corporations.
I want to try sushi at some point soon.
I'm afraid of getting sick though.
I love my mom shes really nice and helpful
when you're sad nobody beats ma!
A friend of mine got first place in her age category in a triathlon!
Yes_comma_ I think so_comma_ she is amazing!
I just got a fresh haircut_comma_ shaved my beard_comma_ and a new suit for my date!
Thank you. I feel confident that this date will go well!
As long as she is willing to pay half the bill!
I had a Cobb salad for lunch earlier.
Yes_comma_ I do.  I was quite satisfied with the meal too.
I found a job that pays very well. I have money for everything that I need.
It's not but it is what I need right now.
Thanks! I will! I'm on to the next level.
I forgot to put on my e-brake in my car the other day.
Not well_comma_ it was pretty awful watching my 1.3 million dollar ferrari f40 roll into the lake.
I have been practicing driving all week for my driver exam. I think I am ready!
In a Honda Fit. Its a tiny car so it will make it easier to ace the parking part.
Looked up the recipe and went shopping and have everything I need!
I'm making chicken marsala by emeril. Bam!
I am ready to cook. been studying the recipe. I think it will be a hit.
5
oops!  sorry about that.  I want to tell you that I have been taking guitar lessons for almost a year now and will be playing in my first recital. I've got my song down perfectly so I know I'll do great.
I am taking them from a musician; private lessons.  Its been great!  I've always wanted to learn.
My mother was sick for a time_comma_ but she is now doing great_comma_
Yes_comma_ thank god!  
I accidentally spilled soup all over myself at the restaurant.
No_comma_ it was a mess.  I feel so humiliated for doing that.
It was rough comforting my friend when she left her boyfriend.
They were for 5 years_comma_ I brought her food to calm her down_comma_
Thank you I do my best_comma_ have you had a similar experience?
I feel so let down. I applied for a job_comma_ but didn't get it.
I guess I didn't do well on the interview. I need to find something soon though!
My roommate wants to get a cat. But he's already irresponsible enough as it is_comma_ and can't clean up after himself. How can he clean up after a cat_comma_ too? But I don't want to be the person to say no..
Yeah_comma_ you're right. I'm not good at confrontation_comma_ however. But yeah_comma_ I've already decided I don't want to take care of the cat myself_comma_ so if he can't do it_comma_ then it shouldn't be here. I just think he's kind of childish in the sense that he'll assume he can do it just so he can have the cat in the beginning_comma_ but later on he will get lazy.
My company just got a huge order from a Fortune 500!
Yep. It means we are anticipating a lot of work and a lot of money. So pay raises for everyone!
Today I am alone in the house_comma_ since everybody had something to do.
I usually enjoy it_comma_ but today I don't feel like been alone_comma_  I guess I should call a friend.
I just found out that I got every question on my last exam correct! I am super happy!
It was really difficult_comma_ but I studied really hard for this one!
Okay!
i missed my period_comma_ took a pregnancy test_comma_ and it's positive. I am not doing okay
a month and a half I would say..
I was crossing the street the other day. As I was crossing_comma_ I tripped and fell to the ground.
I scraped my knee and dropped my food.
I'm in no hurry to move out of my parents house.
Plus my moms my bestfriend so its a win win situation.
I finally get to go on vacation for the first time in 5 years! Only 7 more days away!
Going to the beach with just my little family of 4.  Looks like it's going to be beautiful weather!
A good friend of mine is moving to another city in the other side of the country.
To Seattle_comma_ I guess we won't see each other much in the future since I live  in Florida.
I have been faithful to my girlfriend of almost 3 years now
I plan on it_comma_ I cannot stand cheaters_comma_ that is my biggest no go
I told all my friends that I bought my Ferrari F-40 all by myself.
No. I couldn't get myself to tell them that it was really my dad that bought it for me.
My friend took me skiing_comma_ it was actually my first time skiing.
Yes I did at first_comma_ until I got the hang of it.
Ok I will try to have as much fun.
I went to a hanuted house ans severely underestimated how scary they are.
No i went with friends. I don't know if i would have made it through without help. Lol
My friend came over while I was on a trip and trashed my apartment_comma_ took things too.
He denied doing it. Said he was like that when he got there and he tried to clean up. The only other person who had keys to my place was with me
I walked through an old neighborhood with my son and was hit by a wave old memories. 
I actually lived there when I was a child. It was so nostalgic re-living those moments with my son.
I watched my daughter start high school this week
I was thinking back to when it just seems like yesterday I was walking her to her first day of kindergarten.
I was heartbroken when my grandmother passed away
Thank you_comma_ I appreciate that!
A dear friend of mine passed away last night.
yes_comma_ quite so.  he was only 45 years old.
While I was cooking_comma_ my 4 year old got into these paint markers and drew/painted all over himself and the furniture in his room. I didn't know whether to scream or cry.
I can't get it off the furniture which he just bought used but still new to us.  My blood was boiling but I tried to stay calm and firm.
I was cleaning up and found some old photographs of myself as a child today.
It made me feel nostalgic for my childhood.
Why yes I did.
I was roasting a chicken in the oven and forgot to put the timer on.
Well_comma_ it was so dry I had to find something else to eat. I was so mad!
Thats true. lol
My entire family was able to make it to our reunion. I was so happy to see them
It was fun. We held it at a beautiful state park and everything was perfect.
I failed my math exam. I am an idiot.
No_comma_ I will just have to get an A on my final.
I have been slaving away in the kitchen all day and my in-laws are about to arrive. I have falafel wraps with tzaitziki and tahini dressing and a couple sides. I'm ready!
I hope so too!  We love it and its all homemade. 
I love my girlfriend a lot_comma_ we have been dating for almost 3 years now!
maybe_comma_ we are not really set financially yet is all
It was my birthday and my spouse bought me a necklace with diamonds.
Yes I was_comma_ I felt love and appreciated. 
Oh yes_comma_ I deserved it. I am a good girl :)
I am so mad at my bank. they somehow thought to charge me for a credit card i didn't want.
Yes but i had to spend a whole hour on the phone explaining why they were at fault.
I agree!
Thank you. I hope they won't do anything like that in the future.
I am thinking about looking for a new job.
It is going fine but I would like to be closer to home. I just do not know if I should give this job up.
Recently I was looking to buy a car and even when I am not in the market anymore_comma_ sales people keep calling me everyday
Yes I guess next time I will give them a false number.
When I was a kid_comma_ I got chased down the street by the neighbor's dog.  She was literally nipping at my heels.
Yep!  I was saved by the bus driver lol_comma_ he showed up just in time.
I love video games _comma_ i used to love going to the arcades i would rack so many wins _comma_ and usually bummed when i would lose _comma_ ah the good old days
Its not for everyone _comma_ everytime i see an arcade its a blast from the past
I have to go back to work soon after being off on maternity leave.
I am dreading it because I do not like leaving my baby with anyone. I will be leaving her with a neighbor that I know will be good.
My son had an ingrown toenail so I took him to the podiatrist today. It was pretty gross!
He numbed up the toe and dug out the section that was ingrown. It was all red and infected. My poor kid!
my job interview coming up has me pretty nervous. I keep thinking about it.
Yes. I have trouble presenting my true self when under pressure.
Oh good idea! I will try that today.
I went to the doctor on Monday.
Not fun.  They did a biopsy.
Thanks for that!  I'm hoping there's nothing wrong.
My old cat is very sick and we have to put her down next week.
It is very difficult. She is 23 years old.
I was out on a bachelor party with my friends. A girl wanted my number but I told her I already have a great girl at home.
SHe really is great for me. I cant imagine being with anyone else.
My mom can be a little too persistent about things she doesn't know much about.
I feel like she wants to be in charge too much. it is kind of sad to watch.
That's good advice. It's not smart to get worked up over people who won't change.
My nephew took me riding with him after he got his drivers license. I had to believe that he would keep us safe.
It was a bit scary but we survived.
My nephew just started talking full sentences!
I know_comma_ it's so crazy!  He went from saying basically nothing to having full conversations.
I was able to graduate today after 4 years of school!
Thank you. There were a lot of moments i felt like giving up but i perservered!
Thanks! It is a great feeling!
My sister's husband is going out of town for the weekend and she hates being alone.
Yes. I invited her to come stay with me while he is gone.
I just learned that my niece was invited to the honor program in her new high school
Thank you for the advise_comma_ I'll do my best not to pressure her
Roommate just walked in on me while I was... trying to... "feel good" if you know what I mean. So awkward. My door doesn't have a lock_comma_ either. I told him to not come in_comma_ and he just kept coming in!
Yes_comma_ I was... self-pleasuring_comma_ if you can understand that. It was definitely an awkward and embarrassing position to be in. I just went out there and tried to have a normal conversation afterwards so that we could move on as quickly as possible. But I was mortified.
My mom just texted me a picture of her and I when I was really young. I'm on the other side of the country right now_comma_ and it made me miss her badly. Wish there was a way I had money to surprise visit her.
I know_comma_ right? And she's going through a tough time right now with my other brother_comma_ so I feel really bad for her. And I feel helpless since there's not much I can offer. I just try not to cause problems for her or make her worry_comma_ at the very least.
I was at a friends house and he had the grossest kitchen i had ever seen!
Oh man at least i don't have to live with it. I don't know how people are ok with nasty homelifves.
Some people are just wired differently i guess.
I got lost in a bad part of town
I did_comma_ thankfully. I had to rely on someone else's directions.
A complete stranger.
Isaw the most amazing sports play yesterday! I was shocked.
A wide reciever in a football game made a one handed catch.
I'm in a really awkward position. My best friend is cheating on his girlfriend_comma_ and my own girlfriend is telling me I need to speak up and reveal his secret. No idea what to do_comma_ and I'm disappointed in my friend_comma_ too.
You're right. I'm worried about having to possibly lose my best friend. I'm worried about having to stick my nose in other people's personal affairs. I'm worried about my girlfriend being mad about me being involved in it. It's all just a big hassle.
College football officially starts tomorrow.
I can't wait to watch some football!
Texas Tech Red Raiders!
My family threw a suprise get together for me!
It was. I had an overwhelimg feeling of joy. I really love my family.
I do! They made me who I am today.
I have been feeling a little nervous about getting into grad school.
Thank you_comma_ I sure hope so. What is your degree in?
After many years of depression_comma_ it looks like I am beginning to get better.
Thanks_comma_ I am hopeful that I can now restart my life where I left off before my depression. I will be completing my BA in a few months.
My daughter came to visit today. We had a really nice day.
Yes. I brought out the old photo album and we looked through and talked about the old days.
My husband's been out of town this week_comma_ and will be gone for another week.
I do.  It's so quiet without him_comma_ I can't get used to it.
My son informed me today that he was charged with possession of drugs
I suppose so. This is not how I taught to be and am so disappointed he has done this. 
My son will be turning 2 in a few months_comma_ and I am a little sad about it. 
Time just goes by so quickly.
I rented out my bedroom to Airbnb customers and when I returned it was left smelly and diapers every where.
Its okay. I called a deep cleaning company to clean it up because I so disgusted by it.
So jealous of my buddy.
He got some new shoes and mine are old and beat up.
Was able to negotiate the rent of my apartment back down to a better rate_comma_ after they had raised it for the new year. I was kind of worried I'd have to find a new place_comma_ but now I don't have to move anything and go through that annoying process
Not much. I plan on being able to relax now and not have to worry about finding a place and moving before school starts. I was really worried about it_comma_ since it was coming down to the wire. I can barely make the rent payments_comma_ but at least I won't have to pay for moving costs and all that.
I'm nervous about this test I did.
I studied pretty hard so I'm hoping for a great mark.
I really miss my aunt. I am a bit of a loner and she was the one i always talked to. I had to move far away from her recently.
Here soon i plan on it. And thank you! I am sure she feels the same way.
About 600 miles. So i'll most likely fly.
I've been considering adopting a cat_comma_ but I already have three dogs and I'm a bit afraid they won't take a liking to a new animal_comma_ much less a cat.
They're all huskies_comma_ so they're very smart dogs. Maybe I can slowly introduce them to the idea and keep them separated in different rooms.
Really? Well that gives me more confidence to take the dive and adopt a kitty!
My college entrance exam is tomorrow and I can't stop thinking I will fail.
Thanks. I hope I can at least get some sleep so that I cam fresh in the morning. 
"I was thinking about going camping_comma_ but I'm worried about the weather ruining it.
Unfortunately not_comma_ this time is the only time I can get off work until a few months later.
I have been working on training my puppy. He just started to grasp sitting.
We use his food and some bananas. He loves them and is allergic to a lot of different treats.
Man.....my cat died:( I feel horrible.
Old age. she had a good life but it's still tearing me up.
Holy Moly thats an old kitty.
Feeling pretty good about this upcoming math exam.
i don't but this is calculus and I went hard on it.
Someone had to walk into the bathroom after I had used it and made it smell really badly. As I was leaving_comma_ they made a comment about how bad it smelled_comma_ and I couldn't help but cringe
I know... nothing I could have avoided. Either that_comma_ or soil myself in public. Yeah_comma_ easy choice. I guess we all have those experiences from time to time. I will never eat spicy Indian food again_comma_ unless it's at home.
I am happy with my life right now_comma_ everything is going well
I have a good relationship_comma_ good friends_comma_ a decent job_comma_ and no debt! not much to complain about I guess!
I saw a strange shadow in the kitchen at night and froze in fear! 
Just the once. I couldnt even sleep the whole night thinking it was a ghost! 
My dog is getting on my nerves. he never shuts up.
The freaking wall from waht i can tell.
That might work. I haven't thought of that.
I got new neighbors recently. I wanted to do something nice so I baked a meatloaf for them. The problem is it smelled so good I had to try it first.
Yeah well it becomes a problem when I keep eating a little more until it is half gone. Now I have to bake another one! I felt so bad.
I worked really hard for a promotion at work and I ended up not getting it.
Thank you! I will keep trying and work harder next time.
I really enjoyed caring for patients in the Emergency Room while working at my previous job.
I was a patient access representative. I gathered information for the patients.
I was so into that guy. I thought he was really attractive. 
I really shouldn't because I have a serious boyfriend.
My girlfriend has been acting suspicious lately. Guarding her phone_comma_ being absent here and there when she didn't used to be. Having weird excuses for her weird behavior. She tells me nothing is going on_comma_ and I try to believe her. I don't know how much longer that will last.
I've talked to her about it a lot. At this point_comma_ I start to feel whiney. But I don't know what else to do. Avoid it when there's still concern? I'm still not getting the answers I want_comma_ and I still have suspicions.
I was sad as a kid when my pants fell down in class_comma_ everyone laughed at me
Yeah I definitely would have at that age haha
i am so appreciative to be able to be open and honest with my husband and to be able to have an amazing relationship
we started off long distance and i moved here shortly after. now we've been together going on 6 and a half years
it will be alright if you both put in your efforts and just stay open and honest. it's the most important part.
Mentioned my company on social media the other day. Now I'm getting told I have to meet with management after the weekend for something they can't talk about until then. I'm not sure how they could know about what I said_comma_ but I have no idea what else it could be_comma_ and I'm nervous.
Yeah_comma_ I tell myself I shouldn't_comma_ but I know I will. Like_comma_ there's no way they could tie my social media to me. But I never get called in to meet with these people. And it happens right after I made a negative comment about the company online? Can't just be a coincidence.
So upset at my brother for trying to fight me
We were quite furious_comma_ he was mad I wouldn't pass him the puck.
When my kids became adults_comma_ I gave away all their old toys. Or so I thought... Today I found one of my daughter's old dolls. It brought back so many memories I don't think I can get rid of it.
Well_comma_ I donated them to charity for kids who don't have much. 
She's 30 now. So it was quite some time ago that she played with this doll.
Luckily the braves are doing good this season_comma_ the past few years have been tough.

I am so happy with my life right now!
I have the best husband and children around!
In university_comma_ for my major of social work_comma_ we all get mandatory internships where they place us in certain ones and we have no control over it. Some other students received cool internship placements_comma_ and I feel like mine doesn't compare. Kind of disappointed I didn't get something more interesting
Yeah_comma_ that's kind of true. We can't change them while in school. They have to place so many people_comma_ so they can't really give people the flexibility of choosing where they want to go_comma_ or else that would get too complex and hectic. So_comma_ I understand that. But still.. some of these places don't match up to some others. I'll be twiddling my thumbs and not learning much_comma_ while others will get a good experience. I guess I just have to make the most of it.
My son is returning from his tour after ten years on Sunday!

My roommate promised he'd be good with cleaning up after his cat when he asked if he could get one. Now he's hardly ever cleaning the litter box. It's getting old really fast.
Yeah.. no kidding. But I'm not a confrontational person.. I don't want to be bossy. But it's like_comma_ you knew what you were getting into. If you didn't want to deal with cat poop_comma_ why get the cat? He's 25. He should be mature enough to know these things and deal with them. It's annoying to deal with this mess.
I have a big surprise party planned for my friend tonight.

I don't think it is. I've never had that problem before there. I just hope it doesn't happen again because I totally lost my appetite. 
I remember going to the beach every year when I was young. Wish I could do that again.
It was the best.  I really miss those special memories with my family.  It makes me want to do that with my kids.
My son just left for college and I don't want to throw away his old comic books and trophies. 
Yes I am really attached to his stuff. He told me get rid of his old stuff but I think I will let him know I just can't do it. 
I ate the last of my roomie's ice cream.
It was some Hagen Daz strawberry. Soo good_comma_ but I feel so bad about it haha.
Someone wrecked my car the other day. I'm so mad.
Yes but I have whip lash.
You ever just have a good week where nothing bad happens?
Yeah it's pretty good actually!  Nothing bad happened (knock on wood) and I can't really complain :D
Hey me too!  I hope yours is as well!!
Got everything packed and ready for my camping trip this weekend. Should be a great time.
Out in the woods near a friend's place_comma_ haven't been in a long time!
I need to clean my trash can.
It is super gross. Not yet but just the smell is horrid.
I'm furious_comma_ my cell phone bill this month is 200 dollars more than last months.
That's what I'll be doing next thing tomorrow_comma_ they didn't even give me a reason!
I was holding my brother's newborn earlier today... I held them up a little bit_comma_ with them facing down at me_comma_ and they puked all over me. Pretty cool. Can't get the smell of baby vomit out of my nose.
Yeah_comma_ it was kind of a wake-up call_comma_ since I'm of the age to have children. Like_comma_ "Well_comma_ this is what I have to look forward to." I'm not wild about the idea of having to deal with getting little sleep and having to deal with their bodily fluids. But I know it will make my wife happy.
My husband put together a graduation party for me and I had idea!
Sorry_comma_ I meant no idea. I was so happy and shocked.
My ex girlfriend was flirting with these guys right in front of me. She loves the attention.
I played it cool and then broke up with her a few days later.
Went on the very first job interview after graduating. I was nervous_comma_ but I felt like it went fairly well. They said they would contact me soon_comma_ but it's been a week. I'm not sure what I should do at this point_comma_ but I'm staying positive.
That's true.. I guess I hadn't thought of that. I kind of just framed it as_comma_ "Aren't I good enough? Then your search should be over!" But it would be dumb not to explore all options available. But this waiting is rough...
My baby boy just moved out to be on his own this last weekend.
It is.  It is the very thing we raise them to do_comma_ but it is so hard to let go.  After we got him all moved into his new home_comma_ I returned home and opened the family photo album to reflect on all of my 4 children.  I'm proud of them all_comma_ but I sure miss the days of their presence in my home. 
Ahh_comma_ the joys of visiting home. My mom fixed me 3 course meal of my most favorite dishes! 
I agree_comma_ always! I felt so content that I instantly fell asleep and ended up staying overnight!
i have done a very bad thing and feel terrible about it
i have been unfaithful to my spouse and have been lying about it. everything just came out
i ate my wife's leftovers while she was taking a nap
nah she hasn't yet but she is going to be pissed
Our home was broken into right after we moved in. I was so mad!
It was. I am so thankful we were not home.
I'm signed up to go sky diving soon for the first time.
Nice. I'm nervous about it but also looking forward to it.
I remember when movies actually focused more on the plot and acting rather than the special effects. I miss those times.
Hopefully it goes back to that_comma_ after all the special effect hype dies down!
I'm supposed to be on a diet_comma_ but today I ate a bunch of Hershey's Kisses.
Absolutely. I don't know why I even have them in the house. 
I am going to my favorite restaurant tomorrow i cant wait 
Shrimp and fried rice. It is a Japanese place
Something nice happened to me yesterday
I got a birthday card in the mail from an uncle I haven't heard from in forever
Yeah I'm gonna call him next week and say thanks :)
I remember when I was in 8th grade_comma_ I had to sing the national anthem at my middle school graduation in front of hundreds of students and parents
I was so nervous that I actually started choking up! Good thing people thought it was the microphone malfunctioning!
I was so relieved when my friends and parents complained about the microphone. That means nobody knew it was me!! 
So yea_comma_ last night my brain decided to replay a moment from high school when I forgot my lines in the live drama.
It was! I just completely blanked and started stuttering and mumbling. Eventually another actor came to the rescue and queued me back in.
One day after work_comma_ I was sitting at a table with one of my coworkers and my boss. I was 14 at the time and we worked in a bakery. I said something about brown cows and chocolate milk. That was when i realized that chocolate milk didnt come from brown cows. 
I know! I felt so dumb. We all laughed so hard. 
i was going to order some tshirts online_comma_but the website is from the ukrane and seems pretty sketchy
it just did not seem like a safe pay site. so even though i cannot find these items anywhere else_comma_ i decided not to buy
My boyfriend thought it would be funny to stand behind my door and scare me. I shrieked.
So mean!! I had coffee in my hand he made me spill it on the carpet. He takes advantage of how much of a scaredy cat I am!
Haha!! Same here! He did_comma_ but jeez_comma_ I wish he would stop. 
Man.  Only a couple weeks to go!!!
The family and I are going on a vacation to Florida.  So pumped!!
The only kid is my 3 year old nephew.  We're going to Panama City Beach!
My cat dragged a freakin OWL into the house through the dog door the other night. I came home at midnight to a pitch black house_comma_ went up the stairs_comma_ and something flew over my darn head. Turned the light on and he was staring back at me...
Yeah_comma_ my brother helped me. Made up some contraption with a fishing net and tying some wire around the netting_comma_ so when you pulled on the wire_comma_ it snapped the netting opening shut. Then we transferred it into a trash bag and let it loose. That thing was so spooky man. Cats... bleh.
Its been cloudy all day and I think it will rain heavily pretty soon!
I agree_comma_ I think I will just sit back and listen to some good jazz and read a book!
I got lost in an unfamiliar part of town.
I was_comma_ luckily a stranger was able to help me get back on track.
My friend just bought a car that I have been trying to afford for months!
Its a Tesla. I am beyond envious of him. It might take me another 3 years before I can buy one.
I am really excited for the new super smash bros_comma_ it looks awesome so far!
It comes out December 7th of this year!
I know my wife will be there for me_comma_ good or bad.
Yes_comma_ I got married later in wife. So I am lad I waited for the right women.
I'm in high spirits with my new job_comma_ I have a feeling I'm going to love working there. 
It's a graphic design job_comma_ something I've been doing a while but I really like the vibe at my new company!
My neighbor is so luck
lucky**    Because a large meteor landed over there on his property and he gets to keep it!!
Yeah I just wanna go over there and touch it.  I doubt he'll let me though.  Dang that guy!
I wasn't too sure I got the right hairstyle but today a stranger complimented me on my hair! 
They said it looks beautiful and unique. I feel so much more confident now!
watching old black and white western tv shows really brings back good memories of my grandparents
it does. i really dont have a favorite_comma_ i never paid attention to them too much as a kid. but i do rember bonanza
My ex and I went to Branson a few weeks ago. It was so much fun!
well we broke up afterwards lol. But the trip was still fun. There are some cool things to do there depending on where you live. 
My tooth has been killing me lately.
I don't know_comma_ but I have a dentist appointment next week. I hate going and I really don't want to.
I get sentimental about my girlfriend_comma_ she means a lot to me
I sure do_comma_ I hope things work out!
I spent this entire summer thinking I was going to lose weight_comma_ that I was going to be good on my diet and workout. I did neither. I stayed inside_comma_ played video games_comma_ ate horribly_comma_ and got grumpy ate everybody who reminded me of my promise. Now winter is coming and it's going to be even harder to motivate myself.
I had never heard that phrase before_comma_ but I like it. Yeah_comma_ I'm throwing myself a big pity party right now. It's all my own fault though_comma_ no one else to blame. My wife tries to cook healthy meals_comma_ and encourages me. I just have to not let stress get me to overeat. We'll see how the winter goes.
My friend just bought a new Range Rover.
I know_comma_ I am so envious of him.
my grandmother passed yestserday. she was the one who raised me
yeah. i was fine yesterday but today has been hard. i usualy dont  show much emotion but i cant help it.
I'm very disappointed in the pizza I ordered. It was pretty much burnt with no toppings!
Yeah_comma_ I already did_comma_ they gave me credit but overall its a very disappointing supper!
Pepperoni and sausage.
Every time I watch baseball_comma_ I think of my grandpa.
Cause we use to go to the games together.
I have to build an IKEA dresser tomorrow.
It's not fun but I am sure I can build it.
I bought all the ingredients_comma_ learned the recipe_comma_ and now its time to make a pizza!
You must have ordered it. I usually like homemade pizza on weekends like today!
I came home to a huge pile of dog poop_comma_ it was absolutely disgusting.
No_comma_ that's the worst part! I don't even have a dog!
I'm worried about my job interview tomorrow_comma_ I really want this job. I hate this feeling!
It's for a graphic design job_comma_ I've never worked in the field but it has always been a passion of mine.
So the new paper boy tried to toss the paper over the fence and ended up breaking my window.
I suppose its funny now but I was furious in the morning! It might cost me a couple of hundred to get it fixed! 
My dog and cat can't seem to get along.
Yes everything. My dog is too stubborn.
I was so sad when my hamster died recently due to a heart attack. Maybe I shouldn't have fed him so many cheetos. I cry every day thinking about him.
Thanks for the kind words. I really miss him so much. I will never find another pet quite like Bubbles.
I'm terrified of meeting my girlfriend's parents tomorrow. She said they never like her choice of boyfriends!
I'm going to do my best_comma_ she did say she thinks they will like me unlike her past boyfriends.
Driving is such a scary thing for me_comma_ it was my first time.
I just don't quite know how to steer the car.
I have to make a brisket tomorrow.
I am so ready to do it.  I have everything.
I went through an old photo album that I didn't even know existed when I was cleaning out my attic!
Yes it sure did. It hit me with a wave of nostalgia and brought back some great moments.
its so hard to find a reliable person to babysit nowadays
yeah_comma_there are a lot of creepers or malicious people in the world
I lost my credit card and someone charged 500 dollars on it.
Yeah_comma_ but it's a big hassle.  I am so angry about it.
Halloween is scary stuff that's for sure.
No we went to a haunted house and I got chased often.
The policeman was nice bringing me home.
I crashed my dirtbike so he drove me home but i was scared of him.
I just gave my best friend a key to my house. I have known him my whole life and I feel safe with him having access to my home.
He is a good friend so I wanted him to be able to come by when I am not there and check on things. Also if he wants to hang out for a while.
I hesitated before getting on the rollercoaster because it looked so scary! 
Same. But the thrill that you feel is worth the terror and tension! 
tonight i tripped while out at dinner_comma_ total clums
Yes_comma_ i totally was!
lol_comma_ too funny! 
I recently came across my old high school year book. 
Yes_comma_ definitely. Was a great trip down memory lane.
I already booked my flight for vacation before requesting a leave from work!
I sure hope so! I am quite hopeful that I will get my holiday approved since I have worked overtime for 3 months!
I remember when people used to be more courteous.
When strangers would say hello and good morning.  Those were the good old days.
I have a flight coming up and i absolutely hate flying.
I think im going to take some sleeping pills and attempt to sleep.
I accidentally didn't confess all my sins oops.
I sometimes disobey my parents.
I'm a bit let down by my workplace recently
Well we had vacation we were promised_comma_ and I planned for_comma_ but then due to an emergency it all was cancelled.
I love my wife so much!
We have been together for 10 years.  I would never cheat on her.
I accidentally hurt my dog pretty bad.
I accident closed the car door on his tail.
Thank you! He is a tough guy. I feel bad though_comma_ i should have been more careful.
I have a job interview coming up!
Yeah I'm pretty sure I got this!!
Heck yeah!  Wish me luck!
There is nothing I can complain about. I have a nice house_comma_ a great family and a decent job. Life is good.
Not at the moment. I do count my blessings every day. I realize how fortunate everything has gone well for me.
Last month I found out my son decided to drop out of college without telling me.
Its worse. He decided to use my tuition money to pay for his drug addiction. I am so disappointed in him.
My mom has taken on my brother's two children in the interim while he deals with social services_comma_ for getting in trouble with the law. She's in her 60s_comma_ and she's handling a 2-year-old and 7-year-old_comma_ while working full time. I'm proud of her.
I love her. She has so much patience to deal with it all_comma_ and she does it all with kindness_comma_ and tries to be as loving as possible to the children. But I wish she were harder on my brother. Sometimes I feel like she enables him_comma_ by how much she helps him_comma_ and prevents reality from slapping my brother in the face. Either way_comma_ she's a great woman.
I accidentally bounced a check today.
No_comma_ I thought my deposit had cleared but it won't for a couple more days.  I am so upset I did that.
I work as a self-employed transcriptionist. I told my client I'd have work done this week_comma_ but my university classes also started this week... and things kind of got away from me_comma_ and they won't be done. I'm worried he's going to just tell me he'll have someone else do them_comma_ and I'll lose his business.
Yeah_comma_ definitely. And it's one of my worst skills. I don't really have an excuse. I have to get better at handling stress.
It was so awkward when I realized I had worn my wife's dress to work the other day. My first clue something was wrong was when I felt I was wrapped like a stuffed sausage.
That thought crossed my mind but my wife didn't want me ripping her clothes. Luckily I had another suit in the office I changed into.
I felt good about my job interview_comma_ I think that I have a good chance to get the job
Thank you_comma_ I appreciate it!
I won tickets to my favorite show! Yahoo!
A music show_comma_ its my favorite band.
The grateful dead.
I'm back in my old college town for the first time since graduating. It's weird how many memories flood back from just physically being in a space. I'm seeing all the places I used to eat_comma_ my old apartment_comma_ my campus_comma_ and my friends here and there... makes me wish I could go back
Definitely. And also seeing the people. Some grow up_comma_ some don't. Some want to be the same kind of person that they were in college_comma_ and drag you down with them when you see them again. Have to make sure I avoid those.
Yeah... right there with you... $43_comma_000 and interest. Woo.
I saw a grown woman pick her nose and eat it earlier. 
I was so grossed out by it.  I think it has to be a oral fixation or something like that.
Maybe it helps build their immune system.
I was traveling last month and the airplane smelled like it hadn't been cleaned for months.
I did because I was disgusted by it! Safe to say_comma_ I am never flying American Airlines again! 
I kept thinking I had left the front door unlocked whilst I was on vacation!
Sounds like Home Alone! Yes I was so anxious the entire time that I could not even enjoy myself.
I am so looking forward to the next Avatar sequel. It seems like I have been waiting forever. I am growing impatient.
James Cameron's Avatar. I love sci fi and cant wait to see what happens to the Na'vi next.
Yeah there are multiple sequels in the works. I am sure the wait will be worth it!
I am upset the Eagles lost yesterday_comma_ they lost to the worst team in the league_comma_ and got shutout
I guess not_comma_ but they will put it together soon
I woke up and saw someone staring at me in the middle of the night!
It was just come creep from next door! It was still very terrifying and I had to tell him to leave or I would call the police.
I am worried about my upcoming court date. :(
Yea that's what my attorney keeps telling me. I don't want to have to pay a large fine.
I was.. at home alone.. doing some self-pleasuring_comma_ if you will... and my roommate almost walked in on me. I managed to jump into my closet while pulling up my pants before he could see me. So happy I didn't have to have that awkward conversation
He did.. and I said_comma_ "Hold up_comma_" but I guess he heard something else? I mean... c'mon man. It's annoying. I wish my door had a lock_comma_ but it's some old 1950s apartment complex and everything is old. I guess people from the 50s didn't need to lock their doors. Lucky them. But I guess they had lamer porn back then_comma_ too.
I love going back and playing Pokemon Emerald_comma_ that game was a massive part of my childhood
It sure does_comma_ I played that game for 600+ hours
My husband is training a new female employee at work.
I do not like it at all. He takes her to lunch everyday and I think it is wrong.
I have to go to a doctor's appointment on Monday.
Yeah_comma_ it's just a checkup but hospitals make me so nervous.
My best friend got such a pretty girlfriend. I don't know how he does it. I look better than him but he gets the pretty girls.
I wish I had the game he has. I think I need to cut my hair like him to get a better chance with the ladies.
I don't know if you have experience with small children_comma_ but when my daughter was 3 years old_comma_ she spoke her mind all the time.
Numerous times!  The most memorable was when we were checking out at the grocery store.  The cashier was a man that had an earring.  She promptly (and very clearly and loud) told him "Boys don't wear earrings and you need a haircut"
I am ready for the new pokemon game_comma_ I am super excited_comma_ it looks like an amazing game!
It is new_comma_ it integrates with pokmeon go actually!
It is for the nintendo switch_comma_ and it can transfer pokemon from pokemon go over_comma_ it is a remake of the classic games that came out in the 90s_comma_ with way better graphics
I saw this amazing dog on the television the other day.
He was going through an obstacle course and it was suprising.
I found a little girl that was lost wandering around the mall. I took her to one of the stores so they could call security. Her mother finally found her.
No idea. Her mom was very appreciative I made sure that they were reunited. She gave me her number and I got a date with her tomorrow night!
I am hoping I will get promoted at my job soon enough_comma_ that would be great
Haha_comma_ thank you_comma_ I appreciate it
I made the luckiest choice investing in bitcoin.
I made thousands. enough tolive comfortable for a whole year!
It was more luck :)
Haha thank you

I am not happy with how the Eagles played yesterday_comma_ they lost to the browns of all teams- by 5 points_comma_ 5-0_comma_ what a lame game
My mom is starting to develop dementia early. I feel like I'm losing such an important figure in my life much earlier than I should_comma_ even though she's still alive. Like_comma_ she struggles so much with daily activities and remembering who I am
Yeah_comma_ I'm not looking forward to going down it. I'll just try to carve out as much meaningful time with her as I can. I feel selfish sometimes though because there are times when I don't want to be around her because it depresses me how she's changed. I need to get over it.
I am not happy with how the Eagles played yesterday_comma_ it was not good
I know_comma_ it was a shame_comma_ but it is only preseason
I went for a ride on a roller coaster the other day and it rattled me.
The mamba in KC.
Big_comma_ huge_comma_ massive drop. Scared the bajesus out of me.
Just bought some luggage bags.  Getting ready!
Hey thanks!  I've never flown before.  We're driving down to Florida in a couple weeks.  Should be about a 9 hour drive!
Yeah!  I'll have some company!  Our whole family is going LOL
Spent the entire summer with my long distance girlfriend_comma_ and now I'm back at home for university. Kind of a bummer that now not only do I not have her company_comma_ but I have to deal with school stuff. From one extreme to the other.
Yeah_comma_ we went to Estes Park_comma_ in Colorado_comma_ and hiked at the base of the Rocky Mountains. First time I ever saw mountains. Pretty cool experience. I had to drive the whole way to Colorado though_comma_ so I can relate to the road trip thing.
I am scared of how work is going to go_comma_ it is the start of our busiest period of the year
That period probably lasts about 2 months
I moved to a new area and feel isolated because i don't know anyone.
A new job.
I hope so! I hate this feeling.
I am jealous of my coworker_comma_ he is very smart and athletic
That is true_comma_ but I still catch myself wishing I was better

Sometimes they do_comma_ it is tought though_comma_ it is way busier than it has been the past few months
My classmates at university are so gossip-y. They get so catty with one another_comma_ and spread rumors behind each other's backs. We're in a small major_comma_ so everyone knows everyone in this group of 50 students_comma_ and a lot of them dislike each other for no good reason
It seems like it_comma_ right? The things they chirp and fight about seem so pointless. Must be because they're bored_comma_ I dunno. I just stay out of it.
I won a small contest. So_comma_ my friend was there when I entered the contest_comma_ and he was the one that encouraged me to enter. Now that I won_comma_ he says he deserves some of the winnings because he was the one that made me enter. I disagree. But he keeps bothering me about it.
Yeah_comma_ I don't think that will fly. I won a prize and he wants to split the prize. He knows the odds are small. So since I won_comma_ he wants to forget about trying to do it himself_comma_ and just wants what I got.
I lsot my job the other day and am pretty lost myself.
Wow thank you for the kind words. I will do my best :0
Wow what an absolutely amazing day!
My mother got me a new puppy_comma_ his names Jim.

We are supposed to get severe thunderstorms tomorrow.
I enjoy them if they don't get dangerous. I put together a storm emergency kit just in case.
Today when I was walking home from the park a pit bull chased after me.
Yeah_comma_ it only wanted to play but I was scared for my life.
I recently started dating again and i just can't wait to see her again.

I had to go to Walmart the other day to get my nephew a birthday present_comma_ he wanted Legos!
They really have!  I was standing in the aisle looking at all the options and it just hit me_comma_ I don't have Legos all over my living room floor anymore.  Talk about crying in the middle of Walmart because your kids have outgrown Legos!
I saw a man eat a 3 foot sub sandwich.
Yeah_comma_ it was very inspiring to me.
I was shocked to see a well known good team defeat another well known bad team in a football game last night.
I am an underdog lover so the bad team. It was cool to see.
Oh gosh i worded it incorrectly. They actually won! haha sorry.
I lost my wallet and someone found it and returned it to me.

Hey thanks :D
I was starting a new job and could not sleep the night before. I was feeling extremely anxious about the decision to change jobs.
Not really_comma_ but after the first day it was a lot easier and I knew that I had made the right choice.
I had to go to lunch by myself today.
Yeah_comma_ I hate being by myself.  It makes me sad.
One year i filed false tax forms and i feel really bad about it. I feel like i cheated on society.
No but i want to somehow fix my mistake.
Yea that is true.

This past wednesday_comma_ I left my class very late and there weren't many people outside_comma_ and a random car pulled up to the curb where I was.
I'm not too sure_comma_ but it was just dark and empty_comma_ and my first instinct was to just run_comma_ and that's what I did. The car didn't follow me thankfully.. maybe it was just random. But it was sketchy. 
Exactly! It was really scary_comma_ and I would rather be safe than sorry. 
I love my dog. he will do anything for me. He scared home invaders away the other night.
Haha i agree. We are too lucky evolution provided such wonderful cute creatures.
I went to Burger King today and they totally messed up my order.
No_comma_ I didn't bother.  I was too irritated.
You know what I tried the other night?
I was at a restaurant and they had deep fried eggplant.  I thought I would try it.    NEVER AGAIN THAT STUFF WAS NASTY AND GROSS
I shoulda taken it back to the kitchen and made them eat it
My life is horrible right now. i lsot my job and my girlfriend broke up with me. :(
I hope so. I need some type of boost to help me be more motivated.

He keeps pinching me every morning at school.

My highschool basketball squad! Thank you very much.
I had to take my dog to be put to sleep a few days ago.
No_comma_ he is dead.  He was really old and suffering.  I was so hurt having to do that.
I was surprised a co-worker of mine just got a raise! He doesn't do much work at all...
That's what I am wondering! Just a bit miffed about it. I think I do twice the work.
It might be a worth a shot to do that and stand my ground on my next contract renewal time.
Haha thank you for that!
I saw my 3 year old nephew yesterday
It went awesome!  I haven't seen him in forever and we played all day!
Yeah!  Because of my work schedule I don't see him that much.  It's been awhile but we had a blast!  
I went to the Olive Garden for dinner tonight.
I had the chicken alfredo.  It was somewhat fun.  I was pleased with my meal.
My friend won an award i was also going for

I heard a loud crash in my backyard!!
I looked out my back door and I think it's the aliens!  Too scared to go look.  It looks like a big ship.
Yeah kinda.  I don't think they're going anywhere now since they crashed back there.   Maybe I'll go back there and see.  Dunno though.  i'm scared
I just went cliff diving recently.
Yes_comma_ first time. I wasn't even nervous actually. I surprised myself. It was a lot of fun.
Yes_comma_ I definitely want to do it again. It was such an awesome rush!

My youngest niece will be 17 soon. I find myself thinking back to when she was little and I just get teary eyed.
All those little moments just come to mind and I get so emotional.
I have to make a six layer bean dip later today.
Not really but I am so ready to do it.
My nephew joined the football team this year
Not sure yet they haven't told him.  I can't wait to go to one of his games and watch him play though
Yeah!  He's pretty darn good at it.  I hope they give him a good position.  
Hey thank you! :D
I will begin my first day of work on Monday and I think I'm ready for it.
Yes_comma_ you are right. That is what I am hoping it will go like. Fingers crossed.
My dog died and I was just heartbroken. I got her when she was a puppy and she lived to be 20 years old.
She truly was an amazing dog. She followed me everywhere_comma_ I should have named her Shadow.
I got a ticket earlier for driving 1 mile over the speed limit.
No_comma_ I was just going at my normal pace.  I was so angry getting that ticket.
I remember when gas was only a dollar a gallon.
It was about 25 years ago.  Those were the good old days.
I got a retro video game system the other day.
It was a Super Nintendo Mini. It really took me back to my childhood days.
I wanted to do something to show my Mom some love so I made her a dinner of all of her favorites. I made extras for the freezer so she would be able to enjoy them again.
She was thrilled. It was just a small gesture to show her that she is loved.
I remember singing in the choir as a child.
It takes me back to a special time.
i have an exam tomorrow but i know i will do well!
i agree!
School started off with a real bang for me this week.  Ugghhh.
I was given a lecture to my morning class and when the class was over a student came up to me to tell me my pants were unzipped.
I'm going to see a film tonight at the cinema.
I think it's called the Happytime Murders. Some murder mystery/comedy with puppets.
This weekend is so boring so far
Just nothing to do and no one to do it with.  I'm just sitting around at home.
Nothing yet.  Maybe I'll call a friend or something.  
I tried to buy a newspaper this morning but it was sold out.
It has special coupons in it.  I am so upset I couldn't get one.
I was so let down by a film I watched.
It was called The Meg. It was alright_comma_ but not as fun as I was expecting. A bit by-the-numbers for me.
It's a wonderful Saturday morning and I am so anxious to see what today has to offer!
Thank you_comma_ I am starting the day fishing and I am hopeful that the fish are biting.
I went to the bathroom and walked in to a horror show.
Yes_comma_ my roomie had used the toilet and neglected to flush.
Man something bad happened yesterday
I came home from work and my fish was dead
Yeah.  It was very awful coming home to that.  I've had that fish for 37 years and he was my friend.

Someone tried to break into my house last week when I was home!
Yeah it sure was. I was so scared I didn't know what to do.
my friend cancelled on me last minute
not really i was quite sad
I drank all of my best friend's beer and didn't tell him.
He hasn't figured it out yet. I could still do that I suppose_comma_ before he realizes it.
I am a very dedicated member of my family which sometimes can be a bit much to handle.
Not so much trouble.  They stay into trouble and run to me to bail them out.  However_comma_ they don't know how to reciprocate.
I definitely think so.  I'm not sure that they will ever get it.  Being there for me is just a part of my nature.
i had to send my food back tonight at the restaurant. we were at my favorite restaurant 
i am normally not picky with mistakes on my food_comma__comma__comma_but i ordered a chicken sandwch and the chicken was still very pink/ red in the middle

thankfully my fiance doesn't like monster that much
You know what really grinds my gears?
My new printer!  I just bought it and it's giving me all kinds of problems already!
It's an HP laserjet or something like that.  I can't get it to work and it's very frustrating.
I have a fishing tournament today which I am pretty certain I will win.

I am pretty certain that I have everything we need for the weekend getaway.
worst nightmare 
i had like 2 nightmares today and didn't sleep well and i got terrified 
I'm having such trouble with a co-worker.  She has no manners at all!
I hurt my foor a few days ago and have been limping a bit.  So she goes and calls me crippled at first and she keeps calling me slow and laughing really hard.
I hope so.  I'm debating whether to let me boss know.  If she does that to a stranger she could be gotten for violating the ADA
someone almost hit me with their car today
walking_comma_ i was scared for my life
I didn't have enough money to pay for my groceries and had to put something back. There were a lot of people in line.
I was mortified. I probably could have started a fire with just the color of my face.
I feel happy with myself right now.
Sure_comma_ it was just that I managed to clean my entire house this morning in just a few hours. I defied my own expectations.
i am over the moon_comma_ do you know how it feels like to have someone that always supports you
i hope so_comma_ stay strong man! it's going to be okay

When tax season came I was in a hurry to get mine done. I was looking forward to a big refund.
I tricked myself into saving by over paying on purpose.
I am so lucky to have someone like my fiancee
That's great! Just the fact that she is always there for me whenever I am in need. 
I'd say it is_comma_ for sure! 
My daughter started high school this week. I am so proud!

Yeah_comma_ he did a great job! Fed the dog and everything. I was satisfied. 
When I was a kid my sister got the bike that I really wanted. I begrudged her that bike for a long time.
It was especially hard because she didn't really care about the bike. 
You know that's funny because I did!
I CAN'T WAIT! I CAN'T WAIT! next week i am finally going to take a holiday
thank you! i am so excited! are you going anywhere? 
i saw a guy lie his way through taking a test

I finally did it_comma_ opened up to her.
Very well_comma_ I told her all my dark secrets and she was okay with it.
I dont really know anyone at uni

I'm so upset right now.
My brother died earlier in a car wreck.
I like to do all of my shopping for Thanksgiving dinner early so I will be ready and I don't have to fight the crowds.
I scour the sales ads for the early specials and then make my list accordingly. 
i almost wasnt going to take my pharmacy tech certification exam. was too expensive
luckily my aunt paid my fee of $275 as an early birthday gift. i passed the test
It's such a tough choice whether to apply to university or not.
I'd likely work at my dads business instead_comma_ he sells cars.
I dont really know anyone at uni
yea but its just hard being an introvert and trying to meet people
My brother is lucky to have me that's for sure.
He broke up with his girl and I was there to keep him sane.
Sushi really creeps me out_comma_ I wasn't able to try any.
The texture scares me_comma_ I think I'm very apprehensive about it.
Sucks not being strong.
I wasn't able to do 15 push ups in front of my team of guys.
Wow have you ever driven a manual car?
It's hard for sure_comma_ I'm trying to learn but it's kind of embarrasing.
I was in a hurry to get home but I hit every red light and was late. By the time I got home I was fit to be tied.
I was bringing something home that was going to be part of supper but since I was late we didn't get to have it. Since I had really wanted it I was pretty ticked off.
I caught every red light.

I recently had an experience that I need to get off my chest.
I was spending a night over with my girlfriend at her mom's house & things ended up happening between her mom & I.
While my girlfriend was sleeping we ended up having sex.
It's not something I'm proud of.
my house has been very quiet since my dog died last week
he was with us for 11 years
i hate when someone does not take the hint to stop talking

I was watching some old TV shows and it really made me start thinking about my childhood.
For sure. It's funny how something like that can just transport you back to yesterday.
I was really missing my dog Freddy today. He passed away recently at age 16. He was my constant companion.

Yes it is geez! If I knew I would have never go with him.
Okay next time I will ask before going out with him.
Someone threw a bunch of empty beer cans in my truck bed.
I went to the nearest gas station and borrowed their trash can.  It's a bad idea to drive around with a truck bed full of beer cans.
Some people are jerks.

It was only off for a little over 2 hours_comma_ but I could not find a flashlight and it was so scary.

There was a story about a duck being a mother to 76 ducklings.  It was so sweet.

Yes I tried my best to make sure that these people were willing and able to take very good care of him.
My roommate and best friend just moved out.

I will.  Just send me your bank account details and I'll keep it on the back burner ;)
I remember the first time I went to the movie. It was with my friends and I was eager to go.

I used to get nervous and anxious whenever someone would try to start a fight or argument with me...now I don't ever back down_comma_ and it helps I've been boxing and wrestling for 5 years
Yes too many people talk a big game but can't back it up.  Sometimes I just want someone to blatantly talk crap so I don't have to do any talking hahaha
My kid lied to me yesterday.
Not really_comma_ they are young_comma_ but they were trying to get a sibling in trouble instead of themselves.  I wasn't expecting it at such a young age...only 3.
I told my husband that I was going to see a friend when I didn't. I went to a party planner's place.
Yes! I feel bad for lying to him but I would only ever do it for his own good.  Its nagging at me already though.  I might up the date of the party so I don't have to lie too much!

I am very nervous.  It is completely optional so I might just cancel it.
I had surgery a few weeks ago. It was tough_comma_ but my friends really helped out.
My knee. But what's important is that my friends brought over dinner for a week so I wouldn't have to cook. They're really wonderful and I'm very lucky to have them as friends.

I am waiting for some blood and other test I have to had last week_comma_ because I was not feeling well.
I am already feeling better_comma_ but I hope everything is fine.
Today was a great day. I was able to knock out a bunch of stuff that needed to be done and now I have the rest of the day to relax. Just sitting around with a nice cup of coffee. Very peaceful.
Gotta have at least one cup every morning! Without it_comma_ I feel like my day never gets started.
At my home we use artificial sweetener instead of sugar in our coffee. I was fixing my mother in law a cup of coffee and it slipped my mind that we don't use sugar and so I handed the cup to her. She ended up spitting coffee everywhere as a reaction. I feel like an idiot.
Yeah_comma_ she laughed it off and she actually felt bad for spitting it out.
I was at work and my friend left to go to the bathroom and didn't come back for what seemed like 30 minutes! There were so many customers that I had to deal with!
He did_comma_ when he came back I was mad but he really picked up the rest of the day leaving me little work
My boyfriend recently proposed!
We haven't set a date yet_comma_ but my heart is filled with happiness
My little brother took my bike without asking me_comma_ and he left it outside the shop_comma_ then it got stolen! I'm so angry right now
Yeah_comma_ he does things like this all the time. He doesn't have any money to replace it_comma_ either.
Last year a hurricane hit my area. Luckily I had planned well and had all the supplies I needed to stay safe. I am always thinking ahead like that.
Yeah I had plenty of food_comma_ batteries_comma_ first aid_comma_ and entertainment to keep me busy. It wasn't so bad.
I studied for four years at the university.
I majored in Political Science. I will be graduating this year.
I am confident I will soon find a well paying job that will allow me to pay my student debt
I will thank you for the advise.  Yes it is hard_comma_ I am glad to hear some schools will be free son so student don't get such a load.
I have a phobia of water_comma_ and my boyfriend made me go out on his boat last weekend.
I was very scared and I won't be doing it again!
My daughter got a birthday card full of money this week and I took the cash before she could see it.
I'm desperate for cash.  I feel really bad about it_comma_ but I like having my knee caps intact.  I guess she'll find another way to pay for college anyway.
I hurt my neck today. I must have slept on it wrong and my sweet husband gave me a neck massage to help. It was so sweet.
He's the best.  I was able to get up and get cleaning and work done today thanks to him. 
I lost my house in a fire last year. All my friends banded together to help me in any way they could think of.
I stayed with some for a while. They also gave me hand me down things that I lost. I am so thankful to have great friends.
I was at the fair the other day and I smelled funnel cakes. It reminded me of home
They did! It reminded me of when my mom used to make them from scratch
Yeah
My boyfriend came home with a brand new car for me_comma_ one that I really wanted.
Yes_comma_ I was shocked and happy at the same time!
I haven't seen my son in 2 years since he left for the military.
I don't but he told me he will be home to visit me for my birthday. I can't wait!
I recently got the news that my grandfather has cancer. I was so had to hear that because he is a great guy and doesn't deserve it.
Yeah_comma_ I just hope it doesn't spread. Perhaps he can still lead a normal life.
I had not seen my best friend in over 3 years.
He had just been busy with life. But he was at my house when I got home for work.
Something smelled really bad at work the other day. We found an old moldy rotting sandwich in a coworkers desk.
I have no idea. We found it after she left. It was really gross. I wonder if her house is that nasty?
I have a coworker that plays their music so loud I can hear it from their headphones. I keep asking them to turn it down but they keep cranking it back up.
Ive asked my manager to say something. Hopefully that happens Monday. I cant take it anymore.
Ugh so a few weeks ago my 3 year old broke my favorite eyeshadows.
Yeah_comma_ I should have probably put it in a safer spot. Oh well.
I was waiting for a friend to bring some food to the party and they never showed up. I was really sad and we had to go get it ourselves
Yeah_comma_ they had to go pick up some of their family. We forgave them and everything is alright now
While my job doesn't pay a lot_comma_ it's very rewarding. I work as a caregiver and it feels  so good to make someone happy.
It's not hard to get into_comma_ honestly. Especially if you know someone who needs help with daily living activities. Seeing a smile on their face when you walk in make it worth it!
So my 4 year old just learned how to spell his name last week.
I am! I've been working so hard with him lately! 
My phone is acting up again.
No_comma_ but I am going to have to take it in again.
Someone bumped into my car in an intersection and took off.
Yes it is and now I am left to deal with the cost.
My son struggled all through school with his grades.
He is. He will be graduating this year and going off to college.
So my 4 year old gets to start preschool in a week.
A little. I think that's normal though. Glad he'll start to make new friends though.

My son just graduated from college.
I know! It is just crazy how time flies. I know he will do great things.
I got a package in the mail of a purse i wanted and have no idea who it came from.
Thanks. It was totally unexpected.
I was at a restaurant and I got a hair in my food! I was appalled!
I told the waitress and they gave me another plate for free
My family left today after a long visit to my house. I miss them already and wish I lived near them.
I usually see them a couple times a year so maybe near Christmas time.  Its just so quiet and boring now. 
I was waiting on some pregnancy test results from the doctor.
 My appointment is next week and my nerves are all over the place
so a while aog my cat went missing and i found her ran over in the road.

I definitely will. I hear that it's beautiful there!
I cannot wait for Christmas!  It is such a happy time!
Everything about it just puts me in a good mood!
I helped tutor my nephew in algebra. He ended up passing with an A. That made me very happy.
I am very much so. I think it gave him the boost to continue making good grades.
I walked into a public restroom then quickly walked out.
All of the toilets had overflowed and the floor was covered with brown stuff.
My best friend is coming visit me. I cant wait to go out and party. It has been too long.
Its been about a year. We both moved away after college.
I like to be well ready for a big trip_comma_ don't you ?
It's almost as good as going on the trip itself.
My wife just gave birth to our 11th child. 
Thank you!  It is crazy that I feel just as happy about this one as I did 14 years ago when our first was born.
We just bought a used car and we've already had to take it to the shop
Yeah_comma_ it's annoying. Hopefully nothing else goes wrong with it.
One time  i forgot to pay for a candy bar before leaving the store.
Yeah_comma_ I didn't get caught but took it back anyway.
I am getting ready to apply to graduate school_comma_ and I am feeling a little nervous.

I just found out the small company I work for is going out of business. I cried all day Friday when I found out because I love working for them

My parents just gave me the best birthday present ever.
They paid off my car.  I have been trying to save for a house_comma_ but I wasn't going to buy one until my car was paid for.  It was going to be 4 years_comma_ but now I don't have to wait!

Haha! That's pretty thoughtful_comma_ considering they'll be busy with baby stuff! Very creative! Lol. Thanks!
My life is great!
My wife and son are amazing
My best friend just moved to another state.

My friend was struck by a meteor
Actually... yeah. You know him?
About a year ago I lost my grandmother to cancer. I was really close to her.
I'm sorry. It's really tough sometimes even thinking about it.
I hate when people get too close to me standing in line
Absolutely_comma_ a little space would be nice!
My son threw a pillow at my daughter while she was eating some pasta. She had on a really cute outfit. Of course it is stained now.
I know. I think i died a little inside when I saw her clothes.
It really bothers me when people stand right on top of me in line
Its not like they can go anywhere so back on up!
I lost my bottoms at the water park_comma_ while going down the slide. It was horrible.

I got an older car for my 16th birthday_comma_ but my best friend got a BRAND new BMW! Ugh_comma_ life is so unfair.

I really enjoy my job_comma_ I was just looking for a better opportunity.

I'm thinking about how I can ruin his life without getting caught. I'm so mad right now_comma_.
I met a girl from South Korea who has been travelling the world by bicycle alone. She created a blog and has had people support her to continue travelling.

Me too. I want to start a blog. Problem: Im a lazy writer.
I have a friend that has become a millionaire from trading cryptocurrency.
Well they have plummeted back down so you can get in pretty cheap again_comma_ but it might not be a good idea at this point.

I had a necklace that my mother gave me before she passed away_comma_ but I just lost it.
I think it may have been stolen.  I was at the pool and took it off.  When I got done swimming it was gone.
Someone was stealing mail out of my mailbox.
They did thankfully. It made me so mad.
The other day while my wife was asleep_comma_ i ate her leftovers

Thank you_comma_ i feel better overall too.
Yup_comma_ losing weight is just a side benefit.
I really like to watch all  of the old tv shows that were on when I was a kid. I watch them with my kids sometimes. But they usually just make me feel really old when we do this.

I'm so glad my wife and son gets to stay home during the day
They do_comma_ it is great for my son

They are! I love them they are super nice
I was at the store and I saw a guy carrying like 20 bags! It was amazing!
I didn't see anyone with him_comma_ but he must be trying to prove something
Every time I tell my Mom about something my child did that is so neat to me_comma_ my sister-in-law chimes in about something her child did to top it. It drives me crazy.
Yeah_comma_ I try to be understanding because she seems like she feels like she has something to prove when I'm all about not competing and having understanding for people's lives.  I have even said that in a nicer way and it doesn't get through to her. Its made being around her unbearable which is sad.
I was at the store and I dropped my wallet. Luckily some old man picked it up and gave it back to me before I even noticed!
Yeah_comma_ its good to know there are still good people in this world
I have a very good feeling about this football season for the Chargers

Thank you very much. Yes_comma_ it's always really hard to lose a pet you are so close to. My finacee is urging me to get another puppy to help the feeling pass.
Spent a lot of my saturday organizing and cleaning my room. There's no better feeling that knowing you accomplished an errand you were supposed to do_comma_ and getting to enjoy clean space after your hard work.
Yeah_comma_ it's kind of a shame my roommate isn't the cleanest. So_comma_ when I bother to clean the other areas of the apartment_comma_ it kind of goes to waste. But at least I can kind of keep up my own little domain and use it as a retreat from the rest of the place.
I was mad last week when my landlord was taking their time fixing my ac. It was so hot
I do not think they cared
My roommate always pees all over the toilet seat.
I know right? At least clean it off if you miss the mark. Makes me so mad.
I amde enough money lately that i feel comfortable and ready to take on anything!
You will get there too! I just know my future will hold good things.
Just go back from walking the dog_comma_ he was a perfect angel on the leash
Half bulldog and half german shepherd. He's just a puppy. That why a nice walk is so relaxing. He's usually a going concern.
Oscar. He's sleeping now_comma_ and I get a few moments of peace and quiet.
I love having my kitty snuggling up to me.  I feel so loved!
Cats will make you love animals!   They can be so affectionate.  
Haha I can see that.  I have had a few mean ones but I just deal with them.
Been making a lot of money off of my hobby lately. I think this thing might take off and I can quit my day job... I had no idea that would happen_comma_ or that people would enjoy my work enough to do that.
So_comma_ I make boats. It's a little time consuming_comma_ but I've loved woodworking_comma_ and my dad was a sailor_comma_ so I've been around boats all my life. I decided to combine the two. I figured when I made them_comma_ I might as well sell them_comma_ since I only have use of so many of them. Well... it's turned into quite the money-maker.
Canoes and rowboats_comma_ mainly. Things that are somewhat easy to make in terms of time and scale.

I'm getting a masters in education. Yeah_comma_ I feel like summer break has been good but it's time to get back on it.
It is unfortunately! Yes_comma_ I am doing that full time in a high school now. 
My dogs are like my children to me and I can't stand when they are outside to long!
Its weird how much love you can have for something that can't even talk to you and not even the same species but I love my doggies so much.
When I found out my brother was moving when I was younger_comma_ it really hurt me. I was going to miss him
We live closer now_comma_ but I hated it when he moved
My girlfriend enjoys going out with her friends for lady night once a month. I dont mind since I know she wont do anything stupid.
Some people get really jealous but I have no reason to be.
i had a interview last week! i think im getting the promotion at work
Yeah im really excited for the results1
We put an offer down on a house that I really want.
Yeah I think there's a reallly good chance they accept our offer of 27 million!
This week_comma_ my manager told me bad comments about my work performance. It made me feel bad.
No_comma_ there were not. The project is not making progress as expected mainly because he is bad manager. He is trying to find excuses.
It's almost time for NFL!
Oh yeah i love football_comma_ do you?
My brother was hurt the other day and i felt so bad.
He fell down and busted his head open. My life kind of changed. I felt so much care for him.
Oh no! Are you OK?
I was on a train in Sri Lanka. I asked the passengers if I was at the right stop. They told me no. Turns out I was at the right place.
I dont think they understood what I was asking.
A little bit_comma_ but I have a problem  assuming everyone speaks English in a foreign county that I visit.
I stole money from my daughter's piggy bank and now she's wondering where her money went
I bought a few beers. I feel terribly guilty about it now. 
I came home to my back door being kicked in
Intruder they went through all of my stuff
I feel bad when I do not make it to church. I know I should be there
I get busy or oversleep sometimes
I sometimes catch myself looking at my husband and kids and thinking to myself that my life is good.
It really is_comma_ and sometimes it is things like that_comma_ that people take for granted
My kids got a ton of Halloween candy last year. Didn't think they would notice if I ate just a few of them.
Not at first but I kept eating them and they caught me red-handed one day. I felt so bad I had to go buy them more.
Mostly chocolate which is what I am addicted to.
I am going to be happy next weekend. I am going on a nice little trip
To asheville north carolina
I finally got my BA. I am so happy to be done with college?
And it takes 4 years or more. Im still debating grad school.
Maybe. I dont want to be in debt for the rest of my life.

I have hope that the world will get better.
there are too many bad people in the world_comma_ i hope the good overcomes the bad
my grandma was rushed to the hospital im not sure what is going on
me too but we are not expecting good news
There is a coworker sitting next to me that he is making noise with his pen the whole day long. It is disturbing me from my work.
I already told him but he said he can't concentrate without having something in his hands.
I was on the bus the other day and saw the grossest thing.
Someone left something and it started molding and was growing so much.
I know right_comma_ so gross.
There is a bunch of crime near me right now_comma_ i hope the police can get it taken care of
Not usually_comma_ just all of the sudden
There was this one time years ago that we threw a party and I got so drunk_comma_ I do not remember anything! You know it is bad when you have people telling you what all you did and you can not remember any of it
Tell me about it_comma_ nothing like having someone tell you that you strpped down and jumped into the pool while everyone was still there. Glad those days are behind me
I live in an area with a lot of cottage properties. It blows me away some of the toys people have
Boats_comma_ ATVs and jet-skis. Oh_comma_ motor homes too. I have a  canoe lol
I don't have water access where I live but the beach is not far awayu
There is so much crime near me its getting ridiculous 
We are hoping too soon!
I care for my girlfriend a lot_comma_ we are very close
We have been together for almost 3 years now
I stole from my friend and i feel pretty bad about it.
I needed shrimp for a recipe and he had some.
no_comma_ i don't want to admit it.
I got approved for a scholarship for college that I had been competing for for many months!
I agree_comma_ I wanted to attend a higher ranking school but they didn't give me any scholarship so I decided not to accept their offer. 
This sounds weird_comma_ but I'm excited because I'll have some free time tomorrow to do some deep cleaning on my apartment. It's been messy since I've been gone most of the summer. I want to get it clean before school starts so I can enjoy it being fresh during the semester
Yeah_comma_ I'm the type of person to get stressed out and become unable to work in an environment that's too cluttered or dirty. It starts to make me feel claustrophobic. I have a good gene I guess_comma_ because cleaning relaxes me_comma_ while to others it's like a chore.
When I came home from work yesterday_comma_ the front door was open and the lock broken.
Looks like it. I was so afraid that I instantly called the police and went to my neighbors house until they arrived. 
I hate parents that censor every TV show_comma_ movie_comma_ video game_comma_ or song on the radio. Of course it's one thing to let a 5-year-old watch "Silence of the Lambs"; but do you really expect to raise the next Einstein by blinding him to the real world? By the time he's 13 he or she's gonna have some serious repression issues and grow up to be a weirdo
Yes I'm glad you see it that way.  Which is why I think despite all the shortcomings Millenials have we're probably going to be the best generation of parents in history lol
My brother won a championship in karate. I am so happy for him!
he is already black.
I will be taking a trip to SE Asia next week. I cant wait.

I ate my husbands leftovers while he was asleep

I am nervous about monday. I have to go to the doctor again
I am still coughing a lot
My son started getting into a little bit of trouble and got kicked out of summer school on the first day_comma_ so he decided to sign up for a youth chalenge program
He has been there for 5 weeks_comma_ I got to see him for the first time last Saturday. With him being gone I find myself anxious with him not being able to call home or come home
I've recently been on a weight loss program.  I've done very well.  I've lost 30 lbs!
Yes_comma_ but because of this_comma_ my pants have been loose.  The other day_comma_ my hands were full carrying boxes.  My pants fell down to my ankles while I was walking!!!
I am really happy with my tattoo artist. He is not charging me a lot for great work
They can be very expensive
My mom said she'd go to the doctor the next time she started feeling weird heart palpitations again. I'm about a thousand miles away from her_comma_ so I can't force her to go. But I'm worried about her_comma_ as she's always avoided the doctor_comma_ and always been in poor health. Hope she does the right thing
Sort of.. we have a neighbor that's been by her for 10 years_comma_ and they've been friends for a long time. But she's older herself_comma_ and has her own worries_comma_ so it's not like I can put more on her plate. My mother is just stubborn. I love her to death_comma_ but she's kind of a "What will be_comma_ will be" type person_comma_ and just assumes life will happen and you can_comma_ nor should_comma_ do anything to get in the way of it.
I've gotten some bad publicity in the past.
Undeserved_comma_ buy I'm the only one that thought so.
My car engine start smoking but my mechanic arrived and fixed my car within an hour!
I agree I was thoroughly impressed by his expertise. I was glad to be back on the road so quickly. 
I've been long distance with my girlfriend for about 6 years_comma_ mainly because I've been in university for a while. But I graduate this spring_comma_ and I'm going to propose to her after the ceremony. She's been patient this entire time_comma_ and hopefully it will all pay off.
I hope so. I owe a lot to her. She motivated me to get off of my behind and make something of myself and go to school. Before her_comma_ I was just an unproductive man-child_comma_ playing games at my parent's house. Now I've moved out_comma_ work part-time while going to school.. It's time to pay her back.
My uncle is going to come after me. I didn't graduate.
You are right but my unle is a simple man and he gave me a warning about me not graduating.
I am pretty happy with my life right now_comma_ it is going pretty well overall
It sure is_comma_ I hope things stay like this for a long time!
I was going through my attic and found some of my old childhood toys
You are right and I am really looking back fondly on some times in the past
My dad knew I was having some financial difficulties and decided to pay off my car loan! I am so appreciative to him!
I really am!  I will do whatever I can to repay the kindness!
I clogged the toilet at work yesterday. I had to take a huge dump and there was nothing to do about it. The toilet couldn't handle it. I couldn't fix it_comma_ either. So_comma_ I just quietly whisked away. I feel bad for the janitor that has to deal with it
That's true. But I wish there was something I could have done to make it easier on him. I've always had random small talk with him_comma_ and he's the nicest person. I just feel like a gross slob.
i was at a rangers game and this guy attacked a kid over the shirt he was wearing
yeah it just made me upset so i had a argument with him
When my husband and I first got together he use to talk to his ex girlfriend all the time cause she was with one of his friends. I despised that woman
I did_comma_ he said she did not mean anything to him and stopped going over to his friends house 
Last week I stole a donut from my boyfriend's desk_comma_ I was really hungry
Haha yes_comma_ he wondered where it went. I told him the dog ate it.
It was my birthday and i just knew my dad was gonna get me a car for my 16th.
well yeah but it was only a mercedes_comma_ I thought he was gonna get me a lamborghini...
My mom is the best. my mom gave me the benefit of the doubt when i got a DUI.
Yes_comma_ i thought she would disown me but she ended up supporting me.
My friends went on vacation without me_comma_ and now I have no one to hang out with for 3 weeks. 
Yes but I couldn't go because of work. Guess I will have to suck it up and be lonely for a while.
I let my guard down around my best friend and she told all my secrets away
Yeah_comma_ gotta cut her out of my life. Loyalty is so important in a friend.
I am upset with how I acted at work the other day_comma_ I lashed out when I should not have
Not yet_comma_ but I think I will soon
I miss the smell of burnt hay in the fall_comma_ my hometown farmers used to do it every year.
Yeah_comma_ I wish I visited more often_comma_ but my job keeps me away.
I have the best dentist.
I was really impressed by his care.
I ate my wife's leftovers while she was taking a nap
Steak and gravy!
I got this chick's number yesterday and I wasn't expecting it.  I was about to fight this one guy who was talking crap to me but he ran away like a little bitch and she and her friend saw everything...I thought they were gonna start avoiding me...but they actually chatted me up asking me where I'm from and now she's still texting me haha
Maybe a little haha I was pretty heated though...glad it turned out for the better
Phew! The recent storm narrowly missed my neighborhood!
Yes I do and grateful for that luck. Wouldnt want my new Porsche to get dented! 
I found a home and bought it and i can't believe i was able too.
Absolutely! I feel so lucky.
I was scared last year at this time. I had a couch that would not go away
Dang. I meant a cough that would not go away. Sorry about that
When I was in elementary school_comma_ I forgot the words to my solo in a school play.
Yeah_comma_ I suppose so. Still_comma_ I remember being super embarrassed_comma_ I still think about it sometimes too.
I have a pretty awesome husband.
He works hard for our family so I can stay home with our son.
I got really upset when I got home today and my cat pooped on the bed.
I had to clean it up_comma_ but not before I yelled at her and showed her what she did.
My wife has out of town for a couple weeks and we just moved to this city. I feel so bored and have no one to hang out with.
That's actually a really good idea!  I am always on reddit anyways!
I was scared last week driving home. My car was driving weird
The handling was harder than usual
Feeling good about this application.
Nope applied to my dream school actually.
We got this new printer at work and it MAKES ME SO MAD!!!!
EVERYTHING!!! I dont know who's bright idea it was to buy a laserjet printer for work but it was so stupid!!
Yeah I probably will.  Maybe I'll throw it in the pond outside.
I totaled my brand new car yesterday. 
 I do thankfully. It was some kid who didn't have a license. I'm still sad because it was my first car ever. 
My fiance and I celebrate our 6th year anniversary on Monday!
No_comma_ we are broke.  We are going out to dinner and maybe a movie but last year for our 5th we both forgot it till the next day!
A friend of mine who works for me (really with me) was recently offered another job for a little more pay.  I was quite nervous on what he would decide.  In fact_comma_ he never even mentioned it to me.  I found out through an acquaintance that he had been offered the job.
It wasn't so much jealousy.  I just depend on him a lot.  What was funny was that I asked him about it_comma_ and he told me_comma_ "I never mentioned it because I never considered it.  We've got too good a thing going here."  I was amazed at his loyalty.  
I most certainly do.  He really is a good friend.  I won't forget that.  I just hope I become as good a friend to him as he has been to me.
A mosquito has been flying around my face all day and its really starting to get to me.
I do! I am beyond annoyed and will try to obliterate it with my hand if I see it again.
I feel horrible. I let go of all of my friends and don't know how to move forward.
They live a drug culture.
I was cut off today and crashed my car into a pole to avoid colliding with someone.
I am_comma_ just a little bit winded. Also very angry that the person just drove away like nothing happened!
My husband will be away on a trip for the weekend and it will be so quiet without him here.
Thank your husband for his service! We appreciate him!
This girl just invited me out on a date. She seems sweet and I'm interested.. more interested in her than I am this other girl I've been seeing for a few weeks. But I feel bad just dropping this girl I've been seeing recently. Like_comma_ wouldn't that be rude?
That's some good advice. I think my main problem is I don't know if it's just a "grass is greener" type situation. I've enjoyed my time with the first girl_comma_ but there's not a big "spark." But who knows if there actually has to be one? Guess I'll have to think on it more.
My grandpa gave me his pocket watch
Yep he got it in Bangladesh in 1937
My friend bought me dinner tonight. It made me really appreciate him
No_comma_ it was pretty random which was nice
I have an old truck that when I drive it brings back memories from the past.

My puppy died right after my cat.
It is horrible_comma_ i dont know what to do.
The results came in and I won the national debate championship with my team!
I agree_comma_ it was a proud moment for us! I had to sacrifice a lot of time and energy to be able to get here. 
I'm finally able to afford decent health insurance for once in my life. Not only does it feel good to know I'm covered for some unexpected bad stuff_comma_ but I can actually go to the dentist and optometrist and keep up with my teeth/eye health for once.
Yeah. I mean I was a home-body and lives a pretty boring life_comma_ so I never truly felt in danger of not having health insurance in the past. But it was still a pretty stupid way to live. One accident could have ended it all in terms of financial health.
I am mad at my brother because he broke my bike. He always want to use my stuff and he ends up breaking it.
He is never going to pay or fix it. I already asked him for something else that he broke. He never did pay or fix it.
I got an unfamiliar present in the mail addressed to me but I had no idea who sent it!
I did. It was a PS4 console. Not a bad surprise to wake up to on a Sunday morning! 
My best friend's grandmother passed away. 
Doing okay_comma_ just a lot to process.
Just got my marks back.
My math test grades_comma_ i failed the test somehow.
I met a South Korean living in Argentina. He spoke perfect Spanish. Turns out hes fleeing the draft.
He didnt want to serve at the DMZ.
I dont know. I was just surprised because there is no actual war. He just has to mostly observe. He would have to kill If a North Korean soldier tried to cross.
I am very happy. My son was top of the class_comma_ this year.
Yes_comma_ I am. I bought him to new bike as a reward.
I found some of my old baseball stuff_comma_ great memories

Oh for sure_comma_ parenting is no joke. 
I'll be getting a raise in February and I'm really looking forward to it.
It's nearly 25%_comma_ it's going to make things a lot easier.
A person assured me that nothing would happen. She calmed my nerves down about to be pushed into my arm
I had to have surgery

i was at walmart and saw all the old board games from my childhood
Risk and Monpoly i have not played them in years
I was on a flight earlier in the week_comma_ listening to music. I thought my earbuds were plugged into my iPod correctly so that only I could hear the music.. turns out it wasn't_comma_ and everyone could hear it on speaker the entire time. I just assumed it was hard to hear because of the loud plane.. nope. People listened to my death metal with me for two hours and said nothing.
Well_comma_ no one was sitting immediately right beside me_comma_ it was kind of a half empty flight. But I know other peeps could hear it. Thinking back_comma_ now I realize why sometimes people would kind of glance over their shoulder at me. Yeah man_comma_ why didn't they speak up
my cat keeps bting me!
12 years.
Old age i gues. it stinks i miss him a lot
I  left most of my belongings at a hostel for 2 months. Everything was still there when I got back."

Me too. I think I'll travel light next time.
We went to Six Flags yesterday and I felt so uneasy as I looked at the looming rollercoaster.
In Georgia. The rollercoaster ended up being very thrilling despite my earlier apprehension!
I found some of my old baseball gear_comma_ it brought back great memories
Lol nope_comma_ i gained a lot of weight when my wife was pregnant
I let my cousin look after my dog whilst I went on vacation this summer. 
It went well_comma_ my dog came back happy and healthy. My cousin did well to pay off my trust. 
I ruined my friends wedding because of my drunken behavior
Yea I saw video of my inexcusably drunk behavior. I feel so ashamed that I haven't been able to look my friend in the eye since then.
I never thought I'd say it but these days I'm just stoked waking up and living the dream...I'm fully self-employed and answer to NOBODY and I have full autonomy of time_comma_ making more money than I did my previous crappy job...it's great
Yes you have no idea...still grinding it out everyday but it's totally worth it
sadly we got word our grandmothers canceris back

My 12 year old lab just passed away. He was my buddy and I am really upset about losing him.
It really is.  I am just so broken up over it.
My daughter had a school project that I helped her assemble_comma_ after we was done with it she informed she wanted it on wheels. Sometimes kids can be such a pain.
Lol. Yes they will be. Just would have been nice to know she wanted it on wheels at the beginning of the project
My friend called me out for being noisy and rude at the dinner last night. It was a rude awakening for me.
Looks like it. And I was making everyone else feel uncomfortable too. i feel so ashamed that I made my own friends feel uneasy. 
my roommate will not clean anything.
yes_comma_ but his actions do not listen to me.
Next week_comma_ I am going in work trip to New York. I can't wait to go.
Yes_comma_ I am going to have some free time. I am also given 150 dollars that I can use for my free time.
I was cut off this morning on the way to work. It caused me to crash into the ditch. I am so mad.
I had to get it towed to the shop. We will see how bad it is. 
My license got lost in the mail and I had to go back to the dmv to get a new one.
It does and the wait at the dmv is always long. I was so irritated.
I wish that Summer wasn't almost over.
Yeah_comma_ I like the fall_comma_ but the change does make me a bit sad. It's a growing older type of thing.
I cannot wait for the new super smash bros_comma_ it is gonna be amazing
It is_comma_ you have never heard of it?
I am jealous of my coworker_comma_ he is very smart and athletic
I can_comma_ but I cannot get any smarter

i just did not think it came together well overall
My dad just graduated college!
I am! He is such an amazing man.
The summer hurricane violently ripped through my neighborhood and destroyed everything in its path. 
Yes_comma_ I am thankful for that. But devastated that my house and property have been swept away overnight. 
I can't get myself to throw away my late dogs toys_comma_ despite them being so old and torn up. 
I suppose_comma_ sentimental value more than monetary value. 
Ew what a gross wound my brother had.
He crashed his bike and cut it up badly_comma_ it was disgusting.

My 15 year old stole a family members bank card number and overdrawn the account by $500. I was so mad I asked him about it and he had the nerve to lie to me even with the proof that I needed
Oh I did. I was always told that newborn years was the worse but raising know it all teens is the worse_comma_ makes me miss the newborn stage
I sheltered an injured owl and nursed him back to health before setting him free.
Thank you. I gave me great satisfaction to care for him though I felt a bit sad when I had to let him go home. 
My boyfriend took me to a cat cafe today because he knows I like cats
I don't think so? They have cats there up for adoption from the local shelter. You can have coffee and pet them.
My son just took his first steps.
I was so proud! He is 13 months.
I found myself shocked today by my roommate.
They left a mess in the toilet and didn't flush it!
I was going through some old photos the other day and also came across a bunch of stuff that my kids have made me through the years_comma_ It brought back so many great memories
It sure was! Some of the stuff I had forgotten about_comma_ so it was great coming across all those things
A friend that I had during college came to visit me last week. I was not expecting him to contact me. It has been at least ten years that we didn't see each other.
Yes_comma_ we had a great time. We are planning to see each other this week.
Walked in my kitchen this morning and there was a huge spider in the sink.
I grabbed a spatula to kill it_comma_ but it had already disappeared!

I'm hoping to get a big bonus at work
Yeah it is nice to be able to go out and just spend a little money!
The place I ate at for lunch today only had a "B" rating for cleanliness_comma_ etc. on their health inspection. I never ate at a place that had less than an "A." But I ate there anyway since there wasn't anything else close by_comma_ and it smelled good and was cheap_comma_ and I'm poor.. I just know my stomach is going to be churning later
Yeah_comma_ you know what they say. Play stupid games_comma_ win stupid prizes. Wish I could afford better_comma_ but I'm a broke college student. I guess the bright side is the bad food won't be in my body for long..
My favorite time of the year is during the holidays. My family gets together and talks about our lives. It is such a merry time.

My wife and I have been together for 5 years
Just staying faithful.  That girl is so loyal I love her so much. 
Hey thank you!  She would never cheat on me and I have faith in that.  I would NEVER EVER do the same.
I brought my friend out and he made a complete idiot of himself.
he was and yea it was_comma_ he completely ruined the night out.
I often get so annoyed having pictures taken of me_comma_ and getting asked to smile. I hate my teeth_comma_ since they're so big. I wish I had smaller_comma_ more natural teeth that other people do.. it makes me so paranoid sometimes.
I appreciate that. And I try to tell myself that imperfections help people stay grounded and kind. But it's still hard not to get so self-conscious about it in everyday life. I almost want to grab something and grind them down!
My husband put together a graduation party for me and I had no idea!
It was_comma_ I was so thankful to him and I was also thankful to be done with school! 
My son went into a youth challenge program. I am hoping that this will help him become better person and give him the discipline that he needs.
It had alot to do with the crowd he was keeping at school. their habits was rubbing off on him. I tried talking to him several times about it but of course with being the mother he acted like I did not know what I was talking about. He is not just horrible but I knew if something did not change it would have gotten worse
I tripped over the sidewalk the other day_comma_ thankfully no one was around
Just scraped my knee a little. I'll be fine. But I'm so clumsy all the time it's a bit frustrating.

My teenager almost got kicked out of school when he was 16 because he kept getting caught with tobacco after the 5th time they said enough was enough and was really close of kicking him out for the rest of the year
Me too! It was a very close call
My father in law makes sure I am taken care of and he is the sweetest guy in the world.  It makes me feel special.
Yeah I do with him at least.  Do you have people you can count on?

It is! Its best feeling and is a weight off my shoulders! I am finally content with my finances. 
I am applying to graduate school and I am a little anxious about it!
The interview is what is making me nervous!
I really want a Chanel bag for Christmas_comma_ my friend got one and it's so beautiful.
Me too! They are very pricey_comma_ but I've had my eye on the mini rectangle for a long time.
My son is turning 2 in a few months.
We are having a small get together with family and friends and his favorite jumpy place.
I'm going to eat sushi for the first time this coming weekend.
Thanks for the recommendations! I'm a bit nervous about it_comma_ but I hope I will enjoy it.
Tomorrow might just be scary.  Not sure if I should go or not. 
We're going to six flags.  I've never ridden a coaster before.
They seem dangerous to me.  Oh well.  I might try it.  I'll bring an extra pair of undies.
My husband an I thought we would treat ourself toa nice dinner. I went to take a bite and looked down_comma_ thank goodness I did_comma_ there was a really nice piece of hair wrapped around my food
I sure did. Told the waiter that I wanted to talk to the manager. When he came out I was real nice about it. Just happy I did not have topay for it
Football season is about to start. I used to always watch the opening day games with my dad. I'm halfway across the country now though_comma_ and we won't be able to do it in person for a long time. Makes me miss him
Eh_comma_ we're not really the type to do that. Especially not him. And it's not worth it. Just a phone call here or there. Just miss the tradition is all. We're big family people
I don't know if its weird but I am most comfortable laying in bed watching TV and hanging out from there.
Yeah for sure_comma_ I still like people but not everyday and my fiance is usually enough for me with my animals!
My 5 year old son is already reading! He picked up on it so fast!
My daughter was also but I didn't want to put any pressure on him since all kids are so different and it didn't matter.  But he astounded me and loves reading and writing.  
I didn't get the big promotion at work.
There are promotions that come up quite often within my company_comma_ so I am hoping for another chance within the month.
SO I dropped my wallet in the train_comma_ and when I bent down to pick it up_comma_ I accidentally released a  loud fart. Worse of it call_comma_ there was lady who was sitting and heard it! 
I hope so_comma_ she pretended not to hear but I know she heard it. It was just so embarrassing and left me red faced! 
I didn't get a big promotion at work_comma_ I worked so hard for it.
I was_comma_but I will try harder next time.
I dont like uncertainty. I like to know what is going to happen.
Im not sure what I want to do career wise.
Yes_comma_ but not in my major.
I am done with Uni. Im thinking of going back and getting a different major.
I have been alone for almost 5 years now. 
Living alone because my wife passed away.  I miss her very much.
Was walking down the street yesterday and some little twerp ran his skateboard right into me_comma_ and he slammed into the back of my knee. It's been throbbing all day and it's swollen. Pretty sure something's messed up. I'm ready for bad news. At least I have insurance now.
Yeah_comma_ I've been lazing all day. I'm already starting to feel really fat. I want to find that lil chump and ring his neck.. hopefully my insurance covers all I need it to
My current employer is having big financials problem. I am afraid that the company will go into bankruptcy.
I started looking. I have been with this company for so long that I forgot how to write a resume and how to look efficiently for a job.
First time in a long time I've gotten a haircut that I'm satisfied with. For once my big head doesn't look so big. I actually don't feel too stupid looking!
Just some barber who found a way to give me what I like without me being able to say it. That's always been my problem_comma_ I have problems describing it_comma_ and feel dumb trying to find pictures showing it. I just told him to do what he think would look good.. luckily it worked
my dog is sick we took him into the vet and now we are playing the waiting game
yeah it is scary to think we could lose him...
I loved my previous job.
I cared for patients in the emergency room.
I get to go on vacation with my husband and kids on Monday. I am so excited!
We are going to Wisconsin to see my family. We havent seen them since Christmas.
My daughter is pregnant with her first child. I am optimistic everything will go smoothly.
She is due around Thanksgiving. It will be a great time to give thanks!
She's have a girl! I am so excited!
Sometimes I feel like I have so much going on that I feel overwhelmed and over ran with anxiety that it makes it hard to stay focused on everything
That makes sense. I am going to start trying that more
My friends just recently purchased a brand new_comma_ new car smelling_comma_ 2019 Honda Civic.
Well_comma_ for me_comma_ I am honestly angry.  I look at their success and feel it should be me!  
You are probably right.  I feel like such a terrible friend for feeling that way.  Nevertheless_comma_ it is a little motivation for me to work that much harder.  
Just had to tell mom I stole some candies_comma_
I hope so too_comma_ but I feel quite guilty regarding it_comma_
I have hope that I will get into grad school.
School Counseling.
I would be a school counselor_comma_ so how to deal with issues in school and also development.
Just got such a big award at the game.
It was a hockey game I scored 8 goals and won the MVP.
I just bought my first house.  I get to move in next week.
I really am.  My wife and I are going to go puppy shopping the day after we move in since we can finally have one!
I am so happy with my life right now.
I have the best husband and son I could ever ask for!
I saw this creepy looking clown peering in my window the other night. I almost jumped out of my skin.
I ran into the basement and hid in a closet. I have been down here ever since. At least I got Internet access.
my boyfriend took me to a haunted house 
no it was scary!
I make the good fluffy cheesecake. But sometimes it's hard because the egg whites have to be perfectly beaten.
Yes_comma_ they enjoy it a lot. I always like making it for them.
I love so much my wife. She has been so caring and kind with me.
I am bad cooker but I take her frequently for dinner in restaurant.
I get so flustered whenever there is a training class at work and I have to get up in front of everyone and walk out.  I dread if I have to use the restroom or get water!
It really is_comma_ I just have social anxiety really bad I think.
My friend just won a lottery and got tickets to the Superbowl and I lost! 
I dont think he can since he only won one ticket. I am beyond jealous right now but also happy for him since he really wants to go. 
we went to disney with the kids it was amazing
land!
My mom gave me one of our old photo albums the other day.
Yeah it really brought back some great memories!
i was in the break room and took a extra doughnut
no but i still feel bad about it
I am all packed and ready to go see my family!
Yes! We are driving up to see them on Monday.
It is a 7 hour drive. It takes  a little longer with bathroom breaks though.
I recently found that I was adopted. I felt terrible bad.
I had an argument with my oncle. He is one that told me. He told me "You are not part of this family!!! You are adopted!!!"
I lost my swim bottoms going down the slide at the water park.
It was horrible_comma_ but I recovered! No shame.
My apartment complex is nickel and diming me and counting off so many things wrong with the apartment to detract from my security deposit as I get set to leave after this month. I know people said to expect to never see your security deposit again_comma_ but this is ridiculous! I feel like the apartment is pretty much exactly the same
It's a racket. The building is from the 1950s and has hardly been updated. Of course everything is going to look like crap. They just splash the cheapest white paint everywhere. At least there's no carpet in mine that would need to be replaced. Bleh
My boss informed me that I am in the first position of getting the promotion
Thanks_comma_ my confidence in my abilities is just getting better and better!
People can give me all the bullshit advice they want on how to live my life and how I need to know my place in society....but I'll just smile and nod because I only trust my instincts and am have ridiculously more freedom_comma_ money and happiness than I've ever had before
Exactly.  Funny thing is they're usually the same people that bitch and moan on Facebook about having a job or boss they hate but do nothing to change their path it's hilarious
i was inbed last night and heard a loud bang in the kitchen
yeah i was sneaking in there when i found the cat looking as guilty as can be
I have an overseas trip coming up. I have never been and I am feeling a little scared right now about going.
Yea but I have never been in a foreign country before.
I was watching professional rodeo last night. I was amazed at how the cowboyos can stay on the bulls so long.
Yeah they must practice a lot. I would be afraid of getting trampled.
I am waiting to see if I pass the GRE.
Thank you_comma_ I am trying my best. 
What a scary night that was.
My house burned night earlier_comma_ had to get my mom out.
I was going through the stuff in my attic last night
Yeah I found some old pictures of when us kids used to go to my grandma's house for xmas
Yeah reminds me of the good old days.  I miss my grandma.  She passed away about 15 years ago. 
I woke up this morning to my wife telling me she's pregnant!
It is soooo awesome.  We have been wanting a baby for so long.  I can't wait_comma_ but I was shocked out of a dead sleep!
